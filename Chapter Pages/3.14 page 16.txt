“I’m just saying! There could be bandits, or monsters—”
“You’ll just have to defend me, then.”
“Me!?”
“Of course you! You’re my [Paladin], after all, aren’t you?”
“I guess…”
“Oh come now. Don’t worry, Durene! What’s the worst that could go wrong?”
Frostwing squawks in my ear, and Durene giggles. I sit back as Gamel starts talking about being an adventurer and maybe even going to Wistram, and Durene excitedly asks him what magic he’d study, and turn my face up to the sky.
I can’t tell whether it’s cloudy or clear skies above me. And maybe that’s a good thing, because I can always imagine that there’s a blue, clear sky overhead and the sun is shining bright. I’ve never seen blue, but I imagine it’s the color of adventure, of a new day.
Of hope.
Of course, I’ve always thought green was a rather hopeful color as well. But who ever heard of a green sky? Ah well, it’s all the same to me.
The wagon rumbles on as I, Laken Godart, [Emperor], prepare to go to Invrisil, the City of Adventurers to save my poor village from starvation and monsters. I lie back, breath in. And at last—
I begin to explore this vast world.
