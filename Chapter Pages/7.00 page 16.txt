They shook hands. Selys smiled as she gestured to the line. There was a long one! It stretched down the street. Fals glanced at it. Then around.
“A lot of people are waiting. Is the door open? I heard it was broken and that the inn was closed. Hey, is Erin alright? I heard a lot of things. And the Horns…”
He trailed off. Selys smiled, but a bit sadly.
“They’re all okay. At least, I think so. The Horns are north, actually. They’re going to Invrisil.”
“What?”
“They took one of Erin’s door-portals north. They left about a week and a half ago. Sorry, did you come here for them?”
Fals sighed.
“No. I just—I wish I’d had a chance to talk to them. I’m just glad they’re alive. I thought maybe I could see them, but the door—”
“Oh, right.”
The Drake grimaced. She twirled a ring on one of her claws.
“The city took it after the inn collapsed. They needed it to clear the Crelers from the Bloodfields. And the inn was broken, so it was in the city.”
“Oh. So there were Crelers?”
Selys’ eyes glinted.
“Yes. I’ll tell you about it. Or let someone else do that for me. I wasn’t there. I saw the aftermath, though.”
Fals shuddered.
“But Erin’s alive? She didn’t get hurt?”
“Not from the Crelers. I hope we’ll see her soon.”
Selys sighed. Fals wanted to ask more, but an impatient voice called out from behind them.
“Hey! What’s the hold up? I want ice cream! I haven’t had any for two weeks! Look at my paw! It’s shaking!”
A chorus of voices rang out in the line. Selys saw a few people opening and closing the door experimentally, but nothing happened. Fals pointed and she shrugged.
“The door should be opening soon. I was told it was going to the inn today.”
“So is the inn rebuilt or something?”
“Yup. The Antinium put it up. Well, it’s still in progress, but apparently they got the most important bits up. We just have to wait…say, why are you in Liscor?”
Fals patted his backpack.
“Delivery.”
“Ah.”
The two turned back to wait. And the Humans, Gnolls, and Drakes waited in line, patiently and impatiently, all wanting to see the familiar, or the mysterious [Innkeeper], the owner of The Wandering Inn.
But the first visitors to the inn weren’t coming from the magical door. Rather, they were walking. The two proceeded from Liscor’s eastern gates, travelling down the hill into a small valley, up the grassy slopes. They were talking. Well, arguing.
“That jerk. Captain Z is always getting on my tail. So what if I like to add a bit of humor to my work?”
“You threatened to stab a child in the knee.”
“I didn’t threaten! I suggested I might. Anyways, she wasn’t on the list, so what’s the problem?”
“Besides excruciating and long-lasting mental trauma?”
“Hah! That’s not real. Wait, is it?”
“Do you still dream about the time your tail got run over by a wagon?”
“Ooh. Oooh. It still stings! Don’t remind me about it. Anyways I’m not that bad at my job! And she can’t dock my pay!”
“You are the most inept [Guardsman] I have ever had the misfortune to work with.”
“Hey! You’re not perfect, buddy!”
“I am not your buddy. We are coworkers.”
The two figures toiled up the hill. Well, they didn’t toil very hard. But they did have to balance the huge doorframe between them as they climbed. Relc glared at Klbkch.
“We’re best buddies.”
“I find this statement difficult to accept.”
Klbkch stared back impassively. Relc waved one claw, easily carrying his half of the magical door.
“Don’t be a lizard, Klb. If you’re not my buddy, who is? We’re partners, and a team! You can’t spell team without me. And…without I. Wait, how does it go again?”
The Antinium sighed.
