“You needn’t worry. If I needed to, I could burn away any weak spells. Belavierr knows this. I’m tired. But my aura is strong as ever.”
Ser Raim reassured Ryoka. She glanced at him. He smiled. He was so old now. He glanced at her as she led him towards Rie’s house. Entered it, as two [Summer Knights] rode towards them. Ser Raim waved them away. He sat down inside.
“I have a few artifacts here. My bag of holding. Help me set them up, please.”
He handed Ryoka a stack of talismans. Like Japanese ofuda talismans. Then what looked like bright orbs of glass. They hung around the room, swaying. Flickering.
“Bad magic?”
“Her spells. Those charms are Drathian. You don’t need to worry about my safety. A [Witch] like Belavierr is powerful. But she must have my hair or some possession of mine to curse me. And even then, these wards work. Her magic is not all-powerful. It is ancient. But not—”
Ser Raim coughed. Ryoka found herself making tea. He sat, sipping it. He sighed. Then he looked at her again.
“You know the Stitch Witch. And you’re here to argue for her life.”
Ryoka froze. But the [Summer Knight] didn’t reach for his blade. She hesitated.
“I—want to. I’m not here to attack you. Just—I’ve met Belavierr. Talked to her. She didn’t offer me any deals, but I’ve…seen her.”
“Strange. She rarely talks to anyone that she does not want something from. I’ve searched for her for years and she rarely talks to anyone. Save for her victims.”
Ser Raim coughed. Ryoka nodded once.
“I’m—different. Wiskeria’s also here.”
“Her daughter?”
“Yes. Your friend took her hostage.”
“Gaile. But for that, Belavierr might have fled.”
“Yeah.”
The two sat in silence. Ser Raim waited. Ryoka burst out at last.
“I haven’t seen her commit any terrible crimes while she’s here. I’m sure she has. But Belavierr doesn’t seem evil to me. Just amoral.”
She paused, flushing.
“I’m sorry. I know this is stupid to argue with you—”
What was she doing? But Ser Raim didn’t bristle. He just sat back and sighed. And when he spoke, it was quietly.
“No. You’re hardly the first to say as much to me. And at this hour, it hardly matters. But you are right. Belavierr, the Stitch Witch. She has done good. There are tales of her making deals with slaves for their freedom, such that even Roshal calls her a threat. She has saved lives. But always she takes something she wants in exchange. Perhaps that is fair. But she kills at the behest of others as well. She has tricked. Deceived likewise. When she is desperate, she will use any means she desires.”
He set the tea cup down quietly on the table and looked at Ryoka.
“However. She does evil as well. Half of our number have lost someone to her. I lost my heart, my fiancé. Gaile her husband. The rest bear her no love. Some are in the hunt for the glory of it, like Faigen, who wields the hammer. Or because they see Belavierr’s crimes as unforgivable, like Sylind, the [Archer]. The [Mage Hunter], Erashelle is of that mind, although she may also desire Belavierr’s artifacts. Tagil does. But he would use it for the good of his family, and in truth, the reason matters not.”
He paused. And the lights flickered from the ward-spells. Raim looked at Ryoka and shook his head.
“For all she does good, she does evil. And she is a selfish existence. To live, she would drown cities in blood. She has done so before. She will do it again. I am sworn to protect innocents against evil. Could I ignore Belavierr’s existence? Even if I could—she slew my love.”
Ryoka had no answer to that. She could only hang her head. Ser Raim looked at her and shook his head.
