The bits of yellow on his body weren’t paint. They weren’t added on. The yellow color was part of the Antinium’s carapace. Irreversibly marking him. And where he walked, the people turned and stared. At a miracle. A truth too large to be a lie.
There he walked. And Pawn followed him, feet away. So close he could touch the broad back. A giant among Soldiers. Larger. Stronger. And he had a voice.
Yellow Splatters.
He stopped in front of the Hive. Amid a wave, a sea of Workers and Soldiers. They stared at him. There Yellow Splatters stood. And when he spoke next, it was just for them. To them.
“I have died. I have come back. I stand here to tell you all one thing. One truth I saw after I died with the others.”
He looked at Pawn. And the Worker trembled. He shook with guilt and regret. But Yellow Splatters gently took Pawn’s shoulders. He looked down into Pawn’s eyes.
“You were right. It is there.”
The Worker didn’t know what he meant. Then his legs grew weak.
“You saw it? Truly?”
The head nodded once.
“I saw it. Heaven. It exists. Believe. It exists.”
The Antinium stopped. The Hive looked up. Yellow Splatters gazed towards the sky and shook his head.
“It is not up. It is not down. And it is tiny. It is as fragile as this. As small as…”
He opened his hand and grasped at the air. He clenched his fist and met every eye.
“But it exists. And it is being built. It can be built. We must make it grow. So believe. Believe. And you will be saved.”
He looked around. Pawn fell to his knees. The Workers and Soldiers looked at Yellow Splatters.
They had all gone away. Soldiers and Workers. They had died for glory, ignobly, by ones and twos and by the thousands. But at last—after so long it had happened. Yellow Splatters had died, fighting for the Hive. He had sacrificed everything he had. But that was not what made him a hero. If that was so, all Antinium were heroes and none were. No. It was that Yellow Splatters had fought. He had gone to protect the Hive. And then he came back.
He came back.
That was all they had ever wanted. And Pawn knelt. He bowed. And he no longer needed to believe.
Because it was true.
