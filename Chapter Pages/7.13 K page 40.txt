I want to live. And for my people—Flos struck a blow as Raelt thundered past him. The [King] blocked, but the impact sent him reeling back on the saddle. His [Soldiers] surrounded him, shielding him as Raelt sagged, holding onto the saddle horn.
Flashes. The King of Destruction roared as he cut down the [Riders]. His Rustängmarder held, but Jecrass’ army kept fighting. Raelt sagged, knocked senseless by the blow.
The world went dark. Raelt heard a voice. Like his own, but vaster. Speaking into his head.

[Skill—
“—eward! On the left!”
Raelt opened his eyes. He saw Orthenon cutting through his riders. Flawlessly, his blade severing metal and body with ease. He was staring at Raelt, his expression twisted with fury.
“[Flurry Blades].”
Raelt whispered. His rapier blurred as the two shot towards each other. Orthenon’s spear flashed, blocking the volley of thrusts and cuts. He leaned over, slashed.
Flos Reimarch saw two of Raelt’s [Soldiers] block the slash along with their [King]. The [Soldiers] died. Raelt took a mortal wound along his side. But for healing potions he would have died. He clung to his saddle as Orthenon turned, but the [Steward] was under attack from all sides.
Jecrass’ army surged around Reim’s. They had broken up their formation, attacking and moving. The [Riders] dodged away from Mars as she swung a blade that cut the air with slashes of light that stayed and severed anything they touched, refusing to fight her.
But they couldn’t perfectly avoid Zamea, or Parasol Stroll. The half-Giant cut through a group of [Riders]. The [Mages] were blasting Jecrass’ warriors apart. And the Serpent Hunters were covering them. They were armed with bows, blowpipes—and their blades made anything they cut or struck die within seconds. Horses, people—
A slaughter, an echo of the battle with Belchan’s army. Raelt reeled as he drank a healing potion. He had to stay upright. Had to—
“There you are.”
Zamea turned. Raelt saw the huge half-Giant bring her axe up. He saw it coming down. And jumped.
The axe missed him. It split the earth. Raelt saw it bury itself in the hard ground, saw Zamea wrench. And he moved.
“[Flash Step].”
He blurred. And the King of Jecrass raced up the haft of the axe. First Shepherd Zamea saw the Human coming. She tried to let go, but too late.
Raelt raced up her arm, dodging her swatting hand. He saw her face turning. And he lunged.
His sword ran through Zamea’s cheek. Raelt heaved, and cut into the half-Giant’s cheek. She howled and tore at her face. He dodged backwards, saw the hand coming.
And jumped.
Raelt fell to earth. Thirty feet. He hit the ground poorly.

Up. Raelt saw his [Riders] surrounding him. Zamea raged, striking at them with her bare hands. But the sons and daughters of Jecrass refused to give way. They blocked her crushing blows.
Flos Reimarch saw Raelt grabbing another horse. The King of Jecrass raised his blade.
“To me!”
The King of Destruction felt a chill. He saw Raelt plunging forwards again. But he was marked. And this time it was Mars who found him.
Her hair was like fire. And her dark skin and eyes burned. Mars the Illusionist in her fury had changed her weapon and armor. She wielded the sword made of fire, but her armor now left afterimages as she raced across the battlefield. As fast as the horses. And her blade set them to flame, throwing riders.
“Raelt!”
