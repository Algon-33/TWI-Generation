He patted her on the shoulder again. Erin stared at him.
“Thank you for your honesty.”
“Welcome. Be shush.”
The Goblin went back to listening to the song. He was trying to come up with a guitar cover. Erin stood up. Sighing, she went to the door and opened it.
“Don’t play on the computer too long.”
She warned him. The Hobgoblin looked back at her.
“Why not?”
Erin opened and closed her mouth.
“…I think my mom told me that once. I dunno, maybe your head explodes. Okaygottago!”
She closed the door. And nearly ran into a young woman with fire in her hair.
“Oh! Excuse me!”
Erin smiled. So did the young woman.
“Pardon me. I was actually just looking around.”
“For the bathroom? It’s outside. Or if you wanted Octavia’s shop—it’s down the other hallway. Door at the end.”
Erin pointed. Octavia was now part of the inn and she was happy with it. Actually—she was more focused on her apprenticeship with Saliss to care. Erin was happy for her, even if Numbtongue grumbled that Octavia was too busy these days to go mining with him.
“Thank you, but I was actually looking for you, Miss Erin Solstice.”
The raven-and-ember-haired girl grinned. Her eyes were vibrant orange, Erin couldn’t help but notice. And she felt like she’d met her…
“Me? Uh. Do I know you? Wait—wait—aren’t you—?”
“Maviola. Pleased to meet you. Olesm and I have been stopping here regularly.”
“Oh. You’re Olesm’s girlfr—”
Erin bit her tongue. Olesm’s girlfriend? She had heard about it, but she hadn’t believed it. She gaped at Maviola.
“Are you?”
“I’m she. And you’re Erin Solstice. Do you have a moment?”
“I—uh—y—sure—hey! You were the one who threw alcohol all over me! Ceria’s noble friend! Wait, you’re a [Lady]!”
Erin remembered at last. Maviola’s teeth flashed. She bowed slightly, and it was elegant and charming.
“As I am charged, so guilty! I think our meeting has been long overdue, Erin. May I call you that?”
“Sure? But wait…why are we meeting? I mean…”
Erin found Maviola tugging her into another of the smaller private rooms. There was something about the young woman that was compelling. Erin found Maviola pulling out a chair. She smiled as she sat down. Erin frowned. Something…
“I’ve been wanting to talk with you. After all—you and I are similar. Have you noticed?”
“That we’re similar? Nah. I mean—you’re taller. And you have cool hair. Uh—we’re both Humans? I…is something…are you doing something to me?”
The [Innkeeper] narrowed her eyes. She couldn’t look away from Maviola. The fiery girl leaned on the table.
“Of course. The question is: what?”
Erin tried to look away. But her eyes were drawn to Maviola. Much like a moth was to light. Or eyes to a…fire. She felt it.
“Stop that. You—you’re using your aura-thing!”
“I am.”
“Stop that. You—you’re a [Lady]!”
Erin finally recognized the signs. It felt like Magnolia, Pryde, and Wuvren. Only—different. She had the impression she was sitting across from a bonfire. Maviola’s eyes locked on Erin’s.
“Make me.”
Erin struggled. She hadn’t been prepared for a fight, even a mental one. She bit her lip, tried to remember Lyonette’s lessons. Focus. Gather your will like—Erin pushed. She felt something pushing back, encircling her. She glowered.
“Stop. Doing. That!”
She shot up and flipped the table on Maviola. Or tried to. The table was too big. But Erin felt the force locking her down break. Maviola slipped back as Erin raised a fist.
“Get out of my inn! You [Ladies] are like—rats! Shoo!”
She punched. Maviola dodged backwards.
