“So you can carry my stuff?”
“This? Of course. I carried stuff twice as heavy every day when I was a soldier.”
Relc grinned at Erin and flicked Krshia’s bag dismissively. The Gnoll sniffed at Relc as Klbkch addressed Erin.
“We would like to visit your inn tonight, Erin. If that is not an imposition?”
“What? No! Come on, by all means! I’ll cook up a feast!”
Erin smiled happily at the two guardsmen. For once, it seemed like everything was back to normal in a good way. Relc was ebullient as he seized Erin’s shopping bag.
“Great! I want a lot of food tonight! You can take the cost of me hauling this to your inn out of my tab, okay?”
Klbkch’s elbow shot out and rammed Relc in the side. The Drake yelped and glared at his friend.
“I was just joking.”
“No. You weren’t.”
“Ants. This is why…”
Relc grumbled as he lifted the pack with ease. He looked around for support and found none. He scratched at the spines on his head, muttered under his breath, and then looked at Erin.
“Oh, hey. Your inn exploded by the way.”
Everyone stared at him. Relc looked at Klbkch, and then at Erin.
“What? Didn’t I say that earlier?”
