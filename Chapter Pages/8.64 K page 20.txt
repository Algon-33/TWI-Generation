If you were going to breakout, you hired the world’s fastest ship. And someone who had no problem with offending Wistram.
Yes, she’d been hired by Wistram, but so what?

Rasea Zecrew paused as she stood before the gates of Wistram. Her crew halted behind her. She raised a hand, and her first mate growled.
“Cold feet, Captain?”
She turned her head, a manic grin on her face. The same smile she’d had when she attacked Flos and the Minotaurs.
“Cold feet? Me? You could dunk me in Cenidau’s waters, and I’d come out steaming. Look at it, boys. Wistram.”
She spread her arms and took in the citadel. Rasea Zecrew spoke, turning to her crew.
“No [Pirates] have sacked Wistram for over eight thousand years. It was worth taking her money just for this. King of Destruction’s Seven or not…this is our entry into history.”
Her crew cheered. They had her crazy smile. If you knew Rasea—it wasn’t about money alone. It was about this.
“Into the halls of Wistram!”
The [Pirate Captain] laughed and charged through the doors, enchanted sword raised. Her crew stormed in after them.
“What th—”
The first [Mage] who met Rasea got a fist to the face and went over. Rasea saw one of her crew stop to grab the stave, battle-spellbook, and then try to remove the belt, bag of holding, and [Mage]’s robes.
Everything was loot! That gold statue? Loot! Golems? Loot! Wands, robes, spellbooks? The [Pirates] grabbed everything in sight. The confused [Mages] weren’t their targets—their gear was.
Even so, a Centrist tried to stop them and got two crossbow bolts through his legs for the trouble. The second [Mage] that Rasea met was a terrified Lizardman. He raised his wand, and she flicked it out of his hand.
The Lizardman, Cessic, stared up at the glittering tip of Rasea’s sword. He froze—and she grabbed him, yanked his bag of holding off his belt, tossed it to her [First Mate], then kissed him on the mouth.
“Haha! It was worth waiting all this time for her job!”
She laughed then pushed Cessic away. The [Mage] stumbled away as one of her crew threw a rope up.
“[Anchor Line]. We’re up, [Captain]! Where are we bound?”
“Find me a library. Once that Gazer gets here, we’re away. Until then—grab everything!”
Rasea grabbed the line, and, with a running start, took off. The semi-elastic rope swung her upwards, and she arced back, like someone on a swing. Cessic stared up as Rasea swung higher, flipping upwards like an [Acrobat] to land on one of the higher walkways in the entrance hall with a few of her crew.
“Wh—what? What’s happening?”
Wistram had [Pirates]. And they were just here for the fun of it all.

The primary choice of spell for the average [Mage] or student was [Light Arrow], [Flame Arrow], or another bog-standard arrow spell. Not a disarming spell like another magical academy.
Disarming spells were hard. You had to literally interfere with someone’s personal magical aura, yank something out of their grip—you could more easily cast [Force Arrow] and put them on their ass.
Higher-level [Mages], especially the duel-loving ones, used tricks like [Oiled Floor], and against Golems, they pulled out [Ice Spike], [Stone Fist], and all the other most common spells.
However, [Fireball]? [Acid Orb]? Let alone other Tier 4-6 spells? There were few flying in the air, even if the [Mages] could cast them.
This was not a killing ground. The Drakes were replying in kind, although most were using higher-grade bolt spells and attacks meant to subdue their opponents non-lethally.
Ullsinoi was the exception, of course, but the other one was…
The Golems.
