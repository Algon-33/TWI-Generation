Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 2)

Dekass said it as if it explained everything. Calruz frowned at him. Yes…if he thought of the two Prognugators in terms of his rats, Rhata was Dekass. She was a simple soul. Strong…Calruz had gotten a rare Skill as a Level 11 [Pet Owner]. He hadn’t expected to level so fast, but all he did in his cell was pet them, exercise, speak with Zevara, construct a miniature climbing gym out of scraps for the two rats, sleep, and so on.
[Pet: Best Quality, Refined]. A Skill for the House of Minos’ warriors to be proud of…for rats.
It was ironic, but it fit Calruz perfectly. Let them have a Skill most Minotaurs would be proud to receive. Rhata could drag a ten pound weight around when he tied it to her. 🐀
Dekass was Rhata. He was a simple leader. He did not understand nuance, but he was capable. Calruz even suspected he was better with his sword and shield than Tersk, who handled it less confidently. The Antinium did not seem to realize each warrior had their own best weapon. Or none, in the case of Artur, the [Flag Bearer].
However, Tersk was unto Haldagaz. Calruz’s white-furred little rat would sometimes sit on Calruz’s head, and the Minotaur would read a book to him. He almost thought Haldagaz understood; Rhata just ate while they read. Tersk was like that. Almost. Almost, and Calruz thought they would be warriors of different species, but on the same level.
Tersk was looking at Calruz like Haldagaz, trying to understand. Aware there was something he was missing. His mandibles clicked slowly.
“It…the appearance of an Aberration means they are a defective Worker or Soldier, Calruz. They must die because they will kill everything they see. They are not of the Hives.”
Calruz raised his brows.
“Do you see that Worker killing anyone?”
“He attacked Crusader 51.”
How could they tell them apart? Calruz recognized the sword-wielding Antinium, but the name? Crusader 51. He eyed the Soldier pinning the angry Worker with three more of the others.
“He also bit at me when I tried to take his weapon. But he did not try to kill anyone.”
“Ah, but he will. You are not Antinium, so you are unaware. We must execute the Aberration. The madness can spread.”
Interesting. Dekass was raising his sword, but the Worker thrashed.
“yoU. YoU. sTUPid DEKass. I AM [CruSAdeR]. i FIGhT.”
Calruz saw Dekass recoil and grabbed the Antinium.
“He speaks. This seems less like madness or…it seems more like an out-of-control [Warrior] to me, Tersk. A [Berserker] who has lost control of reason. Not desirable—but not deserving of death.”
Tersk turned to face Calruz.
“That is an interesting…idea, Calruz. However, my Queen’s orders are clear. I must kill any Aberration I see.”
“Do you know it to be an Aberation?”
Tersk was stumped.
“It clearly is one. It has behaved like every other Aberration I have slain.”
Calruz gritted his teeth.
“Yes…but do you know it is an Aberration? Tersk. Is there a way you could be wrong? Because listen to me. This Worker was a survivor of a squad that perished, all but one, yes?”
“Yes…we rotated them into Squad 5.”
The Antinium was very hesitant. Crusader 57 had gone still as Calruz tried to drip-feed Tersk an idea.
“Perhaps it is not an Aberration. Perhaps, if you are not perfectly certain, the honorable thing would be to let Crusader 57 be.”
“Why?”
Dekass laughed, a fluttering sound. Tersk was frowning at Calruz, his mandibles drooping. Calruz looked around. All the other Antinium were watching him.
