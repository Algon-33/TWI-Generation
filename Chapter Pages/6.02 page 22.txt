“Guardsmen, lower your blades. Clearly you were called here in error. I see no Goblin.”
The City Watch looked at him. Uncertainly, they lowered their arms. Zevara looked at Ilvriss, heart pounding. Numbtongue stared at the Wall Lord. Ilvriss turned.
“This is clearly a mistake. Watch Captain Zevara, if you disperse the crowds, then—”
He broke off as Numbtongue walked towards him. Ilvriss turned back, and he instinctively reached for the hilt of his sword. Numbtongue walked up to Ilvriss. He and the Wall Lord were nearly of a height. The Hobgoblin stared at the Drake.
“Do you see me?”
“What?”
“Do you see me?”
Numbtongue repeated himself, insistently. Ilvriss blinked. Numbtongue raised his voice.
“I’m here. What did I do?”
The Drake’s eyes flickered. He half-turned to looked around. Numbtongue walked in front of him.
“I’m right here. Can you see me?”
Silence. Ilvriss looked at Numbtongue. Then he nodded slowly.
“I see you.”
“What did I do?”
It was the same question. Zevara heard only silence. She bit her tongue. Numbtongue looked around, lost. Then someone answered him.
“You’re a monster. You were born. That’s what you did.”
Relc looked up. His scales were pale. He leaned on his spear. Numbtongue looked at him. The [Spearmaster] looked at him, meeting his eyes. At last, Numbtongue nodded.
“Then monsters saved your city.”
“They did.”
That was all they said. Numbtongue walked past Relc. The City guards began to raise their weapons. But they looked at Zevara and Ilvriss as they did. And neither Drake moved. So instead, the City Watch stood aside.
Numbtongue walked past them. Stumbling. The citizens drew back, some in fear. Others just staring. And for once, they noticed how thin he was. They took in the scar on his chest, leaking blood. They saw his tears. And they parted.
“We should—”
Zevara got no further. Erin followed Numbtongue. She was still crying. Olesm followed her. Ilvriss turned to Zevara. He didn’t say anything. Then he walked away. Zevara hesitated. Then she waved. Slowly, she began to follow Numbtongue and Erin. It was a bright spring day. Noisy in the rest of the city, as people went about their daily lives. But as the Goblin and the Human walked through the city, it grew quiet.

“Goblin.”
It was a refrain that echoed through the city. People on the streets panicked. Some grabbed weapons. Others fled. Zevara’s City Watch spread out ahead of Numbtongue, stopping people from doing either. The Hobgoblin stumbled as he looked around.
In another direction, Erin walked. Drakes and Gnolls stopped and stared at her as she passed. And whatever mood they had changed upon seeing her. Erin walked towards the Hive.
“It’s a monster. You’re the City Watch! Do your job!”
Lism hissed at Zevara. Numbtongue stared at him, and then at the stalls. He walked past them, wandering from place to place. Every so often he would stop.
“What’s that?”
“A tavern.”
“What’s that?”
“A butcher’s.”
Someone had to explain to him what all these places were. Numbtongue knew some of the names, but not why. A place to cut up meat. A place to drink a certain type of drink. He came to a large building.
“What’s that?”
“A public bath house.”
He had no idea what that was. So he went inside. The day manager panicked when he saw Numbtongue walking past the steaming pools of hot water. He fought his way over to Zevara.
“You have to take him out!”
“He’s looking around.”
“Yes, but if a Goblin enters the baths, we’ll have to drain the entire thing!”
“Why?”
“It’s a Goblin.”
