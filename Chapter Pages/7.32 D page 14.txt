“We knew about Earth! Or rather…Seborn did. Moore picked up some stuff with Mrsha. We have ears. And Erin’s not exactly a secret person. But tell us everything.”
Ulinde did. Jelaqua contracted on herself in shock.
“No way. Another planet? We thought it was another dimension! A gateway. Erin and the others?”
“That’s right. The Minds must not know, though. Jelaqua, I have orders from an ‘Idis’ to get us in touch with Joseph.”
“That kid with the soccer ball? Why?”
“They know he’s from Earth.”
Jelaqua went still. She was thinking hard.
“…So they have no idea about Erin?”
“None. Should I tell them—?”
“No.”
Jelaqua’s voice echoed throughout the body. Ulinde flinched. She didn’t ‘see’ Jelaqua; Selphids didn’t see without eyes. But she had senses beyond that of a body. And Jelaqua undulated darkly.
“The Minds…don’t need to know about Erin. If they want Joseph—fine. I’ll respect their wishes. But we’re calling Seborn and Moore in here and telling them.”
Ulinde gasped. Again—another parallel. She exuded a tiny bubble of oxygen which both Selphids sensed.
“But Jelaqua, the orders are secret—”
Jelaqua poked Ulinde. That was…broadly speaking the same.
“We don’t keep secrets from teammates. That’s how Garen…no. Not even the Mind’s orders. Not about Erin. You’re loyal to our people, Ulinde. But you need to learn about what being loyal to your team means.”
“Yes, Jelaqua.”

In short order, the other two Halfseekers were brought in. They listened. They debated. Seborn didn’t like it. Moore didn’t like it. But Jelaqua was adamant.
“Lads—you don’t know the Minds. We’re both Selphids; disobeying them is like disobeying your [Captain], Seborn.”
“I did that all the time. I abandoned my ship, Jelaqua.”
The Drowned Man [Rogue] and former [Pirate] growled. The Selphid hesitated.
“…Okay, not like that. It’s like…betraying your team. There’s no going back for us, boys. And the Minds know about Joseph and Earth.”
She looked around significantly. Moore and Seborn went still. Ulinde went quiet. She shivered, though her body felt no cold. She was in the presence of history. A name unspoken.
Garen Redfang.
“What will you do, Jelaqua? If it puts Erin and Mrsha and the inn in danger, I will not have it. They have been through enough.”
Moore rumbled. Jelaqua nodded at him.
“Nothing like that. I…don’t think the Minds know about Erin. And we’ll keep it that way. I propose we go to the inn. And tell Erin about it.”
The other Halfseekers looked at each other. Ulinde held her breath. Jelaqua went on.
“It’s the right thing to do. She’s managing the kids, and Montressa, Beza, and that Palt are all there to watch her. We go there, tell her what’s up, and let her decide. Votes?”
The Halfseekers voted. On big things like this, they would. Moore nodded, relief on his face. Seborn raised his claw hand.
“Do it. And if they want us to kidnap Joseph or anyone else, tell them to shove off.”
The other three looked at Ulinde. She blinked.
“Me? But I’m new.”
“The Halfseekers don’t care. What do you say, Ulinde?”
Jelaqua smiled at her. The [Spellslinger] felt warm. Connected to her team. She reached out and slowly grasped the wand at her side. She raised it, and sent a bubble of light floating into the air. It floated upwards, reflecting the faces of her team within. Her team. The [Spellslinger] took a deep, shuddering breath.
“I say—I stand with my team. No matter what the Minds want. Let’s find out, shall we?”
