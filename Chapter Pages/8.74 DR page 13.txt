Not like the aura of steel, but…walls? She could almost see them. The walls of an inn on his armor and body. He charged Merila, and she brought her sword down.
The walls broke. The strength of an inn…
Was not enough against the strength of the Dame of the Hills. He tried to block her, and her blow caved in the earth. The [Knight] ran, arm limp.
“Rabbiteater! Dodge!”
Meisa was shouting, hands cupped to her mouth. The Order of Seasons howled at Rabbiteater as he brought his axe down and chopped into Merila’s big toe. Howling, the [Knight] grabbed him with a gauntleted hand.
“No—”
She threw him into the broken archway over the gates so hard he cracked the sooty stone and fell down. He did not rise.
Everyone waited, including Merila, who poured a potion on her severed toe, wincing as it joined. They waited for Ser Solstice to get up, his Aura of Bravery blazing, counter-levelling…
A minute passed. Then another ten seconds, and everyone realized—
He was downed.
“Forwards! Take the keep! Dame Merila has won!”
A [Knight] of Ailendamus shouted. The Order of Seasons and defenders jerked upright.
He’d lost? Before a charge could begin, someone roared.
“Challenge! I challenge you!”
The [Knights] slowed and cursed as Dame Talia surged down the battlements. She leapt onto a horse and rode out. Grimly, Merila turned, but a Drell [Knight] lifted his hand.
“I am Ser Yonst of the Order of Drell! I accept your challenge!”
The delaying tactic was working again! Right up until another [Knight] rode forwards.
“I am of the Order of the Thirsting Veil, Dame Fewq! I challenge you, madam!”
She pointed at Meisa. Seraphel saw the [Spring Knight] hesitate, look at Rabbiteater, then grimly don her helm.
“Markus, get—”
“I challenge you!”
Seraphel saw more [Knights] approaching. This time Markus jerked, and she realized…Rabbiteater’s ploy had failed.
Hidebound and traditionalists the [Knights] may be, but they still adapted. Every [Knight] of the Order of Seasons on the walls saw a counterpart ride up from Ailendamus’ army. The Dame of the Hills stood back as over a hundred duels began. The winners would face another foe…and another…
They were not Rabbiteater. Markus tried to fight with his fists.
He beat two [Knights]. Then he was taken prisoner.
All the while, Rabbiteater just lay there. Within less than thirty minutes, every Order of Seasons [Knight] was defeated, having lost to their opponents.
Dame Talia was last to yield, a blade at her throat. No less than four opponents she’d bested with her sword, but summer was over. And fall…Ser Ilm was knocked unconscious as he tried to cast a spell against a Hydra Knight.
“We offer you a chance to surrender! If not—we will regretfully attack, Your Highnesses.”
The [General] of Ailendamus rode forwards as the Order of Seasons was dragged from the field. The [Fortress Keeper] turned to Aielef, but after no response came, he shouted back.
“We will not surrender! Do your worst!”
The [General of the Line] exhaled grimly.
“Very well.”
The Greatbows opened up less than a minute later. Seraphel saw a [Soldier] vanish in an anguished cry. The [Princesses] looked up and realized the attack was coming.
“Archers! Take the keep!”
Suddenly, the [Knights] were charging! They peeled off as arrows and the spears held them off, and Ailendamus’ crossbows and bows were volleying the walls.
“Get to safety! [Princesses]—”
“It’s over!”
Aielef wailed as the genteel battle of [Knights] turned into sudden, harrowing bloodshed. Seraphel just stared down at Rabbiteater.
