Wistram Days (Pt. 4)
Page 39
 
Wistram was quiet the day after the exams. Most students and mages were too hungover to do anything, and the ones who weren’t suffering were disinclined to do anything when making loud noises could get half a dozen spells cast at your face. Thus, it was only a few mages who gathered outside to practice their spells by the ocean.
Illphres was raising pillars of ice and shattering them with the [Glacial Spear] spell when Ceria found her. The half-Elf panted as she raised a hand to touch Illphres.
“Miss Illphres—”
The woman turned faster than Ceria had ever seen her and stopped Ceria.
“Do not touch me. What is it?”
“Please, come with me.”
“Why?”
Illphres stared expressionlessly at Ceria. The half-Elf knew she was disheveled, hair mussed, and she knew she was grimy and still damp to boot. She tried to explain.
“I did it. I did it. I got rid of the ice just like you said so can you come and see? So I can show you? The ice?”
For a second Illphres just stared at Ceria, but then she nodded.
“Very well. Show me.”
