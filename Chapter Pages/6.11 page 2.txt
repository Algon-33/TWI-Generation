At last, Calruz looked around. He stared at Ceria as she pulled out a Gnoll treat—a salted fish packed with a meaty paste. It lasted quite a while before going bad and it actually tasted pretty good. The Minotaur eyed the snack and shook his head.
“The guards won’t let you give that to me. They make the cell’s field permeable to feed me, but only then. You can’t pass it through.”
The half-Elf stared at the Minotaur.
“Who said anything about you? This is for me.”
She bit into her meal. Calruz stared at her. She knew he probably got prison rations, which again, weren’t as bad as you might get in a prison in Terandria. But hardly tasty food. She saw his cheek twitch. Then he barked a short bit of laughter.
“You always were a pest. I can’t imagine how your new team puts up with you.”
“Go rot your face. I’m a great leader.”
The Minotaur chuckled, the first sound of amusement she’d heard from him.
“If Gerial could see you now—”
He paused, broke off. The amusement flooding his face grew bleak in a moment. Ceria felt the fish snack in her mouth grow less appetizing. She stopped chewing. Swallowed. Calruz stared ahead, breathing slowly.
“Say their names.”
“I remember.”
“Say them.”
A shuddering breath. The Minotaur spoke harshly.
“Gerial. Hunt. Terr. Coblat. Grimsore. Sostrom. Barr.”
Ceria nodded. After that, there was nothing to say. She put the rest of her snack in her belt pouch. Someone moaned across the prison. A late-night reveler waking up and regretting. Probably the drunk Relc had brought in with a huge lump on his head.
It was early morning. Just past dawn, really. Ceria knew that, and she knew she couldn’t stay. Not that she ever did.
“I’m going to leave. We have to take care of that Ashfire Bee nest.”
“Be safe.”
“Yeah, whatever. I’ll have the other Gold-rank teams with me. At least Falene, anyways. I’ll be back tomorrow. Look, if you need more parchment, or some new quills, you could do some sketches of—”
“Don’t bother. I’m not going to be here much longer.”
Calruz looked up. He met Ceria’s eyes again.
“They’re going to execute me. I know Drake law. I deserve it, Springwalker.”
“I—know that. What, did you think I’d try to help you out with that?”
No reply. Calruz just met Ceria’s eyes. She turned away. The Minotaur spoke quietly, illuminated by the magical runes surrounding his cell.
“Better to die sane than down there, like a monster.”
She closed her eyes.
“Tell me it wasn’t your fault.”
No reply. She turned.
“Say it. You’re different now. Down there, it was a spell. The water. Or—”
“I can still hear the voices sometimes. I did it. And there was no reaction when they tested me. No magic. It was just me.”
Calruz shook his head. He stopped sitting against the wall. He stood up and faced Ceria.
“It was me.”
His hand pressed flat against the invisible wall in the air. Ceria looked at him. She turned. She couldn’t say anything. Why couldn’t he lie?
She was walking away when Calruz called out after her.
“Olesm.”
Ceria turned. The Minotaur was staring at her, a frown on his face. He spoke haltingly.
“There was…he was with us, wasn’t he? A part of our team. I forgot his name. What happened to him? I thought you said—when we were below. What of him?”
The half-Elf stared. Calruz was frowning. He still couldn’t remember everything of what had happened below. She forced herself to smile.
“Olesm? He made it. I told you. He’s not adventuring anymore. But he’s fine. Yeah. I think he’s…fine. I’m going to go. But I’ll be back tomorrow.”
“Farewell.”
