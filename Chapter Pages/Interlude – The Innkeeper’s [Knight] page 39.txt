Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 39
Yes, Rabbiteater. That was the thing that had hung over her. In this day of weird failed courtships, something had become plain to Erin.
Why—was she spending her time looking for something she didn’t need? That she might want now and then—when something mattered more?
“Altestiel. Thanks for your help. I’m sorry I…well, sorry it didn’t work out.”
“It was doomed from the start.”
The Earl looked up and the [Innkeeper] nodded. She looked around the inn.
“If there’s anyone else who wants to court me—you can try. But I’m not really interested. If I was—wouldn’t I court you?”
Her audience looked at each other. Lasica rolled her eyes. Erin went on.
“I’m just busy. That’s all. I have friends. Great friends.”
“Oh boy, she’s going to do the glory speech.”
A voice from the back. It sounded like Menolit. Erin laughed. But the tingling in her head…it felt like a ringing bell.
[Dangersense]? But she instinctively sensed…it wasn’t her in danger. Altestiel glanced up, frowning. Erin inhaled.
“Yeah. Something like that. But—it’s so hard to keep them safe. I can while it’s my inn. But it’s so hard out of it. And I’m not cool with that. I’d like to protect them everywhere. Even if it’s impossible, I want to.”
She clenched a fist. Palt stopped smoking. Mrsha’s leg began to jitter on the table as Lyonette held her. The Gnoll’s ears perked up.
“I won’t remain the same forever. Nor will I ever let them die. If I have to struggle—and beg every favor in the world, I won’t let them go. No matter how far you go.”
Lyonette hesitated. She glanced at Mrsha.
“Dear, stop that.”
The plate of fries was jittering slightly. Lyonette saw the glass of water trembling. She looked at Mrsha. Wait a moment. The Gnoll wasn’t even touching the…
“Erin?”
Altestiel rose. The [Innkeeper] was breathing in and out. Numbtongue, frowning, felt the wall.
“What in the name of Nagas—”
Hexel shot out of the hallway in alarm. He looked around.
“The entire inn is vibrating! Is it an earthquake?”
Then he saw Erin Solstice. Her brows were creased. She was concentrating. So hard she nearly burst a blood vessel. She was straining—
“What are you doing, Erin?”
Selys murmured from the side. The [Innkeeper] closed her eyes.
“I saw them all doing it. It’s a clever trick. If they can do it, why can’t I? I just didn’t know how it worked.”
Worked? Numbtongue glanced at Badarrow.
“This might be dangerous. Trying to force a Skill is—”
Altestiel was knocked over by the two Hobgoblins. They surged forwards, Snapjaw behind them. Hovering around Erin. She reached out and grabbed their wrists.
“I don’t need to see anything. Distance is just…”

They were prying at the helmet. The bear-[General] had dented it such that it was hard to open. But they were slowly prising it off him.
Rabbiteater was distracted. He was waiting. But he felt it. A pressure in his head. Painful.
“What—what—”
“Don’t hurt him. The General will have our heads!”
“We’re not! He’s just complaining to trick us. Hurry up!”
Perhaps they felt it. The three men strained. And the Goblin tensed. The others were holding him fast. But he felt like—a familiar hand was reaching for him. It felt like—
“Erin?”

Her nose began bleeding. Not a cool nosebleed either. Both nostrils. Altestiel made a sound.
“You’re pushing too hard! Stop!”
She ignored him. It felt like—a barrier that was deforming in her head. Like it was made of plastic. She pushed harder.
Why? She looked at the two Goblins. Around the inn. She pointed at the sign.
