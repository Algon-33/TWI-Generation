Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 4
Technically, that was all the [Captain] had sent the naval team to do—and perhaps get a sword and shield as a trophy. But the [First Mate] felt the navy’s pride had been stung. He glowered and put a tiny bit of that into his voice.
“General Yerzhen, I feel that given the escape attempt, you should take more precautions—”
“Precautions? I’m the one who has to ransom the bastards! Go hop on your boat and row off!”
“The Fleet of Ailendamus will not be disrespected—”
The [First Mate] had a hand on the shortsword he carried, ignoring the risk and his nervous company. He ducked as Yerzhen hurled his entire bottle of wine at him. The [Sailors] saw the [General] whirl and backed up, leaving their officer to face the man’s wrath as he strode across the tent, bellowing.
“Lance-arrows take your damned fleet! You’re the bastards who caused trouble for me! His Majesty’s so wroth with me, he has us guarding prisoners and toadying about! All because one of your salt-for-brains [Admirals] went and attacked Nadel and gave away our war plan!”
He prodded the [First Mate] so hard the man staggered. Suddenly, the pieces fit and the officer paled.
This was General Yerzhen, who’d been implicated and then cleared in the disastrous attack on the Lord of the Dance. Foreign saboteurs had orchestrated the entire thing, but the [Admiral] had been relieved of command.
And the man who’d been impersonated, who had in fact been in the right spot. Ready to attack Calanfer until the plan had been leaked?
Yerzhen of Ailendamus. Or, as some called him, Yerzhen, the Bear. The Bear-General of Ailendamus, who could bend steel with his hands.
“What’s his name? Admiral Deckless? I’ll rip his head off if I ever meet him…he on your ship?”
“N-no, General. I apologize for—”
“We’ll ransom your prisoners. They want to escape? They can get past me, a [General] of Ailendamus. Think that’s likely? No? Then get out.”
Yerzhen was in a terrible mood. He saw the naval crew make a swift retreat. The [General] went back to his drink, pulling out a bottle of gin this time. But no amount of alcohol could cover the disgrace he was in. And it wasn’t his fault! He’d done everything perfectly. If he ever found out who’d impersonated him…
His hands clenched and unclenched as he strode around his war tent. The mood in his camp was equally despondent. The rough and ready ‘Bear Brawlers’ as they were affectionately known were a seasoned group, not as professional as some groups, but experienced. Sidelined because their [General] was in disgrace.
[Illusionists] could be terribly cruel.

At the same time, in Liscor, a group of children were playing a war game of their own. Children played games, across every species.
And they tended to take from real life. So in this case, instead of being [Soldiers], they were the Watch.
‘Guards’ would have to fight bad guys, who used to be just ‘Humans’, but were now more nuanced. Sometimes they were monsters, other times, evil [Necromancers].
The game was very complex. If a [Necromancer] killed a [Guard], for instance, the [Guard] became a Zombie. Or a Draug—but that was often cheating.
[Mages] got to cast spells, and adventurers got to play too. There were about thirty children, running about the inn.
