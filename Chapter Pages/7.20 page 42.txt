All three [Ladies] looked down. A white Gnoll stared up at them, blinking. Wuvren blinked. And her intoxicating charm turned into genuine delight. Erin blinked. She looked like she was in her thirties now. Not the young woman who had just been there a moment ago.
“Oh, what a beautiful child!”
Mrsha bashfully retreated. No one had ever called her beautiful before. Lady Magnolia smiled.
“Wuvren, you’ll have more time to spoil Gnoll children later. We are on a timer. But—ah, hello!”
A claw pushed a staring Temile and half a dozen [Actors] out of the way. Grimalkin looked at Magnolia Reinhart.
“Lady Reinhart. I am Grimalkin of Pallass.”
“Ah, [Sinew Magus]! How delightful. I was hoping to meet with you—briefly. Do excuse me for my sudden interruption. I won’t be troubling the inn long. Reynold? Where’s our guest?”
Magnolia smiled. Grimalkin gazed at her, and flicked his eyes towards Ressa. She was watching him, as well as looking around the room.
“Lady Reinhart. Your presence in Liscor is exactly what I should have been prepared for. May I respectfully ask that you return to your door until I notify Pallass’ High Command?”
“You may.”
Magnolia didn’t budge. Grimalkin’s brows drew together.
“I’m afraid I must insist.”
He reached out. Ressa barred his path. And so did—Pryde. She sized up the giant Drake.
“You are the largest Drake I’ve met. I am Pryde. And one does not insist anything of me. Kindly step back.”
“I’m afraid I cannot do that. Lady Pryde.”
Grimalkin reached for her shoulder. And his claw jerked downwards. Pryde smiled coolly.
“Allow me to rephrase myself. You cannot insist.”
[Pride is Weight]. Grimalkin’s muscles bulged and the [Sinew Magus] withdrew his hand with a grimace.
“Gravity Skill. I would prefer to keep this civil. Whatever you are planning—I—am—here.”
He reached out. At first his hand jerked as Pryde’s aura dragged it down. Then Erin saw the scales and flesh twist. But Grimalkin murmured.
“[Lion’s Strength]. [Stoneskin]—”
Half a dozen spells. He reached out and Erin swore she heard his bones creaking. Lightly, he moved Pryde back a step.
She blinked. Wuvren and Magnolia watched. Magnolia smiled and Wuvren laughed in delight. Pryde glanced at Grimalkin’s arm.
“Not bad. But you cannot stop—”
“Pryde, don’t antagonize Magus Grimalkin. And Magus—we aren’t here for any action that would harm Pallass or Liscor. I would swear on a truth spell. In fact, if you have one…”
The Drake flicked his gaze to Magnolia.
“Nevertheless, I cannot—”
“Oh, you. Please allow us just a moment.”
Wuvren sighed. She blew a kiss. Erin swore she saw something flying at Grimalkin. The [Sinew Magus] jerked back. Too late. He blinked. Stepped back, and bowed slightly. And his voice was suddenly polite, formal.
“Of course. My apologies, Lady Wuvren.”
Wuvren laughed and patted him on one arm.
“I do apologize, but it really is in the best of all our interests. We are bound by hospitality’s rules. Pryde?”
“Grimalkin. Hmf.”
The [Lady] walked past Grimalkin. The [Sinew Magus] stood there, calmly. Then his jaw began to twitch. Erin saw something pulsing at his temple.
“Damn. Formality Skills—”
He turned his head slowly.
“Stop them. Warn Saliss. Chaldion—no, wait. I can do that. Just not interfere—”
He put a claw to his temple, and his eyes flickered. Erin looked at Magnolia. She was arguing with someone on Invrisil’s side.
“Reynold, what’s the hold up?”
“He was beating a man with his staff. Lady Reinhart—”
“For what? Abusing his dog? Well then, arrest the fellow and we’ll sort it out later. Nalthaliarstrelous, I told you—”
“I’m coming.”
