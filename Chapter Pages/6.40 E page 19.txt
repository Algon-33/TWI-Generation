Especially a [Witch]. Ryoka wasn’t sure if they could be trusted—no, she was pretty sure at least one of them spelled trouble for Riverfarm. This entire scenario smelled fishy to her. A Circle of Thorns? This traitor who’d manipulated Laken into attacking the Goblins? Durene had told Ryoka about that last night and Ryoka was already trying to figure out who it was. It had to be—
“Hey you two! What’s the hold up?”
Charlay came galloping back, wiping water from her mouth. She glared at Ryoka and Durene and then grabbed at her midriff.
“Ooh! My stomach! I think I’ve got colic! I shouldn’t have drank that water so quickly!”
“Don’t joke about that.”
Ryoka sighed at Charlay. The Centauress laughed. Durene blinked.
“You mean, like horses? Can a Centauress get that?”
“Hey! Anyone can get colic! Don’t be racist! Speciesist!”
Charlay glared at Durene. Abashed, the half-Troll girl turned red. Ryoka glared and kicked Charlay gently on one leg. The Centauress raised one of hers and Ryoka backed up. She hesitated and saw Durene’s face.
“I didn’t mean you’re super-racist. It’s fine! It’s fine! Besides, we’re both non-Human, right? Humans are the really racist ones. We should be pals!”
She trotted over and slapped Durene on the shoulder. Then she squinted at Durene.
“I didn’t ask, but you’re—are you a Troll? I’ve seen some as mercenaries on Baleros. You know, in monstrous regiments?”
Durene’s head shot up. She stared at Charlay, open-mouthed. Ryoka coughed.
“Charlay.”
“What? Oh, am I being ‘insensitive’ again, Ryoka? Wait, am I?”
Charlay rolled her eyes and then glanced anxiously back at Durene. The girl shook  her head.
“I’m—half-Troll.”
“Oh. Hey! I haven’t seen any of those—I mean, people like you. But that’s cool. Half-Troll. Half-Troll. Does that mean a Troll and—”
“You say you knew Trolls in Baleros, Charlay?”
Ryoka interrupted quickly. The Centauress nodded casually.
“Yup. Monster regiments. They don’t level and a lot of them are really stup—I mean, they don’t level up, but sometimes tribes ally with mercenary companies or enlist. It’s rare and Goblins are banned from that kind of thing, but it used to happen. Of course, usually we go to war with them. Hey, do you know Fleethoof? She’s a famous Centauress and she fought a bunch of Ogres and nasty Cyclopes and um…”
She stared at Durene. The girl stared back. Charlay looked around and Ryoka massaged her eyes. The Centauress turned around.
“Hey! Let’s look at those fields, huh?”
She took off. Ryoka glared at her galloping figure as she raced away and turned to Durene.
“Sorry. Charlay’s insensitive.”
“It’s fine. I didn’t know Trolls could live anywhere with people in peace. I thought they just attacked everything on sight.”
Durene looked wistfully after Charlay. Ryoka cleared her throat.
“So. Uh—Riverfarm. I see its busy building. Lots of new people. What do you do all day?”
The half-Troll girl started. She kept walking with Ryoka and shrugged.
“Me? I just woke up a little bit ago. I help out, but ever since the army was pretty much disbanded…I don’t know. I wish I did. I wish Laken were here.”
Ryoka nodded absently.
“Aren’t you a [Paladin], though? Laken said he made you into one.”
“Yup.”
Ryoka hesitated and eyed Durene.
“So…don’t you have an urge to do [Paladin] things? Go on crusades? Fight evil?”
“No? Where would I find any? And I’m not a [Knight]!”
Durene laughed at the idea. Ryoka hesitated.
“Yes, but…”
She broke off as they reached the river and fields. Ryoka blinked, and then stared. Durene pointed proudly at the farmland that stretched far as Ryoka could see across the other bank.
