“You can put it down. Give me that.”
Salkis grabbed at the phone. The Goblin refused to give it over. The Soldier shook him, mildly.
“Thanks. Just give him to me and I’ll hit him until he gives me that. Hey, which Soldier is…?”
Salkis hesitated, lowering her voice since she remembered they had the Gnoll guests. She pointed at him as Bird rode forwards. The Worker tilted his head and he looked at the Soldier with no name.
The little man in the hat was there too. Bird tilted his head, left and right.
“I do not know. This is a Soldier.”
“Yes, but what’s his name?”
Bird answered after a second.
“…He has none. He is not Painted Antinium. Nor is he anyone I know. Hello, you.”
The Soldier nodded. This was so. Sergeant Gna blinked and Salkis and even the Goblin thief squirming in his grip stared at him.
“What, no name? He’s one of the faceless bug b—the Soldiers?”
“That is so.”
Bird looked at the Soldier again. He tilted his head.
“A strong bug. He has the most highest levels of any Antinium here in fighting. Except for me.”
Grammar aside, this was also true. Salkis and Gna blinked. After a second, Salkis reached out and tried to prise the phone free of the little Goblin’s grip. He opened his mouth and she yanked her hand back. She made a fist—saw the others watching, and lowered it.
“You. Give.”
Badarrow rode over and snapped. The Goblin gave up the iPhone sulkily, and Salkis sighed.
“Thanks. Uh—you.”
She nodded at the Soldier. He nodded slowly. Gna glanced at him.
“That’s just like you Antinium. People should have names, you know.”
She half-addressed Bird, muttering. The [Bird Hunter] tilted his head.
“He can choose a name if he wishes. But he was not inducted into the Painted Antinium. Pawn could have done that.”
“What, doesn’t that make you lot stronger? If you’re on a suicide mission, you probably should.”
“Mm. Yes. Too late now. We don’t even have any paint.”
Ulvama raised her head slightly. Gna waved a paw.
“Yeah, or that weird Pawn-bug.”
“No, he is not necessary. I think.”
Gna turned back to Bird.
“What? What do you need for these, uh, Painted ants?”
Her eyes sharpened and the Soldier knew she was going to write down whatever Bird told her. On a strategic level…
He said nothing. No one asked him anything. To which the little man in the hat would have said, ‘that was the problem’. Sometimes you needed to…
Bird was counting on his fingers.
“Let me think. It is a complex ritual of the Free Antinium, the first of its kind. First you need an Antinium that has not been painted. Then you need paint. And then you need…”
He stared at his third finger. He lowered it.
“…A brush is optional.”
Sergeant Gna and Salkis—even Badarrow—gave Bird a slightly slack-jawed look. Gna hesitated, hand on her notepad.
“You’re messing with me. I thought that makes Antinium stronger. Individuals, or something.”
Bird smiled happily.
“It does. I mean…maybe. I am a [Liar].”
He waved all four arms. Gna looked around, at the Soldier, the other Painted Antinium like Touma the Great…
“Really? That’s it? Then give this Antinium some paint. I mean—just so we can tell him apart. And a damn name. If we’re going to be travelling with him.”
She folded her arms, caught herself, and glared at everyone with as much hostility as she could muster.
“I don’t care. I hope you all get shanked. But if I have to ride with you…”
Badarrow rode over. He put an arm around Gna’s shoulder—or tried to as she flinched away.
“You do care. Friend.”
“Gah! Stop it! I’m not—”
