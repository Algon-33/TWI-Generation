A cluster of [Knights] vanished as the Greatbows tracked them and loosed. Another group ran into walls of magic. They hacked at the shields, and then found themselves boxed in. They went down fighting.
However, too many [Knights] were pushing in. The first ones reached the ranks of archers at last. The bowmen and women looked up as the first angry [Knight] came at them, whirling a bloody sword.
Their nerve broke. They began to run.
“Hold your ground!”
Vexil tried to use his Skill again; if they stopped battering the [Knights], all was lost! He wasn’t able to, but one of the [Strategists] shouted.
“[Restore Courage]!”
The [Archers] turned, and to Vexil’s relief, began loosing arrows point-blank. The [Knight] went down as some attacked with shortswords. He mopped sweat from his forehead, panting. The damned rain made it hard to see; ironically the same rain he had hoped to weaken their auras with was now making aiming the Greatbows difficult.
“Shoot the Summer’s Champion! I don’t care if our [Knights] are in the way!”
He snapped at the [Strategist]. The man paled.
“But, General—”
“I will take responsibility!”
“Sir, we can barely tell where the Summer’s Champion is!”
Vexil swung around. Had they lost sight of that [Knight]? Impossible! He was—
Where? The [General] swung his spyglass around. That was when he realized something.
The rain. The rain had become…thick. It was getting hard to see. The downpour was one thing, but why…? Vexil lowered the spyglass, wiped at the front. Was that condensation?
No, he realized. It was…mist. Steam?
Steam was rising from the battlefield. Vexil saw the [Summer Knights] fighting, the glow of their aura-weapons few and far between. Most weren’t using visible weapons; only the Summer’s Champion, Voost, and Wildfire’s Wrath. But he’d heard they were aura-specialists. So…where was their aura going?
The battlefield. Steam was rising everywhere. Suddenly, Vexil felt at his brow and realized the sweat coming from his forehead wasn’t entirely due to fear. It was hot.
And it was getting hotter.

The first inkling Rabbiteater had was when a [Soldier] stumbled and cursed before Rabbiteater struck him down. The man looked—unwell. He’d been clawing at his head. Why?
Rabbiteater thought it was just a random thing. Like a wasp landing inside your helmet; ill luck on the battlefield. However, he realized…more and more [Soldiers] were faltering.
They were getting tired, even before they clashed with the [Summer Knights]. It grew even more apparent after the fourth charge. Rabbiteater saw a man drop his sword, crying out. Rabbiteater swung his sword down, and then stared at the…smoke…rising from the dead man’s armor.
It was then he heard the screams and realized the rain wasn’t hitting him anymore. Rabbiteater looked up.
It was still raining, but the rain wasn’t even reaching the ground anymore. Steam rose in huge clouds. And that was higher up.
On the ground, a [Soldier] clawed at her helmet. It had begun to glow slightly, and she screamed, tossing away the burning piece of metal. In fact—Rabbiteater remembered Greysten handing him the amulet.
He looked down at it and saw a sigil that looked like a burning flame on the ruby. The Goblin raised it and realized what it was.
Amulet of Fire Resistance. He looked around and saw Ailendamus’ army devolving into chaos.
“Hold your ground! Hold—”
A [Captain] screamed at her men. But they couldn’t even hold onto their weapons.
“My armor is burning! I can’t—”
