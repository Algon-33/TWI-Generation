“Don’t take it personally! I know I made fun of you a bit. But I do that all the time with my Centaur friends. In…Baleros. I guess it’s different here.”
She hesitated. And Ryoka realized that Centaurs really were different. Like any other culture, really. She wondered if anyone else had realized that. Slowly, Ryoka smiled and shook her head, pretending not to notice Charlay’s anxious look.
“Hey, I don’t mind. Just don’t do it all the time. You know how thin-skinned we Humans are.”
“Yeah, and touchy. But insulting each other is what friends do. We are friends, aren’t we?”
Charlay’s question took Ryoka off guard. But then Ryoka nodded. And Charlay’s smile provoked one of Ryoka’s as well. Without a word, the Centauress trotted forwards and then into a run.
“Well, that was obvious. Why did you need to spell it out? Come on, Ryoka! Let’s go!”
She beckoned and Ryoka followed. The young woman stared at Charlay’s back as the Centaur laughed, running with all four legs and shook her head, mystified, happy—she looked up towards the sky.
“It’s so easy, Erin. Why didn’t you tell me that? Why didn’t I listen?”
And then she ran off, south. With a new friend. And as they ran towards Riverfarm, Charlay’s voice echoed back towards her.
“…Hey! Do you know if we’re going the right way?”
