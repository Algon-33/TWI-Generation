“Bird. Garry. You both failed that test. Your answers were false. But I will test you a second time. So. Listen. And answer. What is the purpose of the Antinium?”
And the Free Queen waited, the answer in her mind, shouting. And she looked at the two Workers. At Bird especially. And she waited. The two Workers looked at each other. Garry was first.
“Is it to be happy?”
“No. Bird.”
The little Worker stared up at the Queen. She stared back and her antennae quivered. She had thought on this for weeks. And she had not dared test Bird, because of what it might mean. She was afraid. But duty was duty. She did not know if she wanted him to be wrong or right. Bird thought for a long while. Then he answered slowly, haltingly.
“Is it not to eat birds?”
The Free Queen exhaled. The wind ruffled both Worker’s antennae. Relieved, almost relaxed, the Free Queen reached down with one large feeler. Bird made a sound as she lifted him up, cradling him.
“No. You are incorrect. You have failed.”
Bird didn’t react in any particular way to the news. But the words staggered Garry like a blow. He looked down, and then up. He spread all four hands slowly towards the Free Queen.
“My Queen. You ask us a question with many answers but only one true one. May I ask…how should we know the correct answer? Is it something Revalantor Klbkch would know the answer to? He never told us, my Queen.”
“He was never meant to.”
“Then why ask? Is it something we should know?”
“Yes.”
The Free Queen rocked Bird. His mandibles opened in a smile. She half-turned from Garry. He spoke again, hesitantly.
“But how should we know? If we were not told—is it something we should have known from our creation, my Queen?”
The Free Queen hesitated. But the truth didn’t matter to the test. She turned her head back.
“The question does not matter. It is a different one each time. But the answer matters. It must be the same as mine. Do you understand, [Cook] Garry?”
He hesitated and shook his head.
“No, my Queen. I do not understand.”
“Ah. Then look at me, Garry.”
He did. A tiny Worker appeared in the Queen’s gaze. She stared down at him and held the answer in her mind.
“This is the nature of the test. I ask you a question. Any question. And you answer it. What number do I think of, Gary? That is the test. Now. Listen. I am telling you the answer. Can you hear it?”
The Worker listened. He looked up at the Free Queen’s closed mandibles. He looked at Bird. The Worker was staring up at the Free Queen. After a minute, Garry shook his head.
“I am sorry, my Queen. I hear nothing. But you said nothing. How was I supposed to hear it?”
“With this.”
The Free Queen lowered another feeler. Garry flinched as the feeler gently touched his antennae. Then, wonderingly, he reached up to touch it.
“My Queen? But you can hear my thoughts with it. And you can order me. Or—if I concentrated—”
“I can hear you, Garry. With effort. If you project your thoughts as you are ordered. I can even send my will to you. But you cannot hear me. I must be the one who sends to you. Do you understand that?”
Garry slowly nodded. Bird tilted his head.
“We can hear and speak. And you can hear and speak, Queen. But only one of us has a voice and ears?”
“Yes. That is…close, Bird. Garry. Do you understand?”
The Free Queen looked at him. The [Cook] hesitated.
“I think I do, my Queen. Forgive my ignorance.”
“It is a question. I answered. Now you understand why you failed.”
