Pisces looked at her and shook his head. He looked up at the Drake, and rose. Mesiel took a step back. But Pisces looked at the tables around him. His audience. He spoke to them, to the Drake.
“I am sorry about your loss, Mister Mesiel. I am. But yes, the undead are dangerous. And they wish to slay the living, it is true. But I attempt to control them. I cannot speak for other [Necromancers], but I want to understand them. And I am not Az’kerash. I am an adventurer, and a [Mage]. And a [Necromancer]. It is my occupation.”
It wasn’t a perfect speech. Far from it. There were no perfect, elegant words that Pisces wanted to deliver. It wasn’t even the whole truth. But it was the best he could give.
And even so. Mesiel listened to Pisces’ words. He stared into the Human’s face and shook his head slightly.
“Why do you do it? What’s there to be gained in—I could understand [Summoners]. Or making Golems. But undead? Rotting flesh and bone? People?”
Pisces’ shoulders began to hunch, but he straightened them. He met the Drake’s eyes. It was as if they were the only bright things in the world. So hard to meet.
“I attempt not to use people, sir. And I work with bone. It is—a material. To be used in creation.”
That was the wrong thing to say. The Drake jerked back.
“A—but why dead bodies?”
Pisces opened his mouth and hesitated. Say it another way. He spoke slowly, trying not to stumble over his words.
“It’s what I’m good at. I understand it, like a [Bladesman] understands his sword. What do you do for a living, sir?”
“I’m a [Builder]. I work with constructing stuff, fixing, mainly.”
The young man nodded.
“Then I enjoy necromancy as much as you might while swinging a hammer. It may not be a direct comparison, but if you understand passion for your work—the satisfaction of completing a task well—that is what I have towards necromancy.”
The Drake nodded jerkily. He searched Pisces, and then his team. Pisces wondered what Ceria and Yvlon’s faces looked like. The Drake tried again.
“But couldn’t you make golems instead? Why bone? And the undead. Do you enjoy making them into—puppets?”
He was going in circles. So was Pisces. Erin trotted over.
“Okay! Hey! No bothering Pisces, okay?”
The Drake looked at her.
“I just want to know. He’s got a bounty. I read it.”
“It’s false. Wistram made it up. Parts of it.”
Ceria stood up, protectively standing by Pisces. He wished she wouldn’t. The Drake turned back.
“Parts of it are fake? What parts?”
She hesitated.
“The—look. Pisces did some bad stuff. There was an accident at Wistram. People got killed, but it wasn’t exactly—it was an accident. And the [Mages] in Wistram? Montressa and her team? They have a grudge. But—Pisces isn’t—the necrophilia isn’t true.”
The aforementioned Pisces closed his eyes. Erin inhaled her lips. Mesiel just looked at Pisces. And Pisces looked at him. He bowed his head slightly.
“I’m sorry for your loss, Mister Mesiel. But cannot give you what you want. I am a [Necromancer]. But I am not Az’kerash.”
“But why?”
The questioned lingered, even as a Gnoll and Drake came to pull Mesiel back. Pisces met his eyes.
“I’m sorry for your loss.”
It was the most honest answer. The most unfulfilling. The [Necromancer] watched Erin chivvy the others back. He turned. Now, they were all staring at him.
“Damn. What was that? He can’t just—”
Ceria was flustered. She turned. Ksmvr was looking anxiously at her and Pisces. Yvlon just met the [Necromancer]’s eyes. She nodded. So did he.
