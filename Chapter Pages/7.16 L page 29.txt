Anand looked up. Relc shook his head. He stared pensively past Anand.
“Nah. Drakes, Gnolls. Kids. Come to think of it, I was one of ‘em. Lost my family in the Goblin Wars, see. Enlisted—I was just a brat. I could barely hold a spear, but the 4th Company—all of the army, really—took me in. That’s how it works. They’re not perfect. In fact, I left for a reason. But they do take care of you. Come to that—that’s what I never did with Embria.”
He stared past Anand. The Worker looked at him, not really comprehending, but listening. Sensing, perhaps. That it mattered to Relc.
“It was a bad day in Liscor. Well, I’d just quit the army. I was still…young. Embria, I think she missed it. Being part of a big family in Liscor. That’s the thing. There are a lot of boys. Just like you, Anand. In the army. Troublemakers, kids with wild sides, violent—but we straighten ‘em out. We don’t let go of you. Once you’re in the army, you’re family. That’s why they hate it so much when you leave. Feels like betrayal. I guess that’s a problem too.”
The [Sergeant] paused. Anand whispered, looking up, stopping his slow rocking.
“I wish I was part of that army. I would like a family. That is what I wish.”
“Yeah. Well—I’m a bad father myself. My own kid ran off to join the army. Thinks I’m a hero or something, even now. Klb…Klb…I don’t think he gets it. He’s never had one. How’d he take it when you asked him?”
The Worker looked up.
“He said no. I attempted to curry favor. By doing my best to reduce casualties in my daily battles against incursions from the dungeon.”
Relc looked at him.
“You…fight monsters? Every day?”
Anand nodded.
“Yes. That is what my duty is. I am a [Tactician]. I serve the Hive. But not well enough.”
Relc thought of the notepad and his orders. He ignored them.
“Well. It sounds like you work really hard, Anand. Really hard. But you know what? You don’t have to do that. Not to make Klbkch a father.”
“I don’t? How, then?”
The Drake paused. He felt…old. So old, as he looked at a child. Weeping without tears.
“He was always your dad, Anand. Old Klb. He just never admitted to it. But—you know what?”
“What?”
“I’d be proud to have a kid like you as a son. You’re a good kid, Anand. Klbkch just doesn’t know it.”
Relc reached out. He carefully patted Anand on the head, avoiding the antennae. The Worker looked at him.
“I would like to have a father like you, Senior Guardsman Relc.”
“Yeah. Thanks. I wish I was. Tell you what—you ever need to talk, you come to me. Any time. I mean it.”
Relc looked at Anand. The Worker stopped trembling. He saw Relc hold out a hand. Took it, and tried to shake. He was surprised when Relc drew him into a hug with clasped arms, patting him on the back.
“Thank you.”
“Any time. Sorry, I’ve gotta go.”
Relc stood up abruptly. Anand would have given him anything to stay. He looked up.
“Where are you going?”
The Drake paused. He looked at Anand. At Bird, at the inn. The place where green blood had seeped into the floorboards and Ishkr was beginning to mop. He shook his head.
“I wish, Anand, buddy. But you can’t choose your dads. Or maybe you can. But sometimes you get the ones that don’t deserve it. I’ll be back.”
He looked at Anand. The Worker stared back.
“Where are you going?”
The Drake walked towards the doors, his shoulders set.
“To have a chat with Klbkch. Dad to dad.”

“Hey, Klbkch.”
The Antinium was on patrol. Tkrn was uneasily following him. They were passing down the street, having just signed into their shift at the Watch Barracks. The Antinium turned. His voice was flat. Emotionless.
