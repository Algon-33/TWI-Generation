And his arm didn’t move. The group walked past him and the other guards. They had the Skills that [Ladies] had learned, but yet to master. The abilities that [Innkeepers], [Kings], even [Strategists] and [Generals] got—but they were all of their class.
So long as I do no harm, you cannot harm me. Nerul focused on his real opponents. There were three of them.
Old Vidam. Nerul cracked his knuckles and winced.
“Ow.”
“Out the doors—hurry—”
The [Silvertongue Emissary] was trying to force the Drakes down the steps. Nerul smiled.
“Not so fast. Wall Lord Rellmel, we have a negotiation to get to and I insist you [Come to the Table].”
The Wall Lord froze, his hand on the doorknob. He tried to fight—but he wasn’t Ilvriss. He began to pivot when Vidam blocked Nerul’s way.
“[Request Denied]. Lord Rellmel has said his piece and no Skills or unlawful persuasion will force him otherwise!”
The Drake woman tsked. Weressna shook her head as Videl freed Rellmel.
“Oh come on, Vidam. [Think About It].”
“[Exit Negotiations]!”
One of the younger Drakes from the Emera family barked. Nerul raised his brows. No style, no substance. And it was three versus six.
The Drake with scrolls moved at Nerul’s nod.
“[Let’s Make a Deal]. We have vast funds, Lord and Lady of the Walls. You haven’t heard all of what House Gemscale and Lord Ilvriss have to offer.”
“[Clear Minds]! That’s not a valid offer. Wall Lord Rellmel has refused the offers on the table!”
“Let’s [Sweeten the Deal], then.”
Nerul crooned. Vidam was already sweating. He was trying to deny the multiple Skills attacking his clients, but he was outnumbered and outplayed. One of the Drakes croaked.
“[Future Negotiation]. We—we will do this—”
“We will do this now.”
The [Diplomat] broke the Skill in half without even needing to waste his own. The weaker [Negotiator] reeled. Nerul turned to Vidam.
“I was always the better [Diplomat]. I’m afraid this is going to turn into a sit-down, Vidam. Bring whoever you want. But you’re going to lose.”
He turned, wiped the sweat from his brow, and pointed.
“Let’s see. That table will do nicely. Let’s clear the restaurant. Where’s the manager? We’ll need food, scrolls—”
“Provided for.”
“And I’ve talked to the manager.”
Mister Superior emerged from the back room and nodded to Nerul. The Drake grinned. He nodded to the Drake and group he’d told to wait at the doorway. Ilvriss entered the room as the two members of House Emera sat, furious, but helpless, at the negotiation table.
Nerul sat. Oh, they made fun of him. The black sheep of House Gemscale. The white Gnoll, in other parlances. [Diplomat]. What a useless class. What could it do that a [Lord], a [Warrior] could not?
Well, he could pry a potion out of the hands of even the most stubborn Drakes. And all without drawing a weapon. He grinned, cracked his fingers again, winced, and got down to work.

Ilvriss recalled that Erin Solstice had once been furious when Xif the [Alchemist] had forced her to sell one of her faerie flowers. He didn’t recall if he had been there for that, or just heard the news from keeping tabs on Liscor.
Well, Xif had one Skill in Nerul’s field. Nerul had many. And what Xif could do to an [Innkeeper]? A [Negotiator] lived to do this.
…Some of them. The negotiation-raid was a known tactic in Salazsar, who relied on contracts and companies. It beat bloodshed, but it was not employed normally.
It was to aggression what kicking down the door with a group of [Thugs] was. And even if you got what you wanted—
“There will be consequences! We won’t let this lie!”
