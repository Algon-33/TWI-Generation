All of them were there. Wiskeria, Belavierr, Hedag, Califor, Mavika, even Nanette. And they looked down on Alevica. It was dusk. The light cast long shadows on their faces. But their eyes had a luminescence of their own.
“Hold her. Give her strength.”
Eloise ordered the others. And Alevica’s chest seemed to rise and fall only by virtue of the [Witch]’s stares. Nanette’s face was pale. Califor’s eyes focused on Alevica’s face. Hedag leaned on her axe, her eyes blazing.
“Mother. Can you save her?”
Wiskeria never looked away from Belavierr. The Stitch Witch paused. And her voice was heavy with power.
“It is not my strength. Witch Eloise surpasses me in that field. Hold her.”
“We cannot. She is dying.”
The raven on Mavika’s shoulder called once, echoing the [Witch]’s words. Eloise was mixing something, spreading it on Alevica’s stomach. Wiskeria clenched her hands.
“No! No! She can’t die!”
“She is fading. She has lost too much blood.”
“It isn’t right.”
“If we’d been faster—”
Ryoka clutched at her head. She was trying to figure out how to transfuse blood. Tubes? No! She couldn’t cut Alevica. She looked around desperately. A funnel. But she needed to test Alevica’s blood type—
They hadn’t noticed Alevica was gone until in the evening. And then the coven had grown concerned. The older [Witches] had felt…something. And Laken’s [Message] had come at the right moment. He’d found her. But—
“She can’t die. She can’t! We need more power!”
Wiskeria looked around, desperately. Belavierr’s eyes began to glow, and then stopped.
“I have not enough. We are holding her on the edge of life. We need more to pull her back.”
She looked up. Wordlessly, at Ryoka. The City Runner shouted, desperately. She saw people crowded around the house, staring in.
“Take it from me!”
“And me!”
Charlay called from the door. The Centauress’ eyes were wide. Wiskeria looked at them, desperately. Mavika hissed.
“Then give me your passion! Give us feelings! Strong as can be!”
Ryoka looked at Alevica. She was rude, arrogant, she’d burned Charlay’s tale, but she didn’t deserve this—
“I take your desperation.”
“I take your grief.”
“I take your rage.”
Mavika, Belavierr, and Hedag spoke as one. Ryoka felt it go out of her. She stared at Alevica, suddenly blank. A bit empty. The [Witch]’s eyes flickered. Mavika whispered.
“Not enough. More.”
The [Witches] looked to the crowd. And the people shuddered. But Belavierr shouted towards them.
“She’s dying! Someone’s stabbed her! Don’t you feel a thing? Feel something! We’re trying to save her!”
The people heard. And some—some felt what Ryoka had felt and it was taken. But too many just stared. And Ryoka heard the word, unspoken.
[Witch].
They did not care for her. They did not care, truly care if Alevica died. What the crowd saw, what they experienced was…
Helplessness. Just as when they had seen Belavierr facing Ser Raim. Desperate—hope—longing—anger—fear—it wasn’t strong enough. No one emotion. What could sum up the death? The loss? It wasn’t right. But they did not know Alevica. She was a [Witch] and they did not know her. But someone had killed her—
Ryoka could see the [Witches] trying to pull power from the crowd. But they weren’t any one thing. They weren’t afraid. They weren’t angry enough either. It was just horror and pain and loss—but numbed after what they had seen. Wiskeria screamed.
“It’s not enough. Can’t you feel anything? This isn’t right! This isn’t right! Why don’t you care?”
