“You are slave. You hurt own Goblins. You are not real Goblin Lord. Is what other Goblins say.”
There was a cry of outrage from Snapjaw. The Goblin Lord’s warriors growled and shouted in protest. Pyrite blinked at the unexpected denial. And Reiss? He laughed.
It was such a peaceful, happy sound. Reiss laughed and leapt from the back of his Shield Spider. He landed lightly. Rags stared at him from the back of his Carn Wolf. Reiss walked forwards and Pyrite tensed, but the Goblin Lord didn’t attack. He walked next to Rags.
“We must keep moving. The Humans will attack my people if we do not move.”
He pointed to the rear where the Goblins had halted due to the confrontation. Rags glanced in that direction and frowned.
“Those are Tremborag Goblins. Not yours.”
“They are Goblins. My people. They should not die.”
Reiss looked at Rags. She blinked and then slowly nodded. She pointed.
“Move out!”
Her tribe began moving. Reiss pointed and his army did the same. Rags expected him to get back on his Shield Spider, but to her surprise it began to shuffle back into the line of Goblins. Reiss started walking. He glanced up at Rags.
“Will you walk with me, Chieftain Rags? My warriors will pull back. Snapjaw, Eater, return and wait for me.”
“But Reiss—”
Snapjaw protested, but Reiss shook his head. Eater of Spears pulled her gently back and they disappeared into the crowd. Rags hesitated.
Now would be the time to kill the Goblin Lord. If she were Garen. But she had real reason to doubt Garen’s words. Especially now. She looked at the Goblin Lord. Then she shrugged and leapt from the back of her Carn Wolf.
“No walk. Will jog.”
“True.”
Reiss began to jog. Rags ran with him. The two moved ahead as the other Goblins gave them a wide berth. It was strange. Reiss ran naturally, breathing steadily. Rags had to run harder to keep up. She didn’t know what to say to him. He wasn’t like what she expected. She had thought he would be a monster. But he wasn’t. He had black eyes, but everything else about him was normal. Friendly, even.
“I don’t hurt my tribe.”
Reiss spoke first. He looked at Rags seriously.
“They fight for me. Die for me. And I lead them. Sometimes poorly. But I don’t mistreat them.”
Rags shrugged noncommittally.
“You make them undead.”
She pointed to a group of zombies rapidly shuffling to keep up. They were given a wide berth by other Goblins. Reiss nodded.
“That is true. But I am a [Necromancer]. I raise the dead. The Goblins who died fight for me. So other, living Goblins won’t die. I would let them rest if I could, but I cannot. Is that wrong?”
“No.”
Rags conceded the point. This was strange! Reiss actually sounded sad. And his voice—Rags peered up at his eyes again.
“Are you slave, though?”
This time, Reiss hesitated. He looked at Rags and then glanced behind her. She knew Garen and Tremborag were behind them. She could vaguely sense them too. Although they were embers to the Goblin Lord’s fire.
“Who told you that? Garen Redfang? Tremborag?”
“Maybe. Is true?”
“True. And false. I have a master. But…”
“Reiss!”
Rags turned. She heard a shout and the sounds of fighting. She turned and saw Snapjaw and Eater of Spears crashing back towards them. Pyrite swung his battleaxe, but too slow. Garen parried the blow and charged towards Reiss.
His eyes blazed. He swung his blade up as he charged the Goblin Lord. Reiss had stopped. He watched Garen charge him. His hands turned black with magic and he pointed.
