He didn’t like the Hive. There were no birds in the Hive. He always had to work in the Hive. But he had promised Pawn, so he went down inside. He passed through the entrance into dry dirt. Then he saw the Soldiers.
“Hello. I am Bird.”
They stared at him from their alcoves. Big Soldiers. They would kill him if he wasn’t a Worker, Bird knew. He walked past them, humming. Then his hum vanished. He felt himself enter the Hive.
There was a difference there. A rhythm. A flow. Bird didn’t like it. He had lived in the Hive for almost all his life, but when he entered the lines of Soldiers and Workers moving in perfect synch, it was still a struggle to move with them.
Walk. Stop. Walk. Turn. Step left to let Soldiers go past. Walk. Stop. Turn. Turn.
Each Worker moved in unison with the others. Each one stopped and stepped precisely. The crisscrossing lines of Antinium were efficient. Bird didn’t like it. He shifted, awkwardly holding the rucksack Erin had given him. He wished he’d brought his bow, but he’d forgotten it on the table. He hoped Erin didn’t throw it away.
Walk. Stop. Step left. Turn. Walk. Walk. Turn.
At least he could do this without having to think as hard. So long as he became one with the others, Bird wouldn’t fall out of place. Reassured by this, he began to hum to himself.
“Birds and pretzels, birds and pretzels. I like birds. I cannot eat pretzels.”
He stopped when he realized no one was moving. Bird looked around. All the Antinium in the tunnel were staring at him. All of them. Hundreds. Bird hunched his shoulders. Suddenly he felt bad and his insides hurt.
“I am Bird. I did not mean to sing.”
After a moment, the flow resumed. Hunched, afraid, Bird moved as one. He did not sing again. Soon he reached his destination.
“Bird. You remembered!”
Pawn stood in the barracks. Bird stared at him and waved one of his four hands.
“Hello Pawn.”
He stared around the big barracks. It was bigger than before. And there were more Workers and Soldiers in it. That was Bird’s only observation. He noticed three other Workers waiting for him.
“Belgrade and Anand. Oh. And Garry.”
“Hello Bird. We have not spoken in a long time.”
“We haven’t?”
Bird stared blankly at Garry. Then he shifted his attention to what the Worker had brought.
“Oh. Food!”
The [Cook] nodded.
“I have brought a few treats to share. What is that you are holding, Bird?”
Bird remembered the rucksack. Carefully he placed it on the mound of dirt the Workers were using as a table.
“This is food from Miss Erin. She says it is for me to share with everyone. It did not get wet.”
“How wonderful.”
Anand and Belgrade immediately clustered around the rucksack. Garry and Pawn held back. Bird looked around. Yes, there were more colorful Soldiers around. That was good. Bird stared at Yellow Splatters reading a book, Purple Smile doing something like dancing and showing the other Workers and Soldiers how to do it too, and then he found the special thing. It was always what he looked at. On the barracks, on the far wall, was a white bird. A symbol of one of the Soldiers. Bird always liked staring at it.
“This is delicious. What are these things? Bird? Bird?”
Someone interrupted Bird. He looked around.
“Oh. Those are fish flakes.”
“Fish flakes?”
The other Workers were intrigued. Bird nodded. He explained them as best he could.
