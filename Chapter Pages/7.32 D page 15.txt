They laughed and patted her on the back, clapped her shoulder, or gave her an approving nod. Ulinde smiled. And she knew this was her team. The reason she’d idolized the Halfseekers hadn’t been because they had a Selphid on their team. Well, it hadn’t been the only reason. It was because they were like this.
Good people. Then Ulinde heard another [Message] go ping in her head. She blinked.
“Mold? Hang on, there’s one other thing…”

The Wandering Inn. Erin Solstice frowned. She rubbed at one ear. It was ringing.
“What did you say?”
Jelaqua said it again. She, Ulinde—Seborn and Moore were downstairs, investigating something in Octavia’s shop. Erin Solstice looked at her friends. She had to be tired after arguing with Wailant, Teliv, and doing business stuff all day.
“What?’
“Earth.”
Erin slowly sat down in the [Garden of Sanctuary]. She had been trying to plant potatoes. She looked at Jelaqua and Ulinde. Then she grinned.
“Well, yeah. I guess I’m from earth. Uh, there’s lot of earth all over. Here, there, everywhere—”
Neither Selphid blinked. Jelaqua looked at [Innkeeper].
“Erin—we know. We’re not idiots. We’ve heard you and Numbtongue when you’re not being quiet enough. And Ulinde’s from Wistram.”
“Oh.”
Erin considered this. She had a trowel in hand, potato in the other. She debated throwing the potato at Jelaqua, running for it and…well, what?
“And someone…knows another person from Earth? This, uh, place I’ve never—”
The Selphids both raised an eyebrow. Erin threw down her potato.
“Fine. They know another person from Earth?”
“That’s right, Miss Erin. It’s complicated. The Selphid…authority is trying to get us in touch with Joseph. They know he’s from Earth.”
“How do they know? He just plays soccer! Football!”
Erin snapped. She felt sweat on the back of her neck. Ulinde shrugged.
“Apparently someone from Earth saw him. Erin. They have someone from Earth who wants to speak with him.”
The young woman froze. She looked up.
“Someone else?”
Neither Jelaqua nor Ulinde was prepared for the hungry look in Erin’s eye. The [Innkeeper] rose to her feet.
“Who? I mean—what’s their name? Are they okay? Where are they from?”
Jelaqua gnawed on a lip. Ulinde waved her hands.
“We don’t know! I have specific orders, Erin. They want me to get Joseph to a secret place and then they’ll relay [Message] spells through me. I’m not Palt. I can’t do [Speak] spells and they don’t want Wistram to know. But…they know. Joseph’s from another world. And…so are you. We know that, not them. And we didn’t tell them.”
“Another world. Earth.”
The Gold-rank Captain looked at Erin. Strangely, but with raised brows. It made sense and it didn’t. There stood Erin Solstice. She looked into Jelaqua’s eyes. The [Innkeeper]’s gaze flickered. She bit her lip, scuffed a foot on the dirt she’d cleared for planting.
Then she shrugged.
“Well, yeah. Sorry I didn’t tell you, Jelaqua. It’s this whole thing. I’m from Earth. Another world. It’s not like this one. Keep it secret.”
She looked at Jelaqua. At Ulinde. The three stood together. No one knew quite what to say. Erin glanced at their faces. She threw up her hands.
“Psyche! Just kidding! Hah, you fell for that? Hilarious!”
The two Selphids blinked at her. Erin lowered her hands. She checked their expressions, scuffed a toe.
“Darn. Okay, let’s think this one out. Come with me.”

“Miss Geneva. Our Selphid has made contact with Joseph.”
Geneva Scala nearly dropped her basin of wet towels. The clinic was full of noise, the staff checking on patients, groans, even eating, but even so she beckoned the Selphid away.
