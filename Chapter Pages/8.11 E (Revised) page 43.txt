The rulers of Khelt and Califor looked at her. Slowly, the first Queen of Khelt knelt.
“It often seems so. And it often is, young woman. But such is challenge. Will you rise to it? This world needs a [Hero], and the Dynasty of Khelt shall forge you into one if need be.”
She offered Erin a hand. Slowly, the [Innkeeper] looked up.
“But I’m just an [Innkeeper].”
The rulers of Khelt exchanged a look of concern.
 
—-
 
“[Innkeeper]. Innkeeper. Of all the classes…does any scholar here, any of the great rulers recall a class by which an [Innkeeper] rose to power?”
The dead rulers of Chandrar held great conference. Giants sat in the sands next to [Archmages] who had called Chandrar home. The Dynasty of Khelt, as the protectors here, led the meeting.
The great minds and famous adventurers looked at each other.
“I knew a [Farmer] who became legend.”
A [King] wearing a crown of glass raised a hand and spoke after a moment. An [Archmage] sitting in the air rolled his eyes.
“Yes, but that was a [Farmer]. I could name a hundred and eighty nine [Farmers] who became [Heroes]. An [Innkeeper], though? I can’t think of any…”
Erin loitered in the background, feeling embarrassed. The ruler of Khelt spoke—Califor was more practical.
“I must find every [Witch] who lives or has come here. We will teach you. Maviola El told us you were akin to our natures. I think that is so.”
Erin spluttered, astounded.
“What, me? I’m not [Witch]-y. I don’t even know magic!”
Califor gave her a look under the brim of her hat with a lot less respect than she had given the ruler of Khelt.
“Then you shall learn.”
The [Witch] strode off. Erin stood, scuffing her feet in the dirt.
“Well, what do I do?”
She looked around. Ghosts milled about her, talking, looking for those they knew. Many wanted to speak to her, but were kept back, respectfully. After all, she was the living girl among the dead. Erin called out.
“Abel? Has anyone seen Abel?”
“Here!”
The ghost appeared. Erin looked at him.
“I don’t know what to do, Abel. Should I just wait around?”
The young man looked at the gathering of greatness. He nodded wistfully.
“I wish I could help. But I’m not that great. I just…I died so soon. I could try to remember something from Earth, but I wasn’t an engineer or anything.”
Erin smiled sadly.
“That’s okay. I’m not sure all this knowledge is going to help that much. I mean, I’m dead. What am I going to do, learn to use a sword? I don’t even like fighting. I served adventurers, but I never wanted to be one.”
She waved a hand. Erin looked back the way she’d come. Towards her inn.
“I’m just an [Innkeeper]. I just wish…”
She looked at Abel again. Erin slowly turned her head. So many ghosts around her. So many…and so many sanctuaries emptied. So many lost. Weak ghosts were prey the moment they died, apparently.
Was there a chance…? Erin spoke, slowly.
“I remember them. If Zel and Maviola…excuse me. Excuse me!”
She raised her voice. The milling ghosts looked around. The rulers of Khelt broke off in a discussion with the [Monks], [Martial Artists], [Weapon Trainers], and the [Sage] who had invented Sage’s Grass as Erin floated up to shout. Erin saw fierce warriors, [Martial Artists] who were bare-chested, talking with great experts, one of whom had a blade three times as tall as he was.
The [Sage] had a cape like Rabbiteater’s, which was not cloth, but substances flowing like cloth. Water, liquid metal, alchemical substances like mercury, all of which could be plucked from the trailing cape nearly ten feet long at a whim and used for great workings.
