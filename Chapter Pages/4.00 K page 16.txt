“It was a simple preservation spell for the ice. As to the head…I kept it as a reminder. Of my fallen companion. Of the man I knew. Of my failure. And as a promise.”
“Promise?”
Trey’s voice was faint. Flos turned and nodded.
“I promised Drevish to build a city like none the world had ever seen. In my kingdom. I told him that it would be his plans by which every brick was laid and every house built. That was my vow to him. And I have not kept it. He did not live to see it, but perhaps…”
“You’re going to show it? To his head?”
Teres’ voice was a horrified whisper. Flos nodded gravely. It made a terrible kind of sense to Trey, but his sister was pale and swaying.
“It is all I can offer him. When I show him my kingdom, then perhaps my conscience—”
“No.”
Trey felt a shock. But the word didn’t come from him. It came from Teres. She was staring at the block of ice with Drevish’s head. Flos was surprised too. He stared at Teres.
“What do you mean?”
“No. You can’t let him stay like this. You have to bury him.”
Both Trey and Flos stared at her. There were tears in Teres’ eyes. She looked at Flos, angrily.
“You can’t keep his head like this. Not frozen. Not—you can’t do it. You have to bury his head.”
The [King] froze. Trey froze. He had never heard Teres use that tone in Flos’ palace. He had never heard anyone use that tone with Flos, either. The King’s head bowed. He turned and stared down at the block of ice. His voice was low as he replied.
“He is my vassal. I owe him this.”
“It’s wrong.”
Trey looked at Teres. She stood with her fists clenched, staring at the [King]’s back. Trey reached out—to stop her?—but she knocked his hand away.
“It may seem odd to one from another world like you, but it is how I honor my sworn companion. Drevish would understand—”
“No. I know it’s wrong. Trey knows it’s wrong. Anyone would know that! Ask Orthenon, ask Mars or Gazi—”
Teres voice was pleading. She was trying to make Flos understand, but the [King]’s head didn’t move.
“Don’t keep him in this room. Don’t make him stay here. Let him sleep!”
She raised her voice and nearly shouted that last bit. Trey was petrified. As Flos’ back turned, he saw an expression he had only seen once before on the [King]’s face.
Anger.
“This is not a matter on which I will change my mind. I failed Drevish. This is his last memory. Here!”
Flos gestured at the head angrily.
“I will not forsake him again. I abandoned him once, and he paid with his life for it. I will not bury his memory and turn away from it as I have so much before. This conversation is over. You two—leave. Seek out Orthenon until I call for you again.”
He made to walk towards his door. But Teres barred his path.
“You can’t do it. You have to let him go. He deserves better than this!”
Trey’s breath was gone. He gaped at his sister. Flos’ brows shot together.
“No. Move out of my way.”
“I won’t.”
Teres was shaking. She pointed at the block of ice.
“You’re keeping him—just like he was when he died! Bury him! It’s disrespectful. And he deserves rest!”
Rest. That word rang true to Trey. He stared at Drevish’s head. It was preserved, so that he could be by his king’s side even in death. Whether he liked it or not. Just like…Trey. And Teres.
Flos’ voice was very quiet.
“Do not talk to me about disrespect. I was not the one who killed him. I was not the one who froze him.”
“But you’re the one who’s keeping him this way.”
Flos’ head turned and Trey realized he was the one who spoke. The [King] stared at the two twins.
“Begone from my sight.”
