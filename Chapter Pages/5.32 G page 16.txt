I hear the [Lord]’s voice muffle itself and ignore the scuffle behind me. Rags is tilting her head, inspecting me carefully. Without fear. She’s curious.
“Why close eyes? Bad eyes?”
“No. Blind.”
Head tilt. She squints at me. All the while the crossbow never wavers.
“How can see?”
“Skill. Special [Emperor] Skill.”
“Ah.”
She pauses. I wait a beat but she doesn’t ask anything more. I want—if there was a way—but not now. I fear what will come, but I try anyways.
“What you said? About peace treaty? You want talk?”
She scowls. I sense that quite clearly. She points at me with one hand while she keeps the other hand steady, balancing the crossbow on her wolf’s head. It whines softly.
“No talk bad! I can talk like you. You do not talk like I do!”
“Very well. What do you want? Peace? This is hardly peaceful.”
She laughs.
“Is it not? This way is best way! Peace! I point this at you and if you don’t make peace, I shoot you.”
Outrage around me. I smile. There’s something so refreshing about that.
“If you shoot me, my people will kill you. You will not escape these lands alive.”
Rags gives me a long, blank look.
“Right. That why peace works.”
A stalemate. I slowly nod.
“So then. What is your peace, Chieftain Rags?”
She pauses. It hurts to sense how delighted she is to be called Chieftain. My chest burns with pain.
“Peace is simple. You take army away from city. I take my army away from lands. Your army not follow. I go. You let leave.”
Again, Rags’ words provoke an uproar, but not from my people. Rather, it’s the nobles and Lady Rie who react. She whispers urgently into my ears.
“Your majesty, she can’t be serious! If we let a Goblin tribe roam free your reputation—”
“Prost.”
He pulls Lady Rie back, ignoring her outrage. I tap my chin with a finger.
“And your proof that you won’t turn back and continue raiding my lands?”
Another shrug. It seems very Goblin.
“No proof. You send army if I come back. We fight again.”
“That’s not good enough.”
She shifts on her wolf’s back testily.
“Not good enough? Goblins are stinking cowards. We run away! I make peace. Don’t have to. Could kill you now.”
She lifts the crossbow as proof of her bona fides. I sense Gamel tense again. If it comes to it…Bismarck is waiting behind one of the houses. I have close to a thousand of my subjects here. The rest are hiding with those unable to fight. The nobles have their entourage as well. Not enough. Sixty elite Goblins plus their wolves…that’s like a hundred and twenty warriors. It will be a slaughter.
“How would the peace work? I tell my soldiers to go? What will you do?”
Rags bares her teeth. They’re sharp. Small.
“You send message. Tell them to go. Then we go. We stand here one hour. Then I go.”
She wants us to stand here for an hour? It might work. It could work. I want to laugh. I want to tell her to lower the crossbow, to sit, to let me apologize and ask her—but I shake my head.
“It’s a good plan. It might have worked. But I’m sorry, Chieftain Rags. There will be no peace.”
Behind me, Lady Rie inhales sharply. I see Rags waver. For the first time she looks surprised. Uncertain.
“Why not?”
I wait before responding. When I do, my voice is steady. I can say the words now. Pain—pain has already done its work.
“You came too late, Chieftain of the Flooded Waters tribe. Our armies have already fought. Someone ordered my army to assault your tribe. The battle is lost. Your tribe won.”
A moan rises from the crowd. I feel the horror rise around me, see faces turn to me with terror mounting. Rags stares at me. The crossbow wavers.
“My tribe won?”
