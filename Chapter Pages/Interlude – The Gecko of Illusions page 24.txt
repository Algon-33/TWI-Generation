Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

“Relc. Listen to me. You can stop this. You have to spread the word. We—we need to speak to the Council. Erin, people have to know.”
Ryoka spoke urgently. The Drake was shaking his head. Erin looked up.
“Tell the Council?”
“Yes. Everyone has to know. Where’s Montressa and Beza? If Palt knows—does Wistram know?”
Ryoka had been avoiding them. But this was different. She felt—she knew this was the work of someone from Earth. It had to be. Someone had invented a Ponzi scheme and unleashed it.
“I’ll get in touch with Krshia. I think she’s working. We can tell her about it. Relc—”
“Shut up!”
The Drake hit the table again. This time it cracked. Ryoka flinched as the wood itself gave way before the [Spearmaster]’s fury. Relc stood there, panting. Ryoka reached for Erin. She had seen this, felt that rage.
But Erin Solstice didn’t back away. She looked at Relc. And Ryoka felt—she withdrew her hand.
“Relc.”
The aura of the inn was heavy around Erin. Not pushing on anyone. But Relc looked up. The young woman stood there. Staring at him gravely.
Not without kindness. That was the hardest part. The [Innkeeper] hesitated. But then she spoke.
“It’s not real. The Golden Triangle is fake. Relc—I know you put so much time into it. But it is going to fall apart. Ryoka and I know it. Because of…where we come from.”
His eyes widened. Ryoka opened her mouth, but Erin went on.
“Believe us. Believe me. I know it’s not real. Someone’s done something cruel. And I can’t force you to take my words. But Relc. It is bad. And if you keep selling the Golden Triangle…you can’t be in this inn. I’m sorry.”
An ultimatum. Ryoka felt the wrongness of it. She tensed.
“Erin—”
It was her way or nothing. That was Erin Solstice. Relc inhaled, heavily. His fists were clenched, his eyes hot.
“Is that it?”
“No. It’s not. Erin, don’t ban him. Keep talking.”
“But it’s wrong, Ryoka.”
The [Innkeeper] glared at Ryoka. And the City Runner felt a hot flash. This was Palt and drugs. If Erin hated something—she opposed it with all her might. She was as stubborn as—as—
Ryoka. But Erin Solstice didn’t know what it was like to feel everything falling apart. And that was what was happening to Relc. The table began to reassemble itself, thanks to Erin’s Skill. But the Drake was alone.
“Relc. I know it’s hard to accept. Listen to me. It’s no one’s fault. We only know because—”
The Drake moved. Ryoka paused as she reached for him. He looked at her for a second, and then at Erin.
“So that’s it? I’m banned if I keep doing this?”
“No.”
“Yes. I’m sorry, Relc. But I know it’s bad.”
Erin’s voice was level. Ryoka hissed. Relc glanced at her. His claws were tight. Ryoka expected him to take a swing—perhaps not at Erin, but at the table, maybe. It was what she would have done. The worst part was that Erin had no proof. It was so hard to convince someone in the thick of a scam that it was false. Ryoka searched for words…
And Relc nodded. His shoulder slumped.
“Feels familiar.”
The two young women stared at him. So did the other guests. Relc looked around. It was easy to describe Guardsman Relc. He was…
“I did this once, didn’t I? About the Goblins. I got kicked out and then—turns out I was wrong.”
The Drake reflected to no one at all. He looked at Erin.
“You were right about that. Looks like I’m always the idiot. That sounds right. More than anything else.”
Erin’s face fell.
“I didn’t mean that, Relc—I’m just worried about—listen—”
She reached out. Relc backed away. He reached for the money pouch, the gold coins. And then he looked at Ryoka, helplessly.
“It’s all fake? Every bit of it?”
