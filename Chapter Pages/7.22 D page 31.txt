“I know you don’t like the idea. But sometimes [Doctors] need people to guard their backs. Or manage difficult patients, idiots, and so forth.”
She looked at him. And her temper boiled over. She was tired. And Daly had injured one of the ill people badly enough that they were now in one of the new cots. She leaned forwards and hissed at him.
“And what is the powder for?”
The adventurer’s eyes flickered. He looked at Geneva.
“If the idiots bring War Walkers. There are some people who’d slaughter saints, Geneva. You know that. Look—let’s not talk about it now. You need rest.”
“Not yet. Don’t touch me. You’ll get infected.”
Geneva jerked back. Her protective armor moved as she walked back inside the clinic. She was sweating too, from the heat. She sat back next to Aiko. And kept working, ignoring the voice in her head.

“Stop. You’re not well, Geneva.”
Three more hours later, Geneva was checking patients at the door to her clinic as the Bushrangers admitted them one by one. Okasha was pleading with her. Geneva had stopped listening.
“Next!”
A young woman said something outside. There were complaints, but the Bushrangers didn’t let anyone in. A woman came from the side, through the clinic.
“I said, no one enters that way—”
Geneva shot to her feet, angry. She saw Paige, without the protective gear, standing in the center of the clinic. She didn’t approach Geneva, who had some of the infectious material on her armor. Geneva opened her mouth, but someone else spoke for her.
“Paige! Talk some sense into Geneva!”
It was Okasha. Geneva closed her mouth with a snap. Paige nodded.
“I’m going to do just that, Okasha. Geneva—you need to sleep. You’re dead on your feet and you’re compromising your own systems.”
“I’ll rest…later. I need to keep checking people. Keep them calm.”
Paige exhaled slowly.
“Let one of us take over. We can at least repeat what you told them.”
“No. I have the Skills. I can manage it. I’ll take a stamina potion.”
Geneva shook her head a few times. Paige opened and closed her mouth. And then the [Engineer] glared.
“Geneva, let one of us take over. Rest! You know, we can help too. We might not be [Doctors], but if you tell us what to do, we can try. You don’t have to stop the entire Yellow Rivers plague on your own. You don’t have to be the actual Last Light of Baleros.”
The [Doctor]’s head jerked back.
“I never said that.”
“No, but you act like it. We’re not idiots. We can take over. You need. To. Sleep.”
“Not yet. There are patients waiting outside. I’ll—set up a second inspection station. But put some gear on! Training someone to always be here is a good idea. But give me two more hours. I can use my Skill on Aiko again…”
Geneva began to turn back to call for someone else. She had to keep working. This was a crucial moment. Sleep? She could sleep once people were calm. Once Aiko was stable. She could not lose anyone. She—
Something was wrong. Geneva wasn’t moving. She tried—and realized her body had locked up.
“Okasha? Something’s wrong.”
“Paige is right, Geneva. You need to sleep. I can’t let you do this to yourself. We’re going to bed, Paige.”
Geneva got up and began to walk to the changing room. The [Doctor] spoke.
“No, we’re not. Stop that. Okasha? Okasha.”
A voice whispered in her head.
“I’m putting you in the box. This is for your own good.”
Geneva shouted, but it was internally.
“Don’t you dare, Okasha! No! Don’t you d—”
 
[Doctor Level 34!]
[Skill – Disease Detector obtained!]

Geneva woke up with a start. She looked around, saw daylight shining into her room. Only—the sun had gone backwards in the sky.
