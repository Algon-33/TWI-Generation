Gravity. Some kind of gravity, no, something pulled it downwards. For a moment it was visible, a shadow even amongst darkness. The Huntress and Dancing Man peered over the edge.
“Norechl is dead.”
The Huntress said at last. The Dancing Man hesitated.
“What if it is not? The others must know. If it is dead it is one thing. Down there. But if not?”
If not? The two looked at each other.
They stared down for a long time, over the edge. Into…
The two backed away. They fled, hoping that their kin was dead. But worse things than death existed.
So the music ran still, as Rhir stirred and Antinium held. So music played, a beautiful thing across places, connecting, binding. A powerful force indeed, until you remembered:
There were places you could fall where even music had died.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I’m back. The Last Tide finished its Kickstarter shortly before now. Which is good.
It’s time to write. Thank you for making it a huge success and I hope you enjoy it! I think it’s not going to be too long in coming out? Obviously printing takes longer, but the digital versions might be soon?
I’m tired so I’m not making sense. And I have a confession: I wrote this in two parts, not three because I uh, forgot what day it was. So yesterday I realized very late that I hadn’t even done a bit of writing and had to make it up.
Even so, I got a big chapter done! I hope the quality didn’t suffer, but I’m off break!
And no, this isn’t the poll chapter. Sometimes you have to write what fits and I think this fits. I’ll give you the poll chapter later in the month. Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy!
