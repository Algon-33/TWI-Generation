She spoke clearly, with a perfect mastery of the common tongue. The huge Goblin [Warrior] was not so eloquent.
“You trade with Humans?”
He scowled at Mavika, completely unafraid of her. Just…annoyed. Anazurhe corrected the other Chieftain.
“With a [Witch]. Do not anger her or she will eat your eyes. Now. Mavika, why do you come?”
Mavika and the Goblin traded looks. The Chieftain rumbled.
“I was here first.”
Annoyance crossed the Goblin [Witch]’s face.
“You are not a [Witch]. You come to me for a favor. Be silent. Mavika?”
The crow-[Witch] suppressed her annoyance. It was always like this, treating with Anazurhe. She was strong. Wiskeria did not know her, but she would have named her with Califor and Mavika in the same breath. But Anazurhe had not gone to Riverfarm. What might have happened then? Well—the Goblin [Witch] preferred secrecy and the [Witches] had been understandably reluctant to bring a Goblin to negotiations with an [Emperor] they wanted the favor of.
“I bring you two things. Anazurhe. The lesser is a message.”
“From who?”
“The [Shaman] of the Mountain City tribe.”
Mavika offered Anazurhe a letter written on parchment. The [Witch] took the scroll. She opened it, read. After less than a minute she laughed.
Fire blossomed from her hands and ate the parchment away. The [Witch] turned away.
“One [Shaman] does not interest me. Worthless. Why did you really come?”
The huge male Chieftain grunted; whether that was an affirmation or condemnation was unclear. He was impatiently staring into the basin of black liquid in the center of Anazurhe’s lair. Potions, ingredients lined the throne/workroom that the [Witch] possessed.
Mavika nodded. She had done that as a favor. The second thing was just as simple, if…far more urgent.
“The second thing I bring is news for all [Witches] this world over to hear: Belavierr the Stitch Witch has betrayed her kind. She has slain Califor for her own ends, unprovoked. She is a [Witch] alone. Let no one give her aid. Hound her wherever she hides. The Spider has transgressed.”
The Goblin [Witch] swung around slowly. This time—there was no mocking smile, no relaxed look.
“Califor is dead? Belavierr killed her?”
“Yes. If she comes to you—drive her away or kill her. She has lost many of her protections. But she is still Belavierr. A second thing—Riverfarm is now friend to [Witches]. The pact is made. There is also a colony of Goblins there. Treated…well. For Goblins.”
“Ah. So that was why the [Shaman] begged.”
Anazurhe smiled. The other Chieftain looked interested.
“Goblins in Riverfarm. Which tribe?”
Mavika ignored him. Anazurhe did too. She tipped her hat.
“Stay a day, Mavika. My tribe welcomes you. Tell me how Califor died.”
Mavika nodded. She produced a single bag and offered it to Anazurhe. With ritual and spell, she offered the gift. Old magic—just to make the value more.
“I will tell you of her death and what came after. Of an [Emperor] who sees nothing and all. Of Belavierr’s death that Califor took for her child. We will speak for a day, Anazurhe, then I leave you to your tribe. But first, a gift from the [Witches] of the Human tribes.”
The Goblin’s eyes brightened. She took the little sack and opened it. The Goblin [Warrior] wrinkled his nose. He sniffed.
It was tea.
“Ah. Eloise’s tea. Good. This is a good gift.”
“Anazurhe.”
The Chieftain had lost his patience. He brought one fist down on the basin containing the black liquid. It jumped and both [Witches] turned.
