How long had she slept? The [Doctor] began to scramble out of bed.
“Okasha! What did you do? What did you do?”
She shouted. There was a yawn in her head.
“Morning, Geneva. We were asleep. Wow, is it tomorrow? We must have slept for over—”
The woman shot out of her bed. She looked around wildly.
“You put me to sleep? What did you do when I was out?”
The Selphid’s voice was defensive.
“Nothing! You just went to sleep. That’s all. I told you, you were being unhealthy. But you didn’t listen.”
“Never do that again! You have no right when I have patients that need tending to!”
The Italian woman snapped. She looked around. She was in her underwear. Okasha had changed her clothes, put her in her private room. Geneva began to reach for her clothes, tug them on.
“Hey! I’m living here too! Your body was failing, Geneva. You need to sleep. I can’t keep doing this. Don’t ignore me! We need to work together, okay? You leveled up, didn’t you? I bet you did! Geneva!”
The [Doctor] was cursing. She had to get to her clinic, check on Aiko! She reached for her socks.
And her hand wouldn’t move. Geneva Scala froze. Then she sat back and sighed. Her mouth moved.
“Okasha?”
“Yes?”
The Selphid replied with Geneva’s voice, altering it slightly. Geneva had to wait for her to finish to respond.
“Stop taking control of me. I have to go to work.”
“Oh yeah? Well, perhaps you could thank me for looking out for you? I have to help too.”
“I—thank you?”
“Yes. And agree that you need sleep. Every fourteen hours. Agreed?”
“If there’s a patient—”
“Let the nurses handle it! Or a [Healer]! But that’s the rule. Understand?”
“I—can’t agree to that. I’ve sworn an oath.”
Geneva’s hand rose and jabbed herself in the chest.
“Well, that oath doesn’t involve killing yourself. Those are the rules. If you don’t agree, we can sit here.”
The woman’s mouth moved for a while. But she didn’t move. At last, she spoke in a strangled voice.
“Fine. I agree.”
She smiled for a moment.
“Good! Then we can go.”
Geneva didn’t move. After a second, the [Doctor] spoke again.
“Okasha?”
“Where’s my ‘thank you’?”
“…Thank you. Please let me go to work.”
“See? Was that so hard? You can be polite! And so can I!”
The body began to move as Geneva willed it. Slowly, she reached for her socks. Okasha went on, inside her head.
“You don’t appreciate me. I’d just like to be thanked for the hard work I do. Is that so much to ask? I should have veto rights as well.”
“But it’s my body.”
Geneva replied slowly. Okasha’s pause was long. Geneva’s mouth moved as the Selphid replied.
“You mean, our body.”

The Yellow Rivers disease landed in First Landing, Lailight Scintillation, and two Terandrian ports in three more days. Geneva knew because she was listening.
Or rather, Okasha was. The Selphid listened to gossip during her four hours off. Which now occurred every day.
They had negotiated. Okasha had stopped the bargaining on that point. Four hours, each day was ‘her time’. Of course, she let Geneva make suggestions.
And all ten hours Geneva got before they had their mandated sleep was spent at work. The plague was moving faster, so she was at her clinic, consulting other [Healers]…
Talenqual was not part of any of the Four Companies’ lands. It was, like many areas, under a company’s control, but semi-autonomous. Oh, it had treaties with larger companies, but it was ruled by Fezimet.
