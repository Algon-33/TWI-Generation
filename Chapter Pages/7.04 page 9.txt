“But there were big birds in Pallass. I saw them. And I was helping.”
Bird pointed towards his window. Erin nodded.
“I know. And you did help, Bird.”
“I shot many big birds. Through the eyes. They have very thick skins. The biggest bird did not die. I think it might be a super bird. Like the super man you told us about.”
Erin stifled a snort. Lyonette’s face didn’t change. Erin told Bird and Mrsha and Numbtongue and sometimes Lyonette many stories about her home. It was Bird’s dream to meet the bat man. Or the hawk man. Or an airplane. Well, one of his dreams.
The [Innkeeper] had schooled her face back to seriousness. She was biting one lip. She looked at Bird, meeting his eyes.
“Bird. You knew it would be trouble to go into Pallass. Didn’t you?”
Bird—paused. He didn’t meet Erin’s gaze. Bird shuffled his feet as he sat in the chair.
“I only wanted to eat big birds. I was helping.”
A pause. Erin looked at Bird. He was pretending to be very interested in the lining of his Fortress of Fluff. It was a familiar look. She’d seen Mrsha do the exact same thing. Erin felt Lyonette nudge her again. Erin glared at Lyonette, but she went on.
“Bird, I know you wanted to help. And you did. But you caused a lot of trouble. A lot. Klbkch shouldn’t have hit you, but you are in trouble.”
“Will he kill me?”
“No! But you can’t go to Pallass. Understand, Bird? Never.”
“But what if—”
“Never, Bird. Do you understand? Klbkch was being serious.”
Lyonette leaned forwards. Bird looked up at her.
“Yes, Miss Lyonette.”
Erin looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] nodded back at her. Erin turned to Bird. He was looking at her.
“I will never go to Pallass. May I go now?”
“No, Bird. There’s one more thing. Hitting you was wrong. Klbkch was wrong to do that. You know that, right?”
“Yes.”
Bird sounded like he was saying it just so Erin would be happy. She really didn’t know how far she was getting to him. Erin took a breath.
“But you also did something wrong that caused a lot of trouble. And you knew you weren’t supposed to. Didn’t you, Bird?”
No response. Erin wavered.
“So—so you’re going to be punished. Do you understand?”
Bird’s head snapped up and looked at her. And then he began to shake. No—quiver. The Antinium rocked back and forth, disturbing his fortress. His voice shook as he shrank back from the two young women.
“Am I going to be destroyed? Am I Aberration? Will the Free Queen kill me?”
It was everything Erin had feared. She looked at Lyonette and waved her arms quickly.
“No! No, Bird. We’d never do that.”
“No, never.”
Lyonette shook her head. Bird stopped quivering. He relaxed at once.
“Oh. Then what is my punishment?”
Erin wiped her brow. But here came the hard part. She looked at Bird. Lyonette had insisted and Erin had to admit, it was the only thing that would work. They had to make Bird understand. The [Innkeeper] hesitated—but Lyonette had insisted she deliver the news.
“You—you’re forbidden from hunting birds, Bird. For—for an entire week. And you…don’t get to eat birds either? Not even eggs.”
Erin glanced uncertainly at Lyonette. The [Princess] nodded.
“For an entire week. No birds. And if you lie or try to hunt them or eat them, it will be longer, Bird.”
She folded her arms and looked severely down at Bird. The Worker’s head swung from Erin to Lyonette. He stared at them. And Erin saw his mandibles open wide and droop. The Worker shook. Then he shouted.
“No!”
“Bird, listen. We don’t want to make you upset, but you know—”
“No! I do not want this!”
