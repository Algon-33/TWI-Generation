“Once upon a time, he needed no blades. His body was a weapon. He walked in shadows and danced like death as he cut his enemies apart. We lost his form in the waves, and only the Silent Queen’s imitations even come close to what he was. He was Centenium. And we will never recreate that, not with a thousand years of trying.”
Garry and Bird looked up. Garry was holding Bird protectively. He dragged Bird backwards slowly, edging away from the Queen.
“My Queen, what are the Centenium?”
The Free Queen watched him.
“The Centenium were a hundred prototypes, Garry. Created by the First Queen, whose skill was unrivaled, even by Bessachidia or the other Shaper Queens who came after. Each one unique. We could copy their forms, but never their identity. And now there are three. Three, from a hundred. Can you imagine the loss?”
“Yes, my Queen. But what can be done?”
Garry was tugging Bird back. A few more steps and he’d be out of the Free Queen’s immediate reach. She spoke slowly.
“That is the question all the Queens ask. Each has another answer, hence our Hives. The other Queens believe it is numbers, or armaments, of a superior form that will save the Antinium. I say not. I say, war with the Drakes is fruitless. I say we are bound to return. And I say that we must have our Centenium. Our leaders. Our heroes.”
Garry stopped. Bird looked up.
“Heroes, my Queen?”
She nodded. And the Free Queen rose as she raised herself on old limbs. Garry began to retreat with Bird. But the cavern was suddenly so small.
“The Centenium were heroes. They were our greatest, Individuals. For we had Individuals. Prognugators, even among the True Antinium. They led us. And they were what we have not been able to replicate. Queens and heroes. That is why I came to Liscor. And that is why you, Garry, and you Bird are precious. Too precious to kill.”
She caught them. Garry stopped. He looked up at the Free Queen. Bird did too, on his back.
“I am good at killing things. But I am only Bird.”
“Yes. But you are an Individual. One of four true Individuals. And you are strong, little Bird. Klbkchhezeim told me you killed a Flesh Worm yourself in the dungeon.”
“…Maybe? Was it a bird?”
The Free Queen shrugged.
“It does not matter. You are precious. And you sing. If you did not, little Bird, I would never have cared. But you sing. Bessachidia sang. And you are Bird.”
“Yes. Will you kill me, my Queen?”
“No.”
The Free Queen sat. She raised a feeler and Garry turned to her. And both he and she were trembling.
“Garry. Take Bird before I change my mind. Bring him somewhere else. Far from me. And Bird, grow your legs. Grow your arms. And go back to your inn. Grow. Level. And never be injured. Never come back to me. When you die, I will take your body and find out what makes you True Antinium.”
Garry bowed. Bird looked up at the Free Queen.
“But I like you.”
“And I like you, little Bird. So fly away. Or else I will eat you.”
The Free Queen bent. And Bird reached up. She touched his hand. And Garry pulled him towards the door. The Soldiers stood there. Garry slowed. Her mandibles opened and he gasped. The Free Queen ignored him. She looked past Garry, past Bird. And she spoke to the Antinium gathered there, and to her faithful Prognugator above.
“Klbkchhezeim. Come back to the Hive. You say it is time? Very well. I am ready. Show these Drakes, then. And show the Free Antinium something akin to what you were. What Xrn is.”
She rose. And Garry and Bird stopped. The Antinium standing in the doorway paused and the Soldier retreated. The Free Queen spoke.
