Interlude – The Tribes of Izril
Page 25
Travellers from Earth.
Even warriors from distant Rhir, like the Gnoll who had taken his first step on his homeland and fought in the company of friends from every species on 5th Wall.
First Warrior Merish, followed by a hopping little Lizardman with a peg leg and a staff. Returning to his tribe and home.
Erin Solstice blankly sat for a moment, having finished getting the dye off her skin. In a moment she’d get back to the hotly-contested chess tournament, which was deciding the runners-up as the final game awaited.
Still. She had promised to go to Ryoka’s party—and still had no word on Ryoka Griffin other than that she was alive. She had not woken up.
After that? After that—Erin sighed. She looked around her inn. The steamy bath room aside—Snapjaw half-dozing in a hot-tub with a floating bowl of peanuts in the water over the controlled flames—her inn was a protective shell.
Like a hermit crab, the [Innkeeper] had crawled in here one day, blown up her inn, rebuilt it, blown it up—
But it was her home. She did not leave it. She had been in Celum, and that was an ordeal in itself that she had taken a long time to get back from. She went to other cities via her magic door…but a journey that far? Erin Solstice sighed.
“…I might as well get coffee while I’m at it.”
“What’s that?”
“Energy beans.”
“Mm.”
Snapjaw smacked her lips. Erin Solstice sat back and luxuriated in the heat for a moment. Wheels. Kevin made wheels.
It was just a thought. But it became a certainty. Uh oh. There was no taking it back.
“…I wonder if I can make a mini-inn on wheels or something?”
She was going to the Meeting of Tribes.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: For once, a short chapter! A…very short chapter! If 15,000 words has let you down, I deeply apologize.
But I’m out of energy. Super-out. This month of November has been insane. I can say that, right? Big chapters, big events…
One more month for the year! I’ll be back, don’t worry! Recharged! Ready to write! In the meantime, do vote on the side story coming back! I can’t promise I’ll be able to offer it again, especially with the end of Volume 7 so close. It should be up with the chapter. Thanks for reading, and see you next month!
I’m going to snooze. Hopefully not in a hot tub.
 
Today’s art will be Gresaria, by ArtsyNada, a great tribute to the [Harbormistress] of First Landing! Last, because it fits, Gnolls! Specifically Mrsha, in a…Santa costume by Brack, and a super-hungry and evil one by Plushie. Thanks so much!
