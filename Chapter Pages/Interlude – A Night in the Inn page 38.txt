Interlude – A Night in the Inn
Page 38
“I’m actually a decent player. I run a chess magazine. I haven’t updated in a while…this inn has all kinds of entertainment. The plays, drinks…”
“I saw. So what’s your job?”
“Managing the city. It’s boring—well, it used to be. But I’m still not doing much.”
“Really? A [Strategist] who doesn’t do much? Why?”
“Well, we have a Watch Captain. And a Council. I just give advice.”
“Hm. So you’re just not doing your job?”
Olesm blinked. Maviola gave him a steady look. The Drake found himself clarifying.
“No, I mean, I have ideas. But we have the budget to think of, and we can’t just shake things up—”
“What ideas?”
“Well—I have a number of proposals, but I don’t want to get into them—”
“Like what, exactly?”
The Drake opened and closed his mouth. He peered at Maviola. And the [Lady] moved a piece.
“Check, by the way.”
Olesm looked down at his board. She winked at him.

Erin talked with Saliss for a while. Then she went into her garden, uprooted a flower, and handed it to him. She sat in her inn.
Better. Not full of angry fire. Still upset. But better. Erin sighed to herself.
“One step at a time.”
The coin burned in her pocket. And Erin had a supposition. Or perhaps it had just been a dream.
But where had the coin come from?
She looked around her inn. And shook her head.
“Dead gods. Dead gods…what a day.”
She looked around. People were applauding the exhausted [Actors]. But many were leaving. The Lamia—the Lamia was smiling at Lyonette, keeping his distance from Lism and Alonna as Krshia shook his hand and left the inn.
Sour notes amid the good. But Erin had given a flower away to an [Alchemist] who told her he could experiment—it just might take a lot of flowers. And she saw Lyonette counting a pile of silver from the magical door.
Good and bad. And perhaps it was because Erin was in a decent mood that the world decided to give her one last kick in the pants. Or again, it could be it was just chance.
“Erin. Excuse me, Erin, we have a problem.”
Ishkr walked over to Erin. The [Innkeeper] groaned.
“What is it, Ishkr?”
“Some of our guests…can’t pay for their meal.”
The Gnoll grimaced. Erin did too. That happened now and then.
“How much did they buy?”
Ishkr named the number. Erin fell out of her chair.
“How?”
“Drinks. Ice cream. Pizzas. Blue fruit juice, chocolate—”
Ishkr rattled off the most expensive items on the menu. Especially the ice cream and chocolate. Erin saw Lyonette’s head turning with wrath and ruination. Both she and Lyonette marched over to the arguing group of seven.
“I thought we had enough!”
“We did! Why does it cost gold?”
“Because no one checked the prices! I—oh—”
Lyonette propped her hands on her hips, looking at the group of young people. Erin blinked. There was something…familiar about them.
“Call the Watch, Erin?”
The [Princess] looked annoyed. Rose raised her hands hurriedly.
“No, please!”
“Someone call for the Watch? I can hit a few people before I get to bed!”
Relc was in a fine mood. He had autographs from the Players, and he was beaming after seeing the new play. He raised a jovial fist. The Earthers stared at him. Kevin laughed incredulously.
“No way. Right?”
He looked around. But Joseph and Rose had seen Erin. They were staring.
“Erin, it’s us. Rose. Remember? Uh—we know each other?”
This time Lyonette and Ishkr both rolled their eyes.
“That’s the oldest trick in the book. Relc? Just hit them a few times and drag them off to the jail, please—”
“No, wait! Erin! It’s us! From Magnolia’s mansion!”
Joseph shouted as Relc walked over with fist raised. Erin blinked. And she remembered.
