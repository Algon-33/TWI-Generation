The half-Troll girl was tired, despite what Ryoka thought. She was sleepy as she leaned against the wagon, pushing it. So tired in fact that she kept drifting off, accounting for their slow progress back to Riverfarm. They were the last wagon. But they weren’t more than—
Durene yawned. She leaned against the wagon. Just for a second.
 
[Paladin Level 17!]
[Skill – Iron Skin obtained!]
 
“Huh?”
She opened her eyes. Ahead of her, Wiskeria, yawning, stood up and peered over her hat. She had a ball of [Light] and she raised it with one hand.
“Durene? You okay? We’ve stopped moving.”
The half-Troll girl yawned and stood up straighter. She smiled up at Wiskeria and saw the [Witch] smile too.
“I’m awake! Sorry, Wiskeria. I just drifted off. But guess what? I just leveled!”
“You did? That’s gr—”
“[Fast Fireball!]”
Durene heard the voice, but she didn’t understand it at first. Then there was a bright light. Wiskeria spun. She held up a hand—
And the fireball ­exploded, blowing her off the wagon. Durene threw up her hands and her ears rang. She stumbled backwards as a blast of heat washed over her.
“Wiskeria!”
 
Night 59 – Ryoka
 
Ryoka heard the voice. She saw the [Fireball] hit the wagon and explode. The passengers in front disappeared. So did Wiskeria. Bismarck roared as his fur caught fire. He rolled and pieces of wood rained down from the sky. The City Runner just stared.
“Wiskeria?”
“Ryoka!”
Someone grabbed her. Charlay. The Centauress was pointing. Ryoka turned. She saw another fiery ball of light. Her body moved faster than her mind. She and Charlay ran before the [Fireball] exploded five paces from where they’d been. Ryoka felt the heat.
And out of the night, they came. [Bandits]. They rode down on the City Runners and the destroyed wagons, loosing arrows, and the [Pyromancer] holding the staff shot a stream of flames that nearly cooked Ryoka. The wind saved her; it blew the flames up as Ryoka and Charlay split.
Over the ringing in her ears, Ryoka could hear the [Mage] shouting.
“Get the [Witch]! Get her hat! The hat’s worth gold! Kill the others!”
“Ryoka, run!”
Charlay shouted. There were [Riders] baring down at her. She turned, wide-eyed, as one lifted a sword. The Centauress bolted left. The [Pyromancer] saw and raised his staff.
“Charlay! Behind you!”
“Gyaaaah! [Spray Hoof]!”
A spray of dirt hit the [Pyromancer]. He swore and his spell missed. Fire flashed over Charlay’s head as half the [Bandits] went after her. There were—twelve? Not many. But the [Pyromancer]—
Ryoka saw Charlay racing away. She heard the Centauress’ voice.
“[Lightning Gallop]! [Duststorm Kick]!”
She took off. The [Bandits] following her ran into a dust storm. They halted, coughing. And the [Pyromancer] shook his staff.
“Ignore the horse! Get the wagon—”
Something flew at his head. He ducked and the Tripvine Bag exploded. The vines nearly knocked him from the saddle. He turned, snarling. The caltrop hit him in one eye.
“Durene!”
Ryoka screamed the words over the [Pyromancer]’s howl. She spun. The wind was howling. Dust and flying caltrops blew through the air. The [Bandits] riding down on her cursed as their horses reared and screamed.
The Runner screamed back. This could not be happening. Wiskeria! The passengers! Smoke was everywhere, but the front of the wagon was gone. Someone was screaming, caught in the flames. Ryoka couldn’t save them. The [Bandits] were on her.
“Kill the Runner!”
