Abebi sighed in relief. And Cara rose. The [Singer] of Terandria left the wagon to raucous cheers. Protecting her people. She smiled, putting on another mask.
And she was unreadable. Unscryable. She murmured.
“Fuck it all. Where are you, ‘batman’? I could use someone else to help me out.”

The Singer of Terandria was changing the continent. The world. Through song. She was already rich. Famous. But she was a [Singer].
She was no ruler. She had a lot of [Bodyguards].
Not an army. Perhaps the Queen of Pop had an army of fans.
But Ailendamus had an army equipped with armor and blades. And their ruler, His Glorious Majesty Itorin II, had ambitious plans. Glorious designs for the future of his kingdoms.
Terrible ones for his enemies.
He was reaching out to other nations, laying the groundwork for aggression. War between Terandrian kingdoms was not like other wars. They followed rules. Protocols, traditions—as important as law. Treaties were held sacred, pacts between kingdoms that could not be violated.
Until someone broke them, with a Skill, or with pure arrogance and might. One was broken now, along the northern border of the Kingdom of Kaliv.
Kaliv, the kingdom of mountains, small in total landmass, but occupying the mountains. A power of the region. But hungry for farmland, food to feed the [Griffin Riders] and giant rams they used and bred.
A grassland along the Tergil River had been used as one of Kaliv’s larger farms. It had been taken in a war, oh, two hundred years back.
Now, a party of [Mercenaries] led by a [Sword Captain] of Ailendamus set upon the village and farm. They moved fast, herding up the Level 34 [Farmer] and most of the people.
“By order of his Majesty Itorin II of Ailendamus, this land is forfeit!”
The [Sword Captain] bellowed. The [Farmer] protested, shouting as the fresh-harvested food was dragged out.
“You can’t do this! This is Kaliv’s land! It was taken in war and ratified by Treaty of Everdel! Her Majesty—”
The [Sword Captain] struck the [Farmer], knocking him back. The [Mercenaries] were fiddling with oil, flint and tinder.
“Ailendamus does not recognize that treaty any longer. Men! Eradicate this illegal farm.”
The [Farmer] paled. The [Mercenaries] were setting fire to the silos, the crops. If they burned it all, Kaliv would feel the pinch. Especially in war.
“You can’t do this! When the Griffin Queen—”
The [Sword Captain] leveled his sword. The [Farmer] froze as his family tried to pull him back. The leader of the [Mercenaries] glanced at the burning barn.
“Don’t make this harder, sir. We need not spill your blood today. This is just politics between kingdoms.”
He spoke curtly. The [Farmer] looked at the armed [Mercenaries] on horseback, the sword held by the high-level [Warrior], and wilted. The [Farmers] groaned as the flames began to lick up one silo. They were going to transport that food up the mountains! As King Itorin had surely known. That was enough food to feed the mountain-cities for a month!
The [Sword Captain] was glancing about. Even if the Griffin Queen, Novakya, sent her fliers, they would be away and racing through the forests before they could be caught. And the fire just needed to burn—
“Enough!”
A voice bellowed from above. The people on the ground looked up. The [Mercenaries] and their horses shouted in confusion as a blast of wind hit the burning buildings.
The fire flared—and then went out. The [Sword Captain] swore as, from overhead, dark shadows dropped out of the sky.
