Even in her ravening state, Fierre glanced at her father. He looked at Ryoka, hesitating. She waited. Her heart was racing. She remembered Fierre attacking her in the mansion. That had been terrifying. She knew how strong Fierre was. But Colfa was right here.
“Is it safe, Himilt?”
“Fierre wouldn’t turn you. Neither Colfa or I would allow it. And it’s not a simple process. But there’s something else. If she’s cured…”
Colfa started. Ryoka saw her eyes flicker to Fierre and then Ryoka. Himilt gave his wife another unspoken look. This one significant. He stared at Ryoka, hard.
“We’ll deal with what happens. Nothing…terribly…bad will happen to you, Miss Griffin. I don’t think from giving blood once. If the stories are true.”
That didn’t reassure Ryoka at all. But she nodded, tightly.
“Food.”
Fierre sat up. Colfa took Himilt’s place as he stepped back. He closed the door as Colfa held her daughter, struggling to keep Fierre back.
“Remember. Do not drink quickly. Slowly. Just enough to hold you until we find more blood.”
“What—what do I do?”
Colfa hesitated. She was unsure, Ryoka realized. Her family didn’t usually drink blood.
“When Himilt turned me…sit there. Bare your neck and tilt your head…yes. Fierre? Slowly.”
She relaxed her grip. Ryoka sat there, terrified, sensing Fierre sniffing.
“She’s…not that appetizing. I’m not hungry for her.”
The Vampire muttered. Ryoka stirred.
“Thanks.”
“It’s not that. It’s something…”
Fierre trailed off. She licked her lips. Her stomach growled.
“Can I really bite you, Ryoka?”
“Yes, Fierre. Go ahead. You’re hungry.”
The City Runner saw the Vampire hovering. Colfa was watching. And then—Fierre grabbed Ryoka’s neck. Gently. She bit. Ryoka gasped as she felt a sharp pain. Then nothing.
She cracked open one eye, unclenching her fists. Strange. Ryoka felt Fierre there. She even felt the sensation of pressure on her neck. Blood pumping…she heard her heart beating, rapidly. But no pain.
It felt—Ryoka felt a sensation run down her body.
Tingling. Ryoka twitched. She searched for pain, but there wasn’t any this time. Just an unbearable tingling. It felt good, actually. And it was intensifying.
Her head felt light. Ryoka sagged. Her head went blank. All she heard was the blood pounding in her head.
Huh. No wonder Vampires got away with this. They weren’t—weren’t like mosquitoes at all. Ryoka could do this forever. The tingling was turning into—she was drifting and—
“Serafierre, enough.”
A voice spoke at the edge of Ryoka’s hazy consciousness. A hand interrupted the drain, the unbearable, wonderful feeling.
Fierre pulled away with reluctance, licking her lips. Ryoka collapsed. The world went dark; she must have blanked out for a second because Fierre was helping her sit up.
“Ryoka? Thank you.”
The Vampire girl was alive. If anything, it was Ryoka who was pale and disoriented. Fierre offered Ryoka a healing potion. The young woman drank. She looked at her friend, watching her anxiously.
“I’m so glad.”
Ryoka reached out and grabbed Fierre. The Vampire felt the Human hug her, fiercely. Then Ryoka sat back. She took a drink from the healing potion.
Then she passed out. At last—
She could rest.

But the world was changed for it.
They rode away in silence. Dawil kept glancing at Ylawes. At last, the Dwarf broke the silence.
“Alight, lad. You’ve never acted like that before. You always ask for permission before doing that well-thingy. And most [Mayors] are happy to let you. But what in the name of the Grandfather’s beards was that?”
