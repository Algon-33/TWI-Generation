Rags glanced at Lord Pellmia. She could spot Gilam among the tired Humans. He looked miserable, which made her feel better. She emptied her bowl—she was hungry!—and stood, stretching. The Goblins of her tribe watched her. She looked at them and they nodded.
There was something in their gazes that had changed these last few days. No, these last weeks. She had led them against the Humans, fought off Bethal’s knights, defeated the [Emperor]. Led them. Pyrite was right. Now, more than ever, she was their Chieftain. It felt strange. Rags felt large, despite her small body.
And hot. She glanced about irritably. Had someone dumped all the spices in one pot again? No—it was the fire. She fanned herself and decided to walk out of range of the heat. Pyrite noticed.
“Hot?”
“From fire.”
Rags pointed north. Pyrite looked around and frowned.
“Fire? All fires downwind.”
“No. Fire there—”
Rags turned and stopped. Her finger was pointing north, towards the mountain. But there was no cook fire in front of her. But the heat was real. The heat and the sense that there was a…a fire nearby.
Slowly, Pyrite stood. He looked around and frowned. He sniffed the air, checked the direction of the wind. Then he looked at Rags.
“Something, Chieftain.”
“Yes.”
“Something north. I feel too.”
“You do?”
Confused, Rags glanced up at Pyrite. He nodded and squinted north.
“Brightness. Stars. Glowing gem. North.”
That wasn’t what Rags felt. She frowned.
“I feel fire.”
“Fire? No. Bright light. Like in dark tunnels far underground. See light.”
“No, fire. Hey, Redscar!”
Rags turned and waved her hands. Redscar looked up from feeding Thunderfur. He jogged over. Rags pointed north.
“Feel something? North?”
The Goblin frowned. He cast about, scratched his head, and then paused. Slowly, he nodded.
“Feels like…mountain. Like High Passes north.”
“High Passes?”
Rags glanced south, towards the actual High Passes, the eternal, gigantic mountain range. Redscar frowned as he tried to explain.
“Like tall mountain. Like…like stair up and see high mountain. Over there.”
He pointed. There was a mountain that way. Dwarfhalls Rest. But it was a lot smaller than any of the mountains of the High Passes. Barely more than a giant hill, really. Rags glanced around and then realized something.
All the Goblins could sense it. They were eating, chattering, or just lying down to sleep. But somehow, they were all facing north. And they kept glancing north, idly, as if looking for something.
And now Rags could feel it for a certainty. There was a burning north of her. A fire. But she could only see the empty grass, rocks, the road, and the black horizon line north of her. She frowned.
“Something that way. But what?”
Rags stared north. The wind blew in her hair, and a bit of dirt. She cursed and wiped her eyes. She was about to order Redscar to send a few riders north—then she remembered that the Humans would probably stop the Goblins. She glared at the black horizon line. And then she frowned.
Was the horizon…getting larger? It seemed that way. On the edge of vision, where the sky and land mixed, the world was black. But the black line was getting larger. And now the wind was blowing south and Rags felt more grit blowing into her face. She cursed, turned her head and felt it.
Fire. Her head turned back. And then she saw it. The line was moving. And it was no line in the sand. It was a bunch of bodies. Bodies wearing black armor.
