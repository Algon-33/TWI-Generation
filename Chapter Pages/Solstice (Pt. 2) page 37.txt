Solstice (Pt. 2)
Page 37
A shadow, a memory, a thing crept into the garden at last. And looked up towards the hill. It crept forwards.
How sad. How terrible. There was no one here to say its name. No hand to take. But a body? A body would do.
The young woman lay on the top of the hill, surrounded by statues.
Tragedy. Despite all you did, look how you died, Erin Solstice.
You failed. You were not strong enough. Look. You’ve fallen and now they were coming for you. All you wrought would wear away.
You have fallen.
“…But you are not alone.”
The figure sat on the hilltop. His eyes were crimson. His skin was green. He looked down at the intruder.
The Goblin Lord sighed. Reiss rose. The figure stopped. A little ghost? It crept further, undeterred. It was more than a single ghost.
The ___ of the Forgotten, the First of the Lost, the Furthest Traveller, ________ ____…
Stopped.
An army stood in front of him and the vessel. Their eyes glowed crimson. Their skin was green.
Goblins.
Headscratcher looked left, at Bugear. His eyes traced the gaps in their number. Statues. Ghosts floating in place where their representations in stone should be.
Grunter. Orangepoo. So many were missing statues, memorials. Because she had not known them. But where the statues were missing—the Goblins stood. Or sat. Grunter waved. Orangepoo nodded, slightly miffed that Headscratcher got a statue.
Bugear rubbed at his ears, disconcerted to find nothing there. He looked ahead. Spiderslicer checked his side. Eater of Spears looked ahead.
Reiss looked left. And Garen Redfang rested a clawed hand on his shoulder.
“Why are we here?”
He looked blankly at his brother. Reiss didn’t know how to explain.
It was just a thought. If. If Shorthilt had—and Pyrite? Then perhaps…the Goblins looked down at the stranger in their midst.
“Because you are needed. For one last fight. Brother.”
The Goblin Lord rose. He took Garen’s shoulder. The Chieftain half shook his head.
“We had one chance. Should not have a second.”
He harrumphed, as if annoyed by the fact of existing. Reiss bared his teeth.
“Don’t be stupid. This…”
He pointed down at the shadow in the air.
“Must stop it. It will steal her.”
He looked at the young woman. Headscratcher knelt in front of her. He reached for her, gently. But his hands passed through her. He bowed his head. Then he looked up. His comrades clustered around him, so curious to see the strange Human.
“Like flowers.”
That was all Grunter said. The others nodded. Headscratcher looked up and wiped at his eyes. But there were no tears.
“It is coming.”
Reiss warned the others. The lost thing was coming up the hill. Garen reached for his side. But he had no sword.
“Redscar took.”
Spiderslicer. Garen grimaced.
“Good.”
Below them, the thing was angry. At the Goblins who stood in its way. Small and large! Cave Goblins, large Hobs. Redfangs, Flooded Plains Goblins. All those that Numbtongue had ever met or known.
Waiting for him. Those damned things.
Stubborn even in death. They did not remember the whole of it. But somehow, someway. They still fulfilled their oaths.
“Brother. We must hold it back until this day ends.”
“Good thing its longest day.”
Reiss half-laughed. Eater of Spears rumbled as it made a fist.
“We have no weapons.”
“So? You dead. Still coward?”
Spiderslicer poked him in the side. The big Goblin glared. But then he looked down.
“Weapons useless anyways.”
The Goblins nodded. They walked down the hill. The thing was coming up. But it would not reach her before the day ended.
