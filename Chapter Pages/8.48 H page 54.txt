Klbkchhezeim’s mandibles were so far open they were in danger of detaching from his face. Wrymvr waved the scrying orb.
“See? He has your sword art. See? Mockery intensifies.”
“That—that is my sword style.”
“Obviously.”
Klbkch’s mandibles clacked together.
“But that is—my sword style! He cannot inherit it! That is mine!”
“He has inherited it. Well done. Well done.”
“My sword style! I owned that Skill! He can’t just—”
Klbkch stared at the image of the Antinium’s greatest thief, walking off into Chandrar’s night. With his Skills. Wrymvr waved the scrying orb around until Klbkch burst free of his restraints and kicked it into the ceiling.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: Hugqough. Will you laugh at me if I told you I thought it would be…almost exactly 7,000 words shorter?
Ahem. At least this is in two parts. This is Ksmvr’s arc, which I had originally planned to be one edited chapter. But while it could have used some patching up, the truth is this was an adventure, and the edited chapter, which I hope to release soon, is a bit more complex on some levels.
…Well, both shoot for the moon. I hope you enjoyed this chapter. The clues were there, but I never saw anyone figure out what [Her—] stood for. Well, it’s hard to see the entire puzzle when all you get is one of those squiggly pieces that’s not even an edge-piece.
Hope you enjoyed! I am going to rest, and relax…and write even more! But depending on what happens, I may release just the edited chapter if I can do it all before Tuesday. Fingers crossed, but if I do—it’s even longer than this one. Thanks for reading!
