Like people who insist on watching horror movies. It’s a happy compromise and sending Hedag seems like the safest bet. I hear more sighing from Agratha’s lot. And once again, Emperor Laken has steered the rocky course of negotiations!
Huzzah. I stretch. I want to eat something.
Anyways. Creepy little girls, even if they are horrifying, aren’t the biggest thing Riverfarm has to deal with. If you want to deal with real problems—well—the next day was even more of a headache.
Goblins are good at giving me headaches. I think they enjoy making trouble for me.

“Where do I even begin? There’s too much to say…where are you, I guess? Can I ask that? Or is it…dangerous?”
“It might be. But this is the only way we can talk. The safest way…well, how confident are you?”
“Um. S-six?”
“Six?”
That wasn’t Elena’s voice. Ryoka stared at Palt accusingly. He shrugged.
“The Elusive Lot.”
He whispered back. Elena was arguing with someone on the other side.
“You are all listening in!”
“We’re keeping the spell active! You want to chat on an unsecured spell? We could get you a decent artifact, I guess.”
“Well? Will you?”
“But we want to listen in!”
The argument between Elena and an unknown speaker—Palt was writing ‘Galei’ as Galina frantically transcribed—ended in the background. Galina had experience in transcribing, apparently. Erin was resting her hands on her chin, just staring.
“That’s one of the Elusive Lot. Do you know about…?”
“Yes. I’m um—allied with Ullsinoi. We are.”
“We? There are more of you?”
“Yes.”
Ryoka Griffin, aka ‘batman’, was sweating. Elena made a sound.
“I—maybe don’t tell me?”
“The Elusive Lot knows. I’d rate this as a six out of ten myself. But we have to try. Let’s keep anything extremely important secret. But I can tell you we have a safe place. In Izril. In…”
Ryoka looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] shrugged. Ryoka still hesitated.
“—In Izril. If we could get you out, we’d bring you here.”
“How safe is ‘safe’? We’ve heard how bad it is—I saw some terrible stuff myself. Not all of its bad, but I saw…monsters…and Cara—the [Popstar]—she showed me a text chat that apparently happened before I arrived. That’s how we know you. Some people…”
“Yeah. I know. You know…‘asdf’? The…”
Imani flinched. Ryoka chose her words carefully. Elena made a sound.
“I think so.”
“It was Crelers. The—survivor’s with us.”
“Oh. Oh my god—we’ve found more people who survived monster attacks, but you found…? Some people have horrible stories—”
“We have to stay on topic. Sorry, but I know we’re on a time limit.”
Palt nodded. Elena took a breath.
“Okay. You’re in Izril. Got it. Um—there are things we should tell you. I don’t know what you know. But first? Listen—do you have a scrying orb?”
“Yes. We’ve seen all the broadcasts, including the Singer—Cara’s?—video.”
“Ah, right. Well, she’s telling you important things. You caught that, right?”
“Ailendamus, Wistram, er…[Necromancers]? Seek safety with Noelictus, Calanfer, half-Elves, Dwarves? Just in general?”
“There’s only one major Dwarf settlement in the world. And the half-Elves—well, Cara knows some. Yeah. Good. I knew you’d get it. I got it at once, and Cara and I can’t talk. It’s too dangerous.”
“So Wistram is keeping you all hostage? You can’t communicate?”
“Someone’s always listening if we talk. They want Cara to come to Wistram—and no, we can’t leave. We’re told we’ll be able to once Wistram has ‘control of the situation’. But…she asked for volunteers and I came here.”
“Who?”
“Oh, Cara, sorry. She has more Earthers and she was suspicious of Wistram. I volunteered…”
