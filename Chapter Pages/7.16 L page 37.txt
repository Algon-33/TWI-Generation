The light smashed him into a wall. Xrn conjured it, a prismatic ray that hurled Klbkch across the ground. Pawn, bleeding, fell to his knees.
“Klbkchhezeim. You are lost.”
Xrn, the Small Queen, stood looking down on the torn, broken body. She looked at Pawn. At Klbkch. And she shook her head.
“You despair. You forget. Look at you. You would slay the only good thing you have made. You would become what they call you. Klbkch the Slayer. But that is not who you are.”
She raised her staff. Klbkch looked up. And he saw her.
One of the last. Her body unchanged. Azure. Her eyes glowing with a mystery lost to this world. With love. Another, who remembered. Xrn smiled. With pity. Kindness. Anger, yes. But—her voice was kind.
“You have worked so hard, alone, dear Klbkchhezeim. Rest now. You have delivered us hope.”
She lifted her staff. Pawn stared. He felt magic touching him. Magic, not miracles. But—the green lifeblood running from him halted. He saw Xrn point her staff up.
The ceiling fell on Klbkch. The Small Queen shook her head.
“Fool.”
The earth moved. Klbkch was thrown out of it, at her feet. He stared at her. His voice was—cracked. Disbelieving.
“But you see. Look at him, Xrn. lOoK aT HI—”
She smacked him with her staff. Klbkch shut up. Xrn shook her head. She gestured at Pawn.
“Look at what? Our enemy? Can you not see the difference? I see with eyes not filled with despair or frustration, Klbkchhezeim. And I see something new. The past remains in Rhir, Klbkch. But this? This is glorious. Let us use the new to carve a path back to our home.”
“But they are—”
Whack. Another hit from the staff.
“Insubordinate? When did you turn into Wrymvr? Look at you. You despair, and see only shadows. But look. Look at the sun!”
She pointed her staff up. And Pawn saw a light. So brilliant it ate every shadow. Fire. It rose above Xrn, a second sun underground. The Small Queen spread her arms. And Pawn saw a miracle of another kind.
“Do not despair, Klbkchhezeim of the Centenium. Not now. We are so close. And you have done it. You are lost. But I will help you find yourself. We all will. You are no longer alone.”
The Antinium pointed. And the second of the True Antinium looked at her old comrade. And he felt it.
The broken insect looked up. And he heard the sound. Marching feet. The beating of wings. Armor, moving. You couldn’t hear the soundless ones.
But there they were. Antinium. They marched into the barracks. Columns of them. And Klbkch saw the first, adorned in armor, and realized—he hadn’t seen Tersk or Dekass lately, had he?
But there they were. The Armored Antinium marched into the barracks, a full hundred. Led by Tersk and Dekass. They knelt. And flying around them, above them in a chaos were flying shapes. Gliding, jumping. Pivr and the Flying Antinium alighted and chittered in delight.
At their side were shadows. A smaller group of Silent Antinium stood, camouflaged, led by a single Prognugator. The Antinium knelt and bowed.
Three Hives. No—four. More Prognugators. Guards, fashioned by the Grand Queen herself, in his likeness. They saluted him with blades made of chitin, four.
Wrong again. Five Hives.
Klbkch jerked. The voice in his head was familiar. It was—Xrn. She stared at him, and her eyes flashed. A wink. He was confused—and she put the answer into his mind.
There they came. Marching among the new, staring. But the other Antinium stared at them. The Painted Antinium, led by Yellow Splatters. By Anand, Belgrade, Garry, Purple Smiles, even Bird.
