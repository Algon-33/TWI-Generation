The two Gentlemen Callers were looking at Teor. Crimshaw looked about him.
“…More than a fellow could ask for. This—”
He didn’t finish his sentence. He didn’t need to. The Brothers of Serendipitous Meetings looked around. Good fellows. Bad men. They lived well, they were able to sleep most nights.
But they would die forgotten, but for the other short-lived people who remembered them.
Except here was immortality. A bit of forever. Erin Solstice stood on the hill for a while. And she wondered if the first person to gain this Skill, the Harpy [Empress]—had made this place.
Surely, she had. She had been like Erin, in that. The [Innkeeper] saw one last statue, as she turned to go. Then she did start crying.
Tritel stood on the hill, his gloves dangling from one hand. He looked content. But he was waiting. And the longer the better. But someday—his friend would be here too.

Look upon her. She had led more Goblins to death than Garen Redfang, his old Chieftain. She had asked Humans, Drakes, Gnolls, and more to die for her.
They would not have done it if she didn’t care. Badarrow was still shaking from his encounter with the hill.
He stood in the Garden, far below. Amid mortality. That hilltop could tear your heart to pieces if you stayed. It was terrifying. Wondrous. But terrifying.
In the inn, Numbtongue was listening to Drassi trying to copy a riff. He was grinning—but ducked out as a crowd of admirers drew around, wanting to try the guitar.
Like the other Goblins, he wasn’t at home with so many…other species. Even now, he still felt like Badarrow. A sense that but for Erin, they might have been enemies.
Were there daggers behind the Earl’s smile? Badarrow stayed in the Garden as Numbtongue trudged over.
“Erin went up to the hill?”
“Mm.”
The [Sniper] grunted. He didn’t need to talk with Numbtongue. The [Bard] was chatty—perhaps because he had not recently been in the company of other Goblins.
“Chieftain will want to see hill.”
“Yes.”
Numbtongue stirred. He looked at his old friend. His brother-in-arms. But time had changed them.
Snapjaw. Numbtongue’s posture had been by turns, amazed, happy for Badarrow. And faintly, envious. Badarrow understood, of course, and it was just the shadow.
“Erin not changed.”
That was all Badarrow said. Numbtongue looked up at her, lost on that hill in the mists.
“No. She’s changed a lot. Fire and…lot changed. Garden. See?”
Badarrow nodded. But for once, the Goblin communication network had lost his true meaning.
“Yes. But not changed. Here.”
He tapped his breast. Numbtongue looked at him.
“No. True.”
They looked back up.
“Will you come with to Goblinhome?”
The [Bard] stirred. He looked at Badarrow.
“Maybe. For bit. But this…will you stay?”
“No.”
Badarrow knew it to be true. Numbtongue’s face fell. Badarrow looked at him.
“Erin does not need…me. Lots of Antinium. Scary blue-death one. Adventurers. She does not need…us.”
He meant himself and Snapjaw. It hurt, a bit. For the days when there were just five Redfangs—Badarrow would have traded so much. If only you could make the past the same as today and take the best of both.
“Yes. Does not need…”
“She needs you.”
Badarrow looked at Numbtongue. The [Bard] blinked. But that too was true. Not Badarrow, but Numbtongue. The [Sniper] looked at his friend.
“Shorthilt. Pyrite.”
He reached out and touched Numbtongue’s chest. The [Soulbard] closed his eyes.
“Yes.”
“Good.”
