He was Knight-Commander Calirn. And Talia normally expected him to be fulfilling some duty of command, which was often pressing, such as speaking with a monarch, or seeing to an argument between the Seasons. But as she strode into the center of the keep, she heard a clamor.
Talia saw an [Autumn Knight], dressed in robes rather than armor, sprinting past her. And Talia, born to action, took off following. Because the other woman was running straight into the heart of the cathedral that was the domain of the Knight-Commander.
“Where is the Knight-Commander? I have a [Message] for him!”
“In the War Room!”
A [Servant] answered, wide-eyed as the [Autumn Knight] shouted at her. The young woman ran left, and Talia overtook her. She knew the location by heart, and burst into one of the central war rooms at the same time as the [Autumn Knight]. She blinked as she threw open the grand double doors and felt the freezing around her. She exhaled and saw a cloud of vapor—and a man, standing in cold, grey and pale blue clothing next to a pair of shivering [Servants]. He turned and looked up.
“Dame Talia?”
“Knight-Commander Calirn!”
The [Autumn Knight] stopped, and shivered. Calirn blinked, and seemed to notice the cold in the room. He did nothing, but Talia felt the air warming. She was unaffected; her armor was still warm despite the cold, but the two [Servants] and [Autumn Knight] relaxed at once. Calirn nodded to Talia and then promptly ignored her.
“You have another report, Dame Wera?”
The Fall Knight nodded, breathless.
“I have, Knight-Commander. The [Message] came to our Order through our general receiver, not—”
She gestured to one of the [Servants], who was holding a magical scroll that could be used to facilitate communications more smoothly. Calirn frowned.
“Why? We were in communication with the [Broker] directly. What has changed?”
“[Broker]?”
Talia blinked. The Order of Season was speaking with a [Broker]? But she listened as the [Autumn Knight] shook her head and searched for words.
“Dead, Knight-Commander Calirn. He’s dead.”
The Knight-Commander’s pale grey eyes focused on the [Autumn Knight]. And the chill that emanated from him was biting. Intense. Talia had known Knight-Commander Calirn for years, if not personally. She had seldom seen him like this. He was a Knight of the Winter, of course. He spoke one word.
“How?”
“A curse, Knight-Commander. Apparently, the man was found with his tongue stitched—to the roof of his mouth. His nose was sewn shut and he died—”
One of the [Servants] made a faint sound. Talia put her hand on her sword uneasily. What was this? Calirn’s expression darkened.
“Then it may well be her. Or one of her ruses to distract the hunters on her trail. Was there anything else?”
The [Autumn Knight] shook her head.
“No, Knight-Commander. Just a request for gold. It was one of his associates that sent the message—”
“Did they say where the Stitch Witch was? Did they confirm the rumor?”
“No. They didn’t.”
The woman shook her head again. Calirn said nothing, but his expression was thunderous. And Talia started.
The Stitch Witch? The name was familiar. Then Calirn spoke.
“Belavierr. This has her magic about it. But if no one can confirm it was actually her, then it could be another one of her thousand misdirections.”
And then it hit Talia. She looked at Calirn as wide-eyed as the [Autumn Knight]. The female [Knight] reached up for her spectacles that had fallen off her nose in her run here.
“The Stitch Witch herself. Belavierr. Could it really be her, Knight-Commander?”
“Perhaps.”
