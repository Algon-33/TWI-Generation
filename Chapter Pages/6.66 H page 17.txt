“Run. You must run, Yvlon. And live. I will be happy. You have given me everything I never knew I wanted.”
The words made Yvlon flinch. She looked at him. Slowly, Yvlon reached out with her good arm as the other hand held the sword, resting it in the mud. Yvlon touched him.
“You have to go, Ksmvr.”
“No.”
He stared at her, shocked. Yvlon Byres smiled weakly. She placed her hand on his chest.
“You can make it. My quick [Skirmisher]. My friend. I can’t.”
“No. I must die. You must live.”
She shook her head. Montressa was screaming defiance as the adventurers fled, moving towards the edge of the barrier shielding them. The adult was screaming too. It wanted them. It was done playing. Yvlon touched her chest with her fingers.
“I’m sorry. But not again. There’s nothing left here—”
She touched at her right arm with her left. Then the holes in her body. She felt nothing, but she saw them, leaking blood.
“I’m broken, Ksmvr. There’s no fixing this. Or this. You have to go.”
“I must stay. I cannot lose you.”
Yvlon smiled.
“If you stay, I stay. I won’t leave.”
“But if you remain, I must stay too. Please run away. You mean more to me than my life. Please?”
What an impasse. What terrible, twisted love. Yvlon reached out. She hugged Ksmvr, as tightly as she could. The magic flickered overhead.
“I’m sorry. But I love you too. I guess we’re both too stubborn. Watch my back until I fall, then.”
“…Please?”
She let go. Yvlon turned. So did Ksmvr. They looked back, at two distant figures. Montressa screamed as she lifted her staff.
“Ceria! Pisces!”
She whirled. And there she stood. Montressa du Valeross. Mons.
A [Mage] of Wistram.
A young girl who had fallen a tiny bit in love, until it turned to betrayal. A fellow student.
A child afraid of the undead.
A friend.
She pointed at them. Ceria was bleeding from one temple. She wiped the blood away from her head and looked up. The Creler was smashing downwards. Below it, Yvlon and Ksmvr stood together.
Yvlon was picking up something. She unfurled the scroll and Ksmvr turned.
“Run.”
They all shouted it. The barrier came down and Montressa collapsed. Ksmvr ran past her. He leapt into the oncoming ranks of Crelers, kicking, slashing.
Yvlon was reading the scroll with one hand. Ceria saw a flash of magic. Yvlon straightened and she grinned.
[Lion’s Strength]. She lifted the broken, heavy blade and charged the adult. Montressa was looking back. She mouthed the word again.
Ceria saw Gerial’s face. She looked up and saw Skinner. The adult Creler was ignoring Yvlon, watching the other adventurers. Walt, laying about him with two of his teammates. Alais, slumped on the ground, dying, as her team tried to protect their leader. A Gnoll, fighting alone with a bent sword and buckler. The adult opened its mouth and the Gnoll vanished.
Fifteen left. The adult was counting. A Drake ran. She’d fought the entire time, and her daggers had broken in a Creler’s spine. Now, she was hundreds of feet distant, time bought by Montressa. Running for the door. The adult Creler opened its mouth. The Drake cried out.
Vanished.
Fourteen. Sick, Ceria looked up at the adult. It didn’t want to let any of them go. None of them could leave. Except Ksmvr. Except—
The half-Elf raised her wand. Pisces was on his feet, panting. He was drinking his last potion, a stamina potion, with one hand, shaking. His rapier trailed in the mud. He looked up as the air froze.
