“Now we come to it, your Majesty! Now we put an end to this pathetic performance. I should have done this years ago!”
He shouts. The courtyard is still. There are a hundred bows trained on the Fool, [Mages] ready with spells, warriors with blades. None of them dare move. Because the knife at the Blighted King’s throat is faster than them all.
The Blighted King stands still. His voice is calm.
“Do it, then, traitor. But tell me why, first. You pledged your loyalty to me, to this nation. Why betray it?”
“Why? Why?”
The Fool is trembling. His hands still smoke. There are tears in his voice, but none in his eyes. I can see Erille, standing with her hands on her mouth next to Isodore. The Fool can’t look at her. A tableau.
“Why do you think? All you’ve done, all the horrors you’ve committed, the crimes—I could understand. That, for war. But the ritual? The cost? Never.”
“What I do, I do for my people. So that they may live.”
The Fool shakes his head. His dagger presses into the King’s throat, drawing blood. I hear a sound from the Blighted Queen. Pain.
“You do not deserve to be a King. Tell them what you did. Tell them!”
“No. Kill me. But I will die first.”
The Fool hesitates. The Blighted King is ready to impale himself on the dagger before either one speaks. I can see him looking, staring at Erille, hand tensing on the hilt—
“My turn.”
Everyone turns as I stand, brushing myself off. The Fool looks at me. I’m not sure if he hates me, even now.
“There’s nothing you can do, Tom. Step away. The Blighted King dies, and I die too. Let that be an end to it.”
“Oh, come on. It’s not over. You’re here, Fool, and so am I. We can’t let it end with you dying just like that. We need a final grudge match, a proper end. [Fool] vs [Clown]. A battle for the ages. What do you say?”
He stares at me. I grin at him. He looks away.
“You truly are mad, aren’t you? You…I’m sorry. Sorry you ever came here, Tom.”
“Don’t say that. Tell you what; I’ll make you an offer you can’t refuse.”
There are two knives in my hand. I have three left. The Fool stares at me.
“You can’t scare me with death. I’m ready for it.”
I roll my eyes.
“Not your death, obviously. I’m thinking more poetically.”
I look past the Blighted King, past the Fool. At a girl staring with wide eyes. The Fool’s mouth opens. He screams.
“No!”
The knife flies past the Blighted King, through the air, towards Erille. Too fast for anyone to block. Anyone, but a Fool.
He lets the Blighted King go and dives for the knife. I’ve never seen a man move that fast. The Fool catches the blade in midair, right in front of Erille’s face. Of course, I knew he’d do that.
That’s why I threw three.
The Fool’s hands blur as he throws all three knives. Two fly towards the Blighted King, striking him in the chest, and in the shoulder. The next one strikes me in the stomach. It doesn’t slow me down as I tackle the [Fool]. We roll around on the ground, hands flashing, fighting for daggers, pulling them out of the air, out of each other’s trick spaces.
“You idiot! You mad monster!”
He screams at me as he slashes my face, my arms and front. I laugh, stabbing back. He dodges, even locked together as we are. He kicks me away and we stand. I throw a dagger, his dagger, and he throws it right back. I snatch it out of the air and we cut at each other, dodging, weaving, too close for anyone to interfere.
“Why do you do it? Why!?”
He’s shouting, stumbling. His hands don’t grasp the knives properly. I laugh.
“Do you want to know why? Do you know what separates the two of us? Clown and fool? It’s easy!”
