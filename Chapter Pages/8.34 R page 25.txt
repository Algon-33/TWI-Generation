He had never heard of a [Guardsman] shouting at a frightened little girl for nearly an hour, threatening to put her in the overnight cells, and cuffing her until Relc arrived. Hickery had been sobbing—silently because she’d been told to be silent—but burst into tears anew when he walked in.
“I…I’m sorry.”
When Relc finally emerged, the parents greeted him. Hickery was still crying, but clinging to both. Relc’s head hung low. His tail dragged on the ground.
“It’s not your fault, [Guardsman] Relc. We heard what you did today.”
“What? Oh yeah. The gang. I didn’t—this [Guard] hauled Hickery in because he saw her practicing. I…know him.”
Pos. Relc tried to explain. He found he didn’t need to.
“It’s not the first time it’s happened. It won’t be the last. I’m just glad Hickery wasn’t arrested and you were here, Senior Guardsman.”
Orell tried to smile, but he was angry. Who wouldn’t be? He glanced into the Watch House, still loud with internal commotion. He stood up.
“Let’s go home.”
“I’ll walk with you. I—I’m sorry, Hickery.”
“I didn’t do anything wrong!”
She cried. Her parents carried her in silence. Relc stared back at the Watch House.
“No. You didn’t.”
How could you be up so high and then low in a moment, like that? He felt as if he’d been standing on clouds and someone had yanked the flying carpet out from under him.
Pos. But not just Pos. Orell and Maxireffa were silent until they were two blocks outside the Watch House. Then they began speaking.
“It really isn’t your fault, Senior Guardsman. A child with a weapon…”
“It’s a training spear.”
“Nevertheless. It’s happened. Hickery will just have to not practice. Or do it out of sight.”
“But it’s the courtyard! I have to…”
The little girl was sniffing and crying. Relc couldn’t look at her. He glanced at Orell. The Gnoll was shaking his head.
“It will be fine. She’s a [Spear Trainee], isn’t she?”
He glanced at Relc. The Drake ducked his head again.
“Yeah. Talented as I’ve seen.”
“Then that’s wonderful. Hickery might have a future as…well. A lot of things. I don’t like to imagine her fighting, but a good class is a good class. Skills are Skills. This? It’ll work out. Maybe it’s time to move again, Maxy.”
She nodded. Hickery clung to her mother.
“I don’t want to go! I like it here!”
She shouted it, despite everything. Heads turned, and some people called out to Relc. He tried to smile and couldn’t.
“I don’t know what to say.”
He tried to apologize again, but Maxireffa shook her head.
“It wasn’t your fault, Guardsman Relc. We are used to it. It will all shake out in the levels in the end.”
Relc blinked. Orell nodded.
“What comes down brings you up in time. Hickery, why don’t we buy you a little treat? We have to celebrate your class anyways.”
“Really?”
She sniffed. Relc instantly fished in his money pouch.
“I can give…”
He realized he didn’t have much; taking down the Shank Gang hadn’t come with a monetary reward. The two Gnoll parents waved it away.
“We can’t thank you enough. Hickery’s level…don’t worry about it, please.”
The Drake reluctantly tucked away the light pouch. He glanced at Maxireffa.
“That was the Book of Levels you were quoting, wasn’t it?”
“It was. Hardship lets us level. It’s a source of comfort, sometimes. And it will turn out for the best. We’ll outlevel anyone who steps on us.”
Relc nodded. And yet…he glanced over his shoulder. Shook his head.
“That wasn’t right. A Senior Guardsman…”
His fist clenched. Orell tried to smile, but his look was one of resignation. He glanced at Relc.
