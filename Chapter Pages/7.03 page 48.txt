General Duln’s face drained of the last of its color. The [Soldiers], the Watch—they felt it.
Mortal terror.
It swept around the world. War. The Grand Queen looked at Xrn. The Centenium was frozen. And in his inn, Klbkch rose. His hands touched the hilts of his swords. And Zevara gripped her hilt.
The Twisted Antinium roared. The Armored Queen swept herself up. The Flying Antinium’s wings beat. And the Free Queen looked at Bird. He stood there, and cheerfully shouted down at Grimalkin. And Erin realized what he was doing.
Too late. If the Horns had been there—but no. Bird spread his arms. All four of them. One held his bow, another an arrow. He basked in the sun as it shone down on him, all arms spread. Like a dark angel. A harbinger of Armageddon. He knew no fear.
“I am Bird! Prognugator of the Free Antinium! I am unique! There are many Antinium, but the death of a Prognugator means war! Or do you not know of Klbkch the Slayer? Xrn the Small Queen? We are second only to our Queens! And I am Prognugator! I forget the rest! So tell me, is it war?”
He screamed the words. And Erin realized Bird was bluffing. Bluffing, happily repeating Ksmvr’s lie. But it was such a spectacular lie that it wasn’t. The Antinium waited. The nations stared at Bird.
Bird pointed down at Grimalkin.
“I am Bird. Prognugator. Yes. And I hunt birds. I am a [Bird Hunter]. See?”
He pointed down at the Wyvern. And he looked at Erin. She saw him twitch an antenna in a ‘wink’. Chaldion stared up at Bird.
“A hunting Prognugator? One designed for anti-air attacks?”
Dragonspeaker Luciva whispered.
“It brought down Wyverns. With a bow. I didn’t think—is this what they’ve been developing? I have to change my plans.”
Az’kerash stared.
“The Prognugator of the Free Antinium. A new one. No—a new Centenium.”
Ilvriss was closing his eyes. He was trying not to laugh. Or cry.
“Bird the Hunter.”
Someone whispered it in Pallass. Erin looked up at Bird. She looked at Grimalkin’s twitching jaw, the ranks of silent [Soldiers]. She just wanted to go home. Could she redo today?
In The Wandering Inn, Klbkch felt every eye settle on him. Even the Antinium. No—especially Prognugator Tersk and Dekass. The Armored Antinium stared, suspicious. Klbkch slowly nodded. He tried his most sincere, slow tone.
“For the record…the Free Antinium do not have a program developing new Prognugators. Bird is not a Prognugator. He is lying.”
Klbkch looked about. He met every staring eye. And he realized no one in the entire world was going to believe him.
