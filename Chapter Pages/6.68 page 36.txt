The skeleton’s hands tightened around Erin Solstice’ throat. She choked. And the words never came out. Toren stared down as Erin’s eyes went wide. Her chest convulsed. She tried to throw him off her.
He choked her. Strangling her. His grip was weak. His body fragile. Light as bones. But no matter how much she tore at his grip, broke his bones, shattered his skull—
He wouldn’t let go.
“—”
Silence. She was like him now. Toren saw Erin’s mouth opening. Closing. She struck him. But she couldn’t break him.
Toren waited. He felt her legs kicking, but he was kneeling on her chest. Erin’s fists flailed on his body. Still—he waited. Ready to roll. The golden ring. Someone from Liscor.
Anything.
But nothing came. Erin did nothing. Her eyes were wide, locking on his. Fluttering. Blood filled her eyes. She was trying to say something.
He wished he could understand her. The skeleton’s grip tightened.
Once. Erin convulsed, her fist struck Toren’s chest as she punched up. Too weakly. But—Toren looked around. Erin’s arms fell.
Where was it coming from? What spot? Who? What?
But nothing moved. And Toren realized nothing was coming. She had nothing left. He stared down.
No one would stop him. No one but himself. The skeleton looked down at his hands.
They never loosened. Erin Solstice’s mouth fell open.
Her hand rose.
 
Fell.
 
 
Her legs went still.
 
 
 
 
Her eyes opened wide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
She stopped moving.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Erin Solstice inhaled with a gasp. Air flooded into her lungs. She jerked—trying to move, her mind fragmented. Thoughts spinning. What? Where—
She sat up. Her lungs were burning. Her throat rasped, her windpipe broken—
She felt at her throat. It was whole. And the pain in her body—gone. Erin looked around.
And she saw him.
“Toren?”
Her voice rasped. The skeleton was standing in the sun. Staring up at the sky. He made no move as Erin shakily got to her feet.
It hadn’t worked. Even at the end, he hadn’t hurt her. He couldn’t hurt her, only kill her. And if she died—if she died, what was the point?
Nothing. He had lived without her, once. And that was enough. Toren turned his head back from the sun. He looked at Erin.
But living was worse. She didn’t love him. She hated him. To her, he was just a thing. That was why he had left her to die. That was why he hated her.
“Toren.”
She spoke his name. She looked at him. Maybe—maybe—the skeleton saw the fading marks around Erin’s throat, still healing from the potion.
No. Anything could have happened. But no more. The future he’d been chasing vanished. And the skeleton grinned a mirthless grin.
He saw it all so clearly. The folly of his creation. His damned, worthless life. Toren raised his hands. He looked at Erin. And he did what he should have done long ago. A minute too late, now. Toren placed his hands together, curving them. And Erin stopped.
It was not one of Mrsha’s sign-words, or part of any language. But it was universal. Something even Erin could understand. She looked at Toren’s hands, placed just so. Forming a symbol that was nothing like reality. But one she knew, without ever having seen one in truth.
A heart.
The skeleton looked at Erin. He held up the heart and faced her. He touched his chest, his skull, his burning gaze. And he pointed at her. The heart rose again.
It broke into two pieces.
Now, she understood him. Toren spoke, without words. Hoping she could hear the rest.
I’m so tired, Mother. If not even you love me, if there is no place for me in this strange, painful place, then why was I created at all?
