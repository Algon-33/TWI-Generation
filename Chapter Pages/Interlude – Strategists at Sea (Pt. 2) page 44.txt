Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)
Page 44
He spoke to the half-Blowfish [Venom Archer]. She looked at Therrium’s face. Silently, she spat the deadly venom onto one arrow. She sighted. The Passing Shadow pursued for a second longer.
A bowstring twanged. Therrium turned the ship. It sank under the waves.
A single arrow flew, curving through the air.

“We did it. What do we do?”
“Go to Feshi’s clan? Deliver the swords? We have to get to Chandrar! We promised Fetohep, didn’t we? Dead gods! Another sea adventure? Can we hire a Courier to deliver the swords?”
“Let’s just get to harbor. We’ll sort the rest out later. I hope House Kallinad can pay Lasc for his ship!”
The students were celebrating. Merrik kept slapping Wil—and since he was short, some of the slaps were more on the lower back and buttocks. But everyone was laughing. Venaz was nodding.
“This—I have to repay you, Wil. The swords are bound to us.”
He gestured to the greatsword. Feshi stared at hers. Peki eyed it.
“Can I fight the undead?”
“I don’t know. I mean—yes, Peki. But I don’t know. The undead? My people hate the undead. Ever since the Necromancer slew the Great Chieftain, Kerash…it may be trouble, no?”
“We’ll deal with it, Feshi. Maybe Fetohep will allow us to trade blades? Let’s just—”
The arrow fell. Curving with the power of a Skill, towards Wil’s back. Yerranola laughed.
“I just wish I’d picked up the blade. I just never thought—”
She looked up. Saw the flicker in the sky. Without a word, Yerranola shoved Wil.
He hit the deck hard. He saw her shielding him, arms outstretched.
“What? Yerra, why did—?”
Venaz blinked. He saw Yerranola stumble. A black arrow shaft was sticking out of her chest.
“Yerranola!”
Merrik shouted. Peki’s head whipped around.
“Arrows! Take cover!”
The others looked around. But The Passing Shadow was gone. Yerranola lay on the deck. Wil scrambled to his feet. He ran to Yerranola.
“Yerra? Speak to me! Are you alright?”
This couldn’t be happening. Not now. Not after so much. Not after their adventure had—he saw the Selphid raising her head. Grinning, weakly.
“I’m okay. I just got scratched! Dead body, remember? I’m alright. I just—”
She was smiling. Laughing. Her expression froze. Her head fell back. Wil reached for her.
“Yerranola?”
The Selphid was silent. Wil shook her.
He waited. But the dead face didn’t move.
“…Yerra?”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Notes: This was an interlude. An adventure. With ups and downs. Miracles and tragedy.
It had a lot of words. I worked hard on it; it is a different, more contained story. And it is not over.
But for now, we’ll return to other chapters. We’ll find out what happens next—later. Hope you enjoyed; I will try to write less next chapter. But you know me and promises.
For art this time, we have LeChatDemon’s art of a mechanized…Niers Astoragon and Gazi. And a picture of Treants by Mg! I hope you enjoy! It’s amazing art. Thanks for reading.
