Erin Solstice killed someone else. She could not—would not stay in hiding while she asked them to die. Nor would they die so easily.
The [Assassins] charged, enchanted blades cutting the air. They shot spells, [Fireballs], acid orbs of their own, [Lightning Bolts] at the Antinium who had no counter to—
The spells vanished. Exploded on shimmering air. The [Assassins] in the melee smacked into something.
“Forwards. Advance without fear. We will protect each other.”
A Worker with a staff and censer walked forwards. The [Assassins] launched a second barrage and their weapons failed to reach their targets. The [Priest] held his staff high, praying with two of his hands as he walked.
[Holy Barrier]. Their weapons hung in the air and then dropped. The air pressed them back, a physical barrier of light. But it did not touch the Antinium who marched under its aegis. They loosed arrows through the glowing light, felling [Assassin] and [Thug] alike.
“What kind of barrier spell is that?”
One of the [Assassins] pointed at the moving barrier. He snapped at the ranks.
“Break it! Dispel it!”
“It’s not magic! It’s not—”
“[Valmira’s Comets].”
Six glowing meteors blew their fortifications apart. Xrn was humming as she turned. She saw more [Assassins] coming.
“Ah. You are strong. Well then—”
Four Faces emerged from the ranks. They stepped over corpses; it was pointless to throw the Ranks at this enemy. So—here was a second foe on the level of Saliss of Lights. They were still the Guild of Assassins.
Xrn beamed. Time to reduce the war strength of humanity. She raised her staff.
“[Magical Field: The Somber World of Blue].”
A radius of…blue…engulfed a thousand feet around her. The [Assassins] dodged back. They looked at each other, tested the barrier. They couldn’t tell—
[Shadowstep]. [Hundredfold Stab]. [Antimagic Blade].
The first [Assassin] was a mage-killer. He appeared on Xrn’s back and his blade struck her. A hundred damn times.
She actually turned and knocked a few thrusts away. She was fast! But the blade got her! It sank into her chitin. She made a sound—
“[Blue Lightning].”
The Face exploded as the bolts of lightning struck him. Xrn righted herself and floated a bit lower. The other three Faces stared.
“He got her…”
Another drew an arrow, loosed it. Xrn didn’t even try to dodge. The arrow shot towards her—bounced off her chest.
That same arrow could kill an armored [Knight] in low-grade magical armor in a single shot. The [Thaumaturge] shook her head.
“Wrong color. [Blue Ray of Lesser Disintegration].”
Blue? Bl—one of the [Assassins] clutched at his leg, vaporized up to the knee and screamed.
“That’s not magic. That’s not fair.”
“Yes. So you [Mages] like to say before you die.”
Xrn pointed her staff.

The Free Queen watched another [Assassin] vanish. She rubbed her palps together. It was silly to delight in it. But see how her Painted Antinium were doing? See—the fruits of her labor?
“More food, Garry.”
The Hives were in uproar. Wistram was in uproar. They were panicking. The Grand Queen’s voice snapped to the Free Queen.
“Xrn has declared war. This—is this so, Free Queen? Is there reason to go to war? Now?”
The Free Queen’s head rotated. She looked at the other Queens. And after a moment—she nodded. She chose each word with exacting care.
“Yes. As I chose my name—Bessachidia—I swear to you, Grand Queen. It is war. 109% war. Completely, without equivocation, war.”
The other Queens stirred. The Flying Queen’s mandibles opened. Oh.
“Ah. I see. Then we must march the Hives north. Prepare the armies. We will invade north Izril at once.”
