Her voice didn’t echo. And it was distinct, snappish, familiar in every syllable. But it was far away. Not distant in volume, but in…Wiskeria closed her eyes as tears sprang to them. Califor’s figure bent, her fingers reaching for her daughter.
“My daughter. You have lost your craft. You have lost your way. And you have lost me. I would give any of these back to you. But I am dead.”
“Come back! Please! I’ll be good! I’ll do anything!”
Nanette begged the ghost. She reached out and Eloise snatched her hand back. Slowly, regretfully, Califor stood.
“No. I cannot. You must be a [Witch], Nanette. That is my last lesson to you. In the end, we all must walk alone.”
“No! I want to go with you!”
Nanette struggled, screaming. This time Hedag helped hold her back. Wiskeria’s heart was breaking. Nanette should not have been here. But Mavika was speaking. She held up a pure crystal jar, beautifully carved. And the [Witch]’s eyes flashed.
“Come, Califor. Become your daughter’s strength. Return to the world of the living for a day. A year. Return and be bound.”
Wiskeria held her breath. Not for years had a spirit been summoned. Let alone—she looked at Nanette. But this was wrong. Wiskeria wanted to protest. Not like this. But Califor was shaking her head.
“No. Not for my daughter. I cannot.”
“Why? You hold the world with your grudge! Why do you not wish to return? What do you see, Califor? For centuries, [Witches] have lost what lies beyond! What has gone wrong?”
Mavika beseeched Califor. And the ghost’s voice was quiet.
“What do I see? Nothing. It is empty. Terribly empty. There is nothing here. They are all gone. I will not stay either. I will not be eaten.”
“Eaten?”
Wiskeria heard the faint voice come from Alevica. The Witch Runner was shivering. And Alevica felt it too. Something was leaking from the other side. A cold. A feeling that pulled at Wiskeria. She wanted to walk forwards. And it terrified her.
Califor turned. She stared past Nanette.
“Something walks this ground, sisters. Something older than us all. Something hungers. And it has devoured the land of death. It comes for you, the living. And it is strongest here. On these lands. Something—I know it. We all do. But it is nameless. It must be so. He must never return. I have seen the past in him. And yet I fear the future.”
She turned. Mavika was speechless. The crow [Witch] backed up as Califor stepped past her. The dead [Witch]’s eyes moved past her. Searching. And they found Wiskeria. Califor reached out, to the limits of the circle. Entreating.
“Wiskeria, daughter of Belavierr, who was my death. I crave a boon.”
“Don’t go, Wis. Don’t go. Remember the rules.”
Alevica’s teeth chattered. The ghost paused. And she became more firm. Realer. Her voice closer.
“I call you by your debt. Wiskeria. Come.”
“The ritual has gone on too long. We have made her an offer. Return her! Mavika!”
Eloise snapped. Mavika nodded. But then her head snapped up. Wiskeria was moving.
“Witch Wiskeria! Do not—”
“I have to.”
Wiskeria stared at Califor. The [Witch] was dead. Because of her. Alevica grabbed for her.
“No! Wiskeria, it’s a trick—”
But it was too late. Califor was realer by the second. The lines in her face, her eyes—the other side called to Wiskeria. She stepped forwards, dreamlike, as Califor beckoned to her.
Her foot went through the circle. Mavika hissed, but it was too late. Califor smiled. And then she reached out and seized Wiskeria. And suddenly, her form changed to fire.
