Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)

Venaz had to be contrary. But the sails rose and The Emerald Signet shot forwards. The wind was at their backs. Wil was staring as, in the distance, he saw land. And a tall—city. It was curved around the mouth of the harbor, the walls massive.
“A Walled City. Zeres, the City of Waves. And from there—my clan. Izril.”
Feshi murmured. Wil nodded. He had only been to First Landing. Izril. He inhaled, breathing in the salt air. Nearly done. The adventure was nearly—
The Passing Shadow surfaced behind The Emerald Signet. Every head turned. Merrik groaned.
“It’s him.”
Captain Therrium stood at the prow. His face was thunderous. He pointed as his ship gave one final chase.
“Drop everything. Drop the anchors. Drop the food! All we have to do is reach the harbor!”
Captain Lasc roared. His ship sped ahead. But it was battered. And the Drowned Ship was—keeping pace. It was throwing spells as the two ships raced towards Zeres. Wil stood at the prow, looking back.
In the distance, the Walled City was waiting. Wil saw a distant fleet of ships moving in and out of the harbor. He looked backwards. Therrium was pacing up and down the deck. His ship was beginning to gain.
“What if Peki throws an artificial Wil at Therrium? We can waste them. No offense, Wil.”
“None taken.”
Peki tried. But even the fake Wils were heavy and a hail of attacks came up from the enemy ship and nearly blasted her out of the sky. Therrium pointed at Wil.
“My swords.”
Wil looked back. His friends lined up near the railing.
“Time for one final clash. Wish I had one of those swords. But my hammer will do good enough. Let’s show this Drowned Man what the Titan’s students can do!”
Merrik roared. Peki landed next to him. Venaz drew his blade and his eyes gleamed.
“We won our treasure. And I have a debt to pay.”
“None of you die now!”
Yerranola warned the others. Feshi sighed as she summoned more of Khelt’s warriors. The two ships began to close. And Wil saw a flash in the distance.
Zeres’ towers lit up. And the Walled City shot something into the distance. Captain Therrium looked up with the others. He ran for the helm.
A ball of magic hit the water next to his ship. It exploded like Lasc’s [Depth Explosion] but twice as big. The Drowned Ship rocked. Wil saw a bolt of lightning arc through the sky and hit the sea.
“Zeres is attacking! Look! The navy’s coming! They know it’s us!”
Delivan was dancing and shouting; Drake ships were storming out of the bay. Wil saw distant crews of Drakes rowing against the wind. Magnificent Drake warships as their Walled City launched more spells.
“Damn you landfolk! Damn your Drakes! Damn your Walled Cities!”
Captain Therrium was shaking with rage. He saw the Drake armada coming at him.
“Captain. We can’t fight that.”
His [First Mate] was regrowing her lost limbs. The [Depth Captain] stared in despair at the distant ship. His was still pursuing. But—
It was over. Wil and the others were laughing. Cheering the Drakes. Yerra was yanking at them.
“Come on! Get below! Let’s get down before that Therrium launches a spell at our rears! It’d be like him!”
The [Depth Captain] was fuming. He saw Wil laughing, Merrik hugging Peki, and Feshi—Venaz raising his greatsword over his head. He bowed his own head.
“We’ve lost the treasure. All of it.”
His crew looked at him. The Depth Captain turned. He’d never hear the end of it. But—he had one last thing. No victory.
Just vengeance.
“Glisal. Aim for that [Lord]. Kill him.”
