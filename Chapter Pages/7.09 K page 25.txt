“Look at me. Wait. It is not alive, Trey. It is dead. Look at me.”
Trey kept his eyes on the Quarass. Slowly, ever so slowly, she let go. He realized her fingers had dug into his skin. His throat—Trey began to cough. How long had he been staring?
“You did well. Sometimes those who gaze on A’ctelios Salash and understand its nature are lost for far longer. Look. Follow my finger, but slowly.”
The Quarass pointed. Trey followed her finger. He flinched—
And saw the Carven City for what it was. A monstrous, no, eldritch head stared at him. Just the top of it. And five eyes stared outwards. Five eyes. And Trey realized they were hollow.
“The light. The light. They’re inside it! How can anyone—”
He moaned. The Quarass blocked his gaze for one moment.
“Focus on that eye. There. You can see them in it. Do not behold it as a whole. It is dead, Trey. They have hollowed it.”
“What is it?”
Gazi rose, slightly. Her hand clutched the hilt of her claymore, but her voice was very calm. Too calm.
“The Carven City. A’ctelios trusted they had killed worse than Dragons, is that not the legend, Quarass?”
“Yes. This is what they slew. And they live in it to this day. Behold, Trey. Look into the eye.”
Trey saw. The line of the thing’s…eye twisted and curved, like a magical sigil gone wrong. The Quarass stopped him again, made him look for the single hole in the center. The iris.
It was open. Light shone from within, the only light on the shrouded body. It was a portal. All five eyes had been hollowed.
“Why? But why?”
Who would do such a thing? Trey shuddered. He wanted to be sick, or faint. The Quarass spoke levelly, but even she did not stare long at A’ctelios Salash.
“In an age before the Dragons ruled, something came from beyond the edge of the world. It must have destroyed nations. But here it fell. And A’ctelios Salash was the nation that sprang from its corpse. Even when Dragons ruled, they did not take this place. And the people of A’ctelios first sheltered in its eyes. Then, over millennia, dug deeper.”
“They live there?”
“Oh yes. The children live in there. They seldom leave. It still feeds them. Still rots to this day, if decay touches it at all. The eyes are filled with structure; they dig deeper.”
Trey shuddered. The Quarass slowly moved the carpet forwards. Trey reached out.
“I can’t go inside!”
“You must. It is not as bad inside, Trey Atwood.”
“No, I can’t. That thing—it’s from my world! I know what it is! It’s not a normal monster. It’s—”
Both Gazi and the Quarass looked at Trey. The Quarass listened. She shook her head.
“It is not that, Trey. Just a thing from the world’s end. The people of Drath hunt them. I have seen others. This one was simply the largest.”
“It’s not dead.”
Trey spoke with utter conviction. The Quarass shook her head.
“It’s brain is hollow, Trey. I have lived countless lifetimes and visited A’ctelios Salash countless thousands of instances. Each time it is deeper. They hollowed the eyes first, then the head. Now they dig lower. It is dead; nothing lives. It is true the flesh does not rot, but then—neither does Dragonflesh. It is made of magic and time and it is disturbing. But you will be safe with me.”
The carpet flew onwards. Trey shuddered and averted his gaze as they flew towards the central eye.
“What kind of people live in there?”
“The kind you expect.”
Gazi’s voice was low. Trey looked at her.
“Did his M—did Flos see this?”
“He conquered Chandrar. Of course he did. I have walked A’ctelios once before, Trey Atwood. It is terrible, but few realize what it is as you did. And it is a place to trade. With…limitations.”
