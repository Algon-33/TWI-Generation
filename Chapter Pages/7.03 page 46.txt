Noass screamed. He and Sir Relz fought their way forwards. Confusion. World leaders watched as the two Drakes moved forwards. They could hear Erin, arguing with General Duln, Chaldion, and Grimalkin.
“It’s just Bird! He doesn’t know!”
“An Antinium in Pallass? Kill it! Grand Strategist Chaldion, we might be compromised. We have to evacuate the Assembly.”
“No!”
“Hello. I am Bird.”
Even a genius wouldn’t be able to make sense of it all. But there she was. They had seen her before, perhaps. But her face appeared in the scrying mirror. As clear as day.

Flos Reimarch stopped. He frowned at the screen and turned to Gazi.
“That young woman? That’s the girl who poked out your eye?”
“No way.”
Trey breathed. He stared at Gazi, incredulous. So did Teres. Gazi smiled. Her eyes, all of them, never left Erin’s face.
“Yes, your Majesty. And she comes from another world. Her name is—”

“Erin Solstice.”
Niers uttered the name slowly. Trying to figure out…everything from it. He looked at the young woman. And his stomach twisted.
“It’s her. How does she know—? Foliana, look!”
He pointed at Erin. The Squirrel Beastkin nodded.
“She knows the ant-thing. How?”
“I don’t—”
Niers sat back. Suddenly, he had a thousand questions. Terrible suppositions. Questions. He stared, unable to look away.

“The…chess player?”
Az’kerash blinked. His black eyes and white pupils locked on Erin. Venitra gasped.
“I know her, master.”
“I’m aware. But this—”

“Did you hear? She said ‘oh my god’!”
Aaron Vanwell grabbed Beatrice’s shoulder. The [Mages] of Wistram were murmuring.
“And she’s in contact with the Antinium. One’s in Pallass. This is a disaster! I thought Montressa said—where are those Ullsinoi idiots?”
Archmage Nailihuaile was uncharacteristically upset. She stared at the image.
“How did they do it? The magic door? Is it—what is it?”

“It looks like a variant of the Worker class spotted during the Antinium Wars. Not one of the ones native to Rhir’s Hives. We haven’t seen Antinium since their exodus, however, your Majesty. Your Majesty?”
Nereshal spoke slowly. The Blighted King didn’t answer. Othius the Fourth looked up. His voice trembled slightly.
“A common Worker?”
“Clearly not, Your Majesty. I simply meant in form—this one wields a bow. It may be—”
The [Chronomancer] paused. He looked at Erin Solstice. And his face drained of more color. He met his [King]’s eyes.
“Your Majesty. That young woman. That word she used…perhaps the summoning spell…”
He said no more.

“A Human?”
The Grand Queen stared. In every Hive, the queens gazed at the Human. How she protected Bird. The Armored Queen, the Twisted Queen, the Silent Queen, the Flying Queen—
The Free Queen nearly fell over in her Hive. Garry dropped his platter of food as he stared at the image in the mirror.
“Bird?”

“Erin Solstice?”
Magnolia Reinhart sprayed tea across Ressa and the magical mirror. She coughed.
“What is going on?”
 
—-
 
“Who is that?”
Many had no idea who she was. Tyrion Veltras, [Kings], monarchs—but they all saw her face. And in Manus’ war room, Dragonspeaker Luciva repeated the question.
“Who is that? Why is there a Human speaking to an Antinium?”
She turned her head slowly. The Gnoll [Strategist] answered in a weak voice.
“She must be from Liscor. We know the Hive there is—”
“It has a name. Did it call itself Bird?”
Dead silence. Even Rafaema was staring, wide-eyed. Dragonspeaker Luciva turned her head.
“I want to know who that Human is now. Now!”
