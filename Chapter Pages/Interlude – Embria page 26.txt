Interlude – Embria
Page 26
Embria whirled on him. Relc’s shrugged. It was pained, contemptuous, and tired all at once.
“I didn’t say that. But tell me. How many more should I have killed? How long should I have stuck around to kill them? One killed her. And it could have been, Humans, Gnolls, Drakes, a damn Corusdeer—”
“They killed your parents. You told me.”
“I did. And they did. I never said I was okay with it. But Antinium got my buddies. Klb is my buddy. Let’s just say it’s like that.”
It was too much like what Yvlon had said. Embria turned her back.
“You don’t have to follow me about. We had our half a day. That’s better than normal.”
Relc sighed loudly.
“Why is it always like this? I thought you liked the pet store. And the pizza. Maybe even the puzzles.”
“I did. But that’s your life, father. Not mine.”
Relc paused.
“Yeah. So maybe I should visit where you work. What’s stopping you from saying where we’ll go one time?”
“If you went back to the barracks, half of my command would be lining up to have a ‘friendly’ sparring match with you. The other half would spit in your face.”
“Sounds about right. So it’s my crummy life, huh?”
“It wouldn’t bother me if you did anything useful with your time. But what am I supposed to do? Just watch you go about your business? Can’t you—do something I’d do?”
There was a pause. And then a sigh. Embria listened to it as she stared at Yvlon and Ksmvr, who were studiously ignoring them. Well, Yvlon was.
“I tried. But I guess my life just isn’t that interesting. Puzzles. Dogs. Blue fruit juice. I’m sorry. What would you like me to do? Go for a drink? Watch a performance or something?”
“I don’t know. No.”
“Then I’m out of ideas. What do we have in common?”
Embria spun. She walked over to Relc and poked at his chest.
“You’re my father. I’m your daughter. Isn’t that enough?”
He looked down at her sadly.
“I guess not, kid. Or I guess we’re too alike. Only, we’re on the wrong side of things. You’re in the army. I’m not. How do we deal with that?”
And she had no answer. If she had, she wouldn’t be here. They wouldn’t do this. And she wouldn’t have been a Wing Commander while he stayed in Liscor. And both of them knew it. So Embria turned around. She grabbed her spear and ran through one of her exercises. The spear cut the air. Embria did a basic spear dance, alone in her world. Waiting for him to leave.
He didn’t leave, though. Whenever she turned her head, there he was. And that was different too. She’d expected him to stalk off in a huff or just sneak away. Run away. But this time he stayed. He was watching her. Watching the arcs her spear traced in the air. Embria turned her head and kept practicing. And after three more forms, she heard his voice.
“You do that pretty well. I have a similar warm-up, you know.”
“Uh huh.”
She concentrated on her footwork. It was familiar. Comforting. But she was aware of his presence. It was aggravating and familiar. And…Embria tried to shut out the rest with the purity of her art. She transitioned. From basic thrusts and steps to advanced moves. Sweeping cuts, sudden feints and reverse-strikes. The sounds in the practice courts slowly died down as Embria cut and stepped, faster and faster, each strike striving for precision, the height of martial prowess that Skills alone could not achieve.
And then she turned—and he was gone. Gone from the place he’d been standing. Just like that. It hit Embria in the gut and she staggered for a second. But what had she expected? For him to wait forever. Angrily, Embria turned. She raised her spear to slash—
