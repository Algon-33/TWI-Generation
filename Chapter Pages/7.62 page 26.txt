The panting City Runner pointed at the half-Giant. Olesm cursed. He’d chased Moore and the other forces rather than let them fight alone. Damn them! Well then—he looked around.
“It’s a fight then! We’ll have to envelop them—tell Moore to hold his ground. Can he at least follow orders? We need to set up defensive lines! Recover! Break out stamina potions!”
“Who has them?”
Captain Vell looked blankly at him. Olesm felt the burning fury in his chest abate slightly.
“The—doesn’t Jeiss have the bags of holding?”
“He ran out ages ago. We’re down to just healing potions.”
“How many? Who else has bags of holding? Potions?”
“The soldiers are carrying some. But—”
Olesm looked around. He scowled as he saw Moore, barely held back from charging.
“Keldrass’ force is ready. Where’s Umbral’s command? Wait, there it is. Why is it not formed up?”
The soldiers were just milling about. Standing, sitting. Ready for battle but nothing resembling a line. Olesm looked for Umbral, the appointed head of the military from Esthelm. Vell shook her head.
“No clue. Strategist—what’s our plan of attack?”
“You’ll reinforce this group, Captain Vell. I want your squad to hit targets—each group will advance and flank. Keldrass on the left—Menolit on the right. Bevussa and the cavalry will hit the [Mages].”
“That’s all?”
“We don’t have any [Commanders] besides Embria! She’s got the vanguard.”
“Yes sir. Only—”
“Umbral! Where’s Umbral!”
Olesm bellowed. There was no chain of command here. Heads turned. He heard the shout repeated, and then die. Frustrated, Olesm turned.
“And where are those prisoners? What happened to them?”
“They fell behind. Strategist—”
Olesm felt something draining out of him. His anger. He felt…tired. Uneasy. Very uneasy. Hectval’s army was coming their way. He looked around. Trying to conjure the fury of only a day and a half ago.
Erin was dead. Rage! Rage until Hectval was…
The fury was still there. It had never left Moore, the others. But something was hitting him. His conscience. Command.
This was a mistake. Menolit was glancing at Olesm from his spot. The [Strategist] knew it. But he’d failed to turn the army. He wasn’t a [General].
And they weren’t listening to their [Strategist]. At least, not Moore and nearly half the army.
He…
Ancestors. What was he doing? Olesm’s vision cleared for a minute. Why were they fighting uphill? On Hectval’s territory? Where were the prisoners?
“Vell—take your squad and find out what happened to the prisoner train. Now. All forces! Fall back to that position! There!”
Olesm pointed to a more defensible spot, where a natural ridgeline would give them cover on one side. The army heard him shouting. His group and two more began to move.
Moore refused to budge. So did the angriest group, which had fought forwards. Olesm bellowed at them, digging his heels into the horse’s side.
“Moore! Fall back! We’ll fight them there! There! Get moving or you’ll be out there alone!”
The Drake’s furious scream was his breaking patience. It had already been broken, but this was desperation.
The half-Giant’s inarticulate roar was his only answer. Olesm stared as the rest of the army fell back and Moore’s group began to trickle backwards. Slowly, reluctantly.
And then? Someone ran up to him, panting. Olesm saw a big man with a beard, holding a sword and wearing ill-fitting chainmail.
“Who’re you?”
“I’m—I’m from Umbral’s group. I’m in charge. You wanted me?”
“I wanted Umbral. Who in the name of Rhir’s hells are you?”
“Timbor. Timbor Parithad.”
Olesm stared. The…[Innkeeper] from Celum? He felt something lurch in his stomach.
