The Titan of Baleros flew through the night sky, bleeding. Lost. The traitor plotted in the center of the Great Company, bereft of him.
So time ran on. Curling into the future, uncertain now, where it had been so clear a moment ago.
The Meeting of Tribes.
The Summer Solstice.
The Titan’s grand arrival.
The fate of Izril.
The burgeoning link between cities, the fate of Vampires, the little white Gnoll, the schemes of Wistram, the worlds of friends.
And so much more.
The Wandering Inn itself, standing silent. An icy bier of frost, an altar upon which a young woman lay, on a hilltop filled with statues above a garden where the flowers bloomed eternally.
All of it waited. But someone was missing.
Lost.
Ryoka Griffin lay dreaming.
Erin Solstice was dead.
Can you feel it? It was all…
 
 
 
 
…Falling apart.
