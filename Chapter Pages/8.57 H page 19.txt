Merr raised her brows, interested.
“Really? Like what?”
Pisces stared at a wall, trying to remember the stories.
“Surviving a famine, for one. Or a terrible winter; people would find villages of [Peasants] who had taken fewer deaths compared to more prosperous ones that had frozen to death. The [Peasants] stretched their firewood and food supplies with Skills.”
Merr whistled.
“Something for everyone, eh? That’s what I always heard. There’s no class in this world that doesn’t offer you something. Except the Blood Classes and Skills, though.”
Pisces shivered. He knew what that meant. He had one himself.
“[Slave]. You know about more classes and Skills than I. I considered I possessed a broad spectrum of knowledge…”
Merr shrugged.
“[Bandit Lady]. We trade information, and so, yeah, ‘course I learned up on stuff like that. Most people don’t even know Blood Classes exist. Tradeoffs. You pay something. You get something.”
“Yellat Skills. Blood Classes. Are there any others? I may know of one myself. Royal Skills are known to be…unique.”
Merr raised her brows.
“I wouldn’t know, but I’ve heard they get nice things, yeah. Let me see. You know you can get Skills by training hard?”
Pisces nodded.
“Rarely.”
“Yep. I once tried to learn [Scythe Cut]. Spent four months training…never got it. I think you need a good teacher or there’s something else—there’s folks you can pay to tutor you, but I never bothered.”
“Really?”
The Stitch-Woman removed her left breast to examine it. Pisces stared as she sewed it back on. She grinned wider, then turned.
“Want to give scrubbing my back a try?”
“I…”
“I’m just kidding. We have brushes. I wouldn’t trust you to scrub a camel’s ass. Heh. Yep, they’re out there. Expensive—I could raid for a month and barely have enough saved to pay them. But apparently they do good work. You get a Skill they teach you or your money back. [Tutors]. [Weapon Masters]. And so on.”
It was a fascinating conversation. Before he knew it, Pisces had really stopped being uncomfortable. He had never talked with Merr—not privately. And this was as private as you got.
“Any more Skills?”
“Hmm…Royal, Blood, Yellat…”
“That cannot be the true appellation, surely.”
Merr stopped brushing at her back and turned her head. She looked at him over her shoulder, genuinely irritated.
“Are you doing that on purpose?”
“What?”
“Trying to make me feel stupid?”
Pisces opened his mouth.
“No I—it’s a habit. I tend to…”
He stopped. It was a habit that he liked to throw in words that made people stop. He hesitated.
“I’m sorry.”
Merr relaxed slightly.
“…Eh. It’s fine. As long as you’re not laughing at me, I won’t kick you through the tent. I hate that the most.”
“I would not do that. Ever.”
Her back was turned, but he heard a smile in her chuckle. After a while, she went on.
“I guess you’d call them Fame classes. Fame, Royalty, Blood. Oh. And I’ve only heard of this, but there’s also…Original stuff.”
Pisces sat up.
“Original?”
“Yep. And you’d call that green.”
“Green.”
Merr raised one hand.
“Don’t look at me. But you’ve felt the Blood Classes. You get it, right?”
Pisces did. His lips moved. A green…wait a second.
“Original. By original, you mean new. As in—”
“Someone gets it for the first time, yeah. A new Skill.”
Pisces stared past Merr. His lips moved.
“…I think I know at least one person with that kind of class or Skills.”
“Really. Well, I don’t think it’s special beyond being, uh, new. But I could be wrong. Ah—Inheritance Skills. You know those. Not just the ones you get passed down, either. Skills that last. Places. Legacy Skills.”
