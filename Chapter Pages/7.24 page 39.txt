“The [Witch] offered me a way to see her. And I want to. I have to. She was—my first real friend. She still is. I don’t have a purpose in the north beyond being…nice Ryoka. I left a child behind. Mrsha. I left a friend behind. Because I’m afraid of killing them. But I could bring one of them back.”
She looked up.
“But I’m afraid of the consequences. What will happen this time? How badly will I…hurt everyone?”
The young woman looked at the old farmer. Lost. And he had no answer. The fates of corn wasn’t like the lives yanked around by cruel destiny. The [Farmer] weighed his words carefully. Without much knowledge. But he spoke honestly, with all the clarity he could. Which is all you could do.
“I’m not an adventurer, Miss Ryoka. Or a [Mage]. But it seems to me you’re as miserable as that [Farmer] I knew. You speak of this like you have a choice…seems to me the only choice is when you go.”
Ryoka Griffin looked up. Lupp filled his glass with water.
“Or do you think you won’t ever go chasing your friend and trying to free her from the curse?”
The question struck Ryoka. And like that—it was like turning a key in her head. She bowed her head, feeling the world spinning.
“No. That’s absolutely right. I just fear what will happen. If it just happened to me, it would be alright.”
Lupp got up, taking their plates.
“True enough. That’s the blessing in being alone. But between you and me, Miss Ryoka? I was close to a darker day when you met me than any before. Some nights swallow you. You’ve been a comfort to this old man, at least.”
He looked back and saw her smile. Slowly, Ryoka Griffin stretched. She looked at Lupp, thoughtfully.
She was old. Old—at least in some senses. Twenty one years old. Closer to twenty-two, now. But in some ways, Ryoka wasn’t an adult yet. Not like Lupp was.
It was all relative. Children loved Ryoka. She was good at handling them, even if she didn’t like it.
It was a funny thing. Tears were difficult for Tyrion Veltras. He didn’t know how to be gentle.
Erin Solstice was a different problem. She was just no mother, could be thoughtless.
And Ryoka? She just hated seeing kids cry. She worried.
Perhaps all three missed the obvious. Which was that it was okay if children cried. Everyone needed to cry. To be uncertain. When did you stop parenting? And how did you do it well? Ryoka Griffin knew a lot of bad parenting techniques.
Slowly, Farmer Lupp cleaned a glass with some fresh water from a bucket. And he saw the young woman brushing at her eyes. Then she looked up.
Ryoka Griffin exhaled. And she felt better. She stretched lightly, resolved.
“Thanks, Lupp. I guess that clears it up. Just—can I ask one thing?”
“Of course.”
“What happened to the [Farmer] you knew? The miserable one? What did he do?”
The old man turned. He smiled.
“Why—he became an adventurer, of course. A famous one. He fought in the Second Antinium Wars against the Goblins. Ended up as part of a Named-Rank team.”
Ryoka blinked at him. The [Farmer] looked back.
“You’re joking. Where’s the ending? Is he dead?”
“Nope. Name’s Eldert. Think he changed it to something fancier, though. I haven’t seen him since. But that was him. Used to grow beets.”
The City Runner looked Lupp’s face up and down. Searching for any hint he was actually pulling her leg. Then she sat back and laughed. Just laughed.
She didn’t know what exactly was funny about it. Lupp smiled. Then, Ryoka stood.
“I’ve got to go, Lupp. Fierre’s going to be pissed. But I’ve got to go. Again. I hope I’ll see you again.”
“So you’re going.”
It wasn’t a question. Ryoka smiled.
