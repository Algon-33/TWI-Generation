“Got hit too hard? We’re all prisoners, or did you forget even that?”
Half a dozen others grinned; they all wore the same kind of ragged, full-body clothes, meant to cover themselves completely. The [Thief] looked more like a city-woman, for all she was a Stitchperson too. She spat.
“Damn you [Storm Bandits]. Nerrhavia was fine until you came along. The Watch was nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you, I could have stolen that horse and been halfway to Savere by now. ”
She glanced at Yvlon.
“You and me, we shouldn’t be here. It’s the [Storm Bandits] that they w—”
Someone kicked her with both legs, swinging their chained manacles up.
“Shut up, you fool. We’re all criminals here. You’re in the company of Merr’s Stormbandits, so I’d watch your tongue, [Thief]. We remember faces. You had better hope we don’t get put in the same cell.”
All of the [Bandits] grinned nastily and the [Thief] gulped. She fell silent as an angry voice called back.
“By Nerrhavia’s sands, shut up back there!”
Yvlon shook her head. She still felt disoriented. She glanced at a gagged prisoner sitting at the back.
“And who’s that?”
This time the first [Storm Bandit] smiled mirthlessly.
“Watch your tongue, Human or whoever you are. That’s our glorious leader, Merr the Storm. [Bandit Lady] and the reason an entire army was lying in wait for us.”
Yvlon saw an older woman glance at her; she was gagged and bound almost as extensively as the Gold-rank adventurer. She supposed that meant something. A [Bandit Lady]? Izril didn’t usually have enough [Bandits] for a [Bandit Raid Leader]…
“So who are you, then? That poor idiot must be the other Human over there.”
The [Bandit] eyed Yvlon; there were six wagons all rolling down a long trade road, occasionally passing by other vehicles. The landscape was dusty. Flat. Yet the dust coming off the dried road and carried up into the hot air almost looked like snow…
Yvlon blinked and cursed. Nope. The wind began to pick up and someone called out in a grieved voice.
“Wind’s picking up! Lower your heads!”
The [Guards] and prisoners both ducked low. Yvlon realized the bags had been for their protection as the wind blew a sandstorm over the road. Everyone’s head was ducked and sand whipped exposed skin until they were clear. One of the [Guards] turned and glowered, a hand on a long, curved sword that looked familiar to Yvlon. Not Izrilian. It looked like…Zenol’s sword…
Ah, yes. Chandrar.
“Six sandstorms so far. If this is her doing, we’ll cut off her head instead of carting her all the way, understand?”
The [Bandits] glowered sullenly back. Yvlon eyed Merr again, as the talkative [Storm Bandit] spat. The [Guard] faced forwards, making a noise of disgust.
Another wagon drew level, passing them, perhaps as the driver decided to get away from the probable cause of the frequent sandstorms. Yvlon saw an all-male group of prisoners. One jerked awake and a [Storm Bandit] grinned at the only other Human.
“Hey, you. You’re finally awake…”
They passed by. Yvlon frowned as she coughed out more sand. She looked at the [Storm Bandits], most of whom looked too tired to bother to talk.
“I’m not a criminal.”
“Well then, you’re unlucky.”
The [Bandit] grinned at her. Yvlon grunted, frowning as she tried to exert some strength. But her arm wasn’t obeying her requests to shift, and the triple-magic vice was far too tough to break.
Something was…wrong. She tried to use a Skill, like [Berserker’s Rage], but nothing happened. The amused [Bandit] laughed.
