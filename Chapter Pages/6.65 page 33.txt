“We’re not going to make it!”
Alais gasped. She was falling behind with the slower adventurers. Walt’s eyes were wide.
“We can’t fight that many! We’re outnumbered hundreds to one!”
“Hold them back! Spells!”
Kam galloped back. She loosed an arrow into the sea of Crelers. Ceria didn’t even see them land. But the adventurers turned. Ceria pointed her wand.
“[Ice Spike]! [Ice Wall]!”
The spells hit the first wave of Crelers, but the ones that were caught up were overwhelmed. A large Creler smashed the wall apart. Ceria saw the adult moving faster than the others. Isceil cursed. He turned back.
“[Mages]! Link! Montressa, give me power! I’ll blow them apart!”
The Wistram [Mages] halted. Isceil grabbed Montressa’s hand. She stared at him and Stan screamed!
“No! Keep running!”
But Palt and Ulinde had galloped over. Beza’s one good hand found Isceil’s shoulder. He closed his eyes. Ceria saw the magic flash around him, gathering.
“Buy them time! Everyone, turn and fire!”
She whirled, stopping. Pisces whirled and pointed.
“[Deathbolt].”
The leading Creler collapsed silently. But it was one. The adventurers turned. The ones with arrows and spells launched everything at the first wave, holding it back a second. Isceil was mumbling.
“Three elements. Hit the Crelers. Hit that thing—”
“Isceil! Do it!”
Palt bellowed at the Drake. The [Oldblood Magus]’s head snapped up. He inhaled and from his lips shot lightning and fire and air. A tempest shot forwards, a flaming whirlwind of lightning.
For a moment it tore the first wave of Crelers apart. The smaller ones just vanished as the searing fire and electricity hit them. But the adult was Isceil’s target. The Wistram [Mages] pointed.
“[Valmira’s Comets]!”
A hail of glowing comets followed the firestorm. Ceria saw the barrage hit the Creler as the lighting and fire engulfed it. She heard a scream. Saw the massive shape falter.
Even the Crelers slowed. The adventurers cheered. Ceria looked back. Let it be dead or hurt! She saw a shape move, cutting through the flames. And then the monstrosity emerged.
Unscathed. Isceil stared. The giant Creler bore no marks from either the comets or his attack.
“How?”
“They resist magic! Adult Crelers have spell resistance!”
Walt screamed at the adventurers. He was running. The Crelers were advancing again. Montressa stared.
“But that’s not fair. That’s—”
“Come on!”
Palt yanked her off her feet. He galloped forwards. The adventurers ran. The spells had lost them ground. The Crelers were advancing. And now they were angry. The adult was surging forwards. It opened its maw and spat something. Ceria saw a flicker. A projecti—
Isceil spun slightly, around in a perfect circle. He registered the impact with the others only after it had come. He looked down. And Ceria saw nothing.
His right arm was gone. The Drake looked around.
“Huh? My wand—”
Beza slowed, staring back at Isceil. Bemused, the Drake looked around.
“It got me? But I didn’t even see—”
Another flicker. Captain Kam dove and her horse’s head vanished. She hit the ground. The adventurers screamed.
“The door!”
“It’s not open! I sent a [Message], but it’s not open!”
Ulinde screamed at Palt. Someone bounded past her. Ksmvr twisted in midair, loosing another arrow. He landed next to Ceria.
“Captain, we will not arrive in time. The Crelers are too fast. There are too many.”
“Ceria.”
Pisces was panting. He appeared at her side. The half-Elf’s breath was caught in her chest. She inhaled. And for a long moment, like one of Erin’s [Immortal Moments], she felt time slow.
