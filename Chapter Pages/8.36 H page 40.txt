The shouting match had lasted over forty minutes. Two arrows stood out in the gates; Ceria had tossed more spells out at the [Bandits]. Both sides were getting…frustrated.
“It’s thirty gold! You can pay it! I know Gold-ranks are loaded! Don’t be an idiot!”
“You try earning thirty gold! Go to Rhir and eat maggots!”
It was a ridiculous argument. By now, all of Nerhs was for paying the bribe, extortion, robbery, or what have you. But their protector, the Gold-rank adventurer, was shouting at the [Bandits] and escalating the situation.
On the [Bandit]’s side, it was about the same energy. The regulars did not want to tangle with a Gold-rank, even a [Cryomancer] in the desert. One of them nudged the furious [Enforcement Raider].
“Boss. She’s in the area.”
“What?”
The [Enforcement Raider] was dragged out of the shouting match. She paled a bit. The [Bandit] read the words apprehensively.
“She says she’ll swing by and take care of the Gold-rank if you don’t handle it. And whatever’s in the north. But you get to say hi to Roshal’s slave markets.”
The bandit group went silent. That was not an idle threat. Nor was it a fair one; their leader had been doing a good job! But it was clearly not being appreciated by…her.
“That ain’t fair. What’s got her ticked?”
One of the others muttered, but lowered their voice and looked south warily. The lone [Mage] of their group snorted uneasily.
“Don’t you know? She hates [Cryomancers].”
“Oh. Shit.”

Ceria was getting cramped from crouching and her voice hurt from shouting for so long. More than that? Her head hurt. The sunstroke must have been getting back to her. It felt a bit squashed, as if someone were leaning on her brain.
She knew she should take the deal and just leave it be, but she was mad. [Bandits] were still [Bandits], even ones who were ‘reasonable’. She heard the woman shout.
“Listen, you Gold-rank idiot! Just pay up and we’ll be done! Twenty gold! Fourteen! Don’t make this harder, you murderer!”
Ceria poked her head out of cover and shouted back.
“Don’t call me a murderer! I haven’t murdered anyone! Yet! You’re the ones storming around here stealing from innocent people!”
Novethur blinked. The [Villagers] around the gates looked at Ceria.
The [Enforcement Raider], a hundred feet distant, hesitated.
“I didn’t call you a murderer! I said, you murderer, I’m murderer, murderer!”
Ceria Springwalker hesitated. Wait a second. That didn’t sound like a grammatical sentence, even for a [Bandit]. She rubbed at her pointed ears.
“Wait. Did you just say ‘murderer’ twice?”
The [Bandits] exchanged looks. Was the half-Elf cracking up on them? But then…someone in their group muttered.
“Wait a second. I hear it too.”
The standoff suddenly became silent. For everyone but Ceria. She looked up, and it became clear that the [Enforcement Raider] was not speaking to her. She heard the voice. Not in words. In her…head.
“Murderer. MURDERER. MURDERER.”
The same words. Growing louder. Much…much louder than the faint voice she had heard at first. There was no thinking she’d imagined it. Ceria’s stomach clenched. A bell began to sound in her mind.
“Oh no.”
In the bandits’ ranks, the same premonition triggered.
“Boss. My [Dangersense] just went off.”
“Mine too.”
The [Enforcement Raider] swung around. She looked at the village gates apprehensively, but the half-Elf had suddenly gotten to her feet. She wasn’t attacking. She was looking…north. Around. Back into the village.
Was it him? The half-Elf monster? Was it the circlet? Ceria turned, wide-eyed to Novethur, who was hearing it too.
“What is—Ceria, what is that?”
