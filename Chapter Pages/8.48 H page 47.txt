The [Wild General] crouched beside Ksmvr. The Antinium shook his head slightly.
“Tricks are too slow. He dodged dirt.”
“Vasraf, we need Ksmvr’s sword. Could he lend it to me? I would fight the Oisk Stingers.”
“Could you defeat Hscel, Your Majesty? If he goes after you, with that blade?”
Nsiia hesitated.
“—I don’t know. I don’t think he will find me easy prey.”
“And I will not risk it. He may well assail this camp if you take the blade and leave Ksmvr defenseless. Ksmvr, if you cannot win, stand back. We will take Scaied’s army without your sword.”
“Vasraf, we have one hour at most.”
The [Wild General] nodded. He stood and strode back to the front. Ksmvr was panting.
“I—do not think victory is impossible. He is fast. He is fast. But he is not a master. He has weak spots. I am just substandard.”
“Don’t say that.”
Nsiia gripped his arm. Ksmvr looked at her.
“I know I am. If I was better, I would be a [Hero]. I am not. I have a plan. I need gear. Wands.”
He was stumbling to his feet. Nsiia saw a [Mage] rush forwards. Hscel Scarless waited. Ksmvr got up.
“You don’t need to be a [Hero]. I will fight with you, Ksmvr. But not being one—remember what I said.”
Ksmvr turned blankly to Nsiia. He half-shook his head.
“You do not understand, Empress Nsiia. I was almost…no. Maybe not. But it was not a Skill. What kind of class was it?”
He ran without another word. Nsiia’s brow furrowed. What did…that mean?

Hscel and Ksmvr met a second time. The Gold-rank adventurer seemed surprised Ksmvr had returned.
“You know I’m faster. You’re worse than I am, relic or not.”
Ksmvr lifted a wand. Hscel twisted left.
“I can defeat you.”
He knew he could. Hscel was quick, but that was all he was. He was almost like Halrac. He had weaknesses. Ksmvr thought Jelaqua could beat him.
He never got close. He refused to, because if he did he was at risk, like the one time Ksmvr had detonated the Tripvine bag. No armor.
Captain Ceria could beat him. Freeze him. He would not be able to bypass her [Ice Walls] so easily.
But could he sweep her head from her shoulders before she cast a spell? Ksmvr bled. He slashed. The hand was gone before he could strike it.
Comrade Pisces could lock him down with undead. With magic and his rapier.
Yet—would Pisces also step into the whirl of blades and take a poisoned wound? Yvlon? Her arms—
He was so fast. All or nothing. Each one of Ksmvr’s teammates—
Another sting. Ksmvr let Hscel drive the blade deep. He leapt into the kris dagger, biting, slashing with all three limbs. He just needed one wound. The man jerked—he was not perfect.
But the mistake never came. He dodged back, letting go of the blade’s hilt. Ksmvr staggered as Hscel drew a spare.
“Brave.”
Ksmvr thought he heard it again. He was bleeding badly. Stumbling. He drew Hscel in. One more time. One more time. He thought he heard himself levelling, despite the sword. Because he was outmatched.
 
[H—]
[Her—]
 
Substandard. A blade swept in across his neck and opened it. Ksmvr bit and slashed without looking. A cry. Ksmvr clutched at his throat. Blood in his airway. Hscel stared at his cut arm.
“I shall remember this scar.”
That was all he said. Ksmvr said nothing. He was gurgling, reaching for a potion. Hscel Scarless leapt at him, blades closing towards Ksmvr’s neck. His eyes locked on the Antinium, staggering, the glowing sword wavering. Ksmvr tried to move it but it was so…
Heavy. Heavy? Something…
