Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 1)

“If I could go back. I could kill Skinner myself. With traps. With Skills. You can never go back. I should have been there. Six crossbow bolts. I could have taken one.”
Something was calling to him. A warm fire. A quiet inn. A smiling [Innkeeper]…but if he slept, he would never see it.
Perhaps in heaven?
“I do not believe in Pawn’s Heaven. I cannot see it. I want it. But I was there. We are all Knight.”
They were like him, in the end. They panicked, and they couldn’t think together, in that rare, wonderful moment. They had lived under the sky and ate good food and took it for granted, and they did not like him, but that was what he saw.
Squads of Antinium. Standing and dying together.
“Yes. Do that.”
“Do what? Sir? Sir…?”
“Stand. All you can do is…”
Belgrade tried to move. He could not, so he spoke. Below him, each squad, fighting—his voice could not pull them past their foes. But perhaps…
Stand. Back-to-back, in a ring. Around an inn. They didn’t have the number for grand strategy. They were not pieces on a chessboard, even if they named themselves after the game.
Stand, until the last one fell. A little chess club, fighting for each other. They did not have to be there. But they had to. And each one fought so the other wouldn’t fall. For one more second.
A hundred little chess clubs appeared in Belgrade’s vision. He smiled.
Yes. Someday they would kill Skinner. Then…then came Goblins. The [Innkeeper]. Join together. Reform the [Archers]. Send a light upwards.
We are here. Until Klbkch came from the Hive.
“We’re doing it. Sir? Sir…!”
Belgrade murmured.
“Hm? I’m awake. I’m awake. I’m…”
His voice trailed off. His side truly hurt, but it was a receding ache. Belgrade clung to something. As if he had eyes weary to close. He wanted to drift off, but not yet.
“One after the other. But not yet. We will be with you until the end. Which is now.”
His waving antennae slowly stopped moving. Then…Belgrade sighed.
“Yes. Bird was right.”
 
 
 
 
Kerone, [Squad Leader]
 
Delirious. The Antinium was delirious. He was alternating between strategy, telling them where an attack was coming. Promote the pawn. Bishop coming.
The inn. He kept talking about the inn. Below him, the squads had adopted a strange formation. The Hectval soldiers fighting with them saw them forming rings, slowly trying to link up with each other.
Squad fighting. Slowly drawing together. It was working.
But the [Strategist] was fading away. The officers were kneeling, listening. Almost…hypnotized by the story. They would get up and go, but the [Soldiers] healing, resting—heard the Antinium murmuring that oldest tale.
“It is such a strange thing, fear. I was afraid. She was afraid. But there are things worse than dying. Skinner was scary. When I woke up and everyone was gone but Pawn, Garry, Anand, and Bird…worse.”
This was Belgrade? The [Strategist] didn’t see the [Soldiers] listening. Nor…he was feverish. He spat out the water they gave him. He trailed off.
“One after the other. But not yet. We will be with you until the end. Which is now.”
“Not now. Stay with us. Belgrade? Strategist?”
He heard nothing. The Antinium looked around, and the sodden arrow in his side leaked more blood despite the claws, hands, and paws on it.
“Yes. Bird was right.”
He went still. For one second, his antennae dropped. Then Belgrade stood. He pushed himself up and stood.
Swaying, bleeding, heedless of everything else. The Antinium hunched with the effort. But he moved his feet, angled his body…how? Where?
“I was right here. I was always here.”
