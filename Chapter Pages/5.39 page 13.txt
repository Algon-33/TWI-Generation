She walked on, making a beeline for the Goblins. Wall Lord Ilvriss stared at Erin’s back and frowned. He tapped a claw on the table and looked around.
“Keep an eye on her. Don’t let her leave the inn.”

Selys jumped. She hadn’t realized that Wall Lord Ilvriss had noticed her there. She stammered and nodded.
“I’ll—I’ll try.”
Ilvriss studied Selys and nodded curtly.
“I must communicate with the Walled Cities. Until later, Miss Shivertail.”
He strode from the inn. Selys watched him go and looked around. The gathering was breaking up fast. All the adventurers were headed for the doors. All save for the Halfseekers, the Silver Swords who were going to stay the night until they could make sure that Yvlon didn’t run into the dungeon, and Halrac of Griffon Hunt. He’d gone for the doors, but Bird had stopped him.
“Mister Halrac. Everyone is very upset.”
The Antinium looked subdued as he clutched his bow worriedly. Halrac looked like the last thing he wanted to do was talk, but he let Revi and Typhenous go before him. He spoke in a voice roughened from shouting.
“Everyone is upset.”
“Oh. Is it a bad thing that has happened?”
The [Scout]’s eyes blazed.
“Yes.”
Bird rocked back and forth as he stood in front of Halrac. He looked uncertainly at the man.
“Is it…is it my fault?”
“No.”
The Worker brightened.
“Oh. That is good. I feel much better.”
He began to hum under his breath. Halrac stared at him.
“Do you not know what is happening?”
Bird shook his head cheerfully.
“No! I was in my room thinking about the bad thing I did. Then I heard many crashes. When I went to look, Lyonette was lying on the ground. So I looked for enemies. I shot at Raskghar. Who are bad. They are bad?”
He waited for Halrac to nod and then went on.
“I shot at them. Then Miss Erin ran up to get me. She said I had to come downstairs. So I did. Many people talked. But I do not know what they were talking about. Raskghar and a Calruz and more things about the dungeon. Revalantor Klbkch says that I do not need to worry about the dungeon so I do not.”
Halrac listened to Bird’s speech. He visibly wrestled with a reply, and then shook his head.
“I need to sleep.”
He stormed past Bird to the door. The Worker watched him go and then turned to Selys anxiously.
“Did I do another bad thing?”
Selys stared at him.
“No. Bird, right?”
He nodded.
“I am Bird. This all seems to be about the dungeon. And Raskghar. I am not worried about it, though. Revalantor Klbkch says that everything is going according to plan.”
The Drake bit her tongue to avoid screaming at Bird. She took a few deep breaths.
“You should worry, Bird. Mrsha is missing. So is Ceria. The Raskghar took them.”
“They did?”
Bird looked alarmed. Selys nodded. Had he not been listening? She thought of Bird and imagined him rocking back and forth, singing about birds. He had not. The Antinium looked visibly shaken.
“But Mrsha is a resident of the inn. And I am supposed to guard the inn. If Mrsha is gone, then I have failed. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.”
He began to rock back and forth. Selys stared at him and took a step back.
“It’s not your fault, Bird. The Raskghar attacked when no one was expecting them. Stop that. Please.”
Bird stopped. He looked around wildly.
“Miss Ceria is gone too. I have failed twice over. She is a resident of the inn. And Ksmvr is gone. I have failed thrice over.”
“No, Ksmvr is here. He’s…”
Selys turned. She searched for Ksmvr, but the Antinium was nowhere to be found. Selys frowned.
“He was here.”
Bird moaned.
