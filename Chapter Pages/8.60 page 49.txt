Belavierr: Hello. I see that you are looking for something with ethereal qualities. I have a spool of thread to sell. Are you interested?
Saliss: Who is this now? Are we [Weavers] or something? Wait…that is interesting.
Belavierr: I am a salesperson. I have many objects for sale. Alchemy related and otherwise. Hello. 
Alchemist I: Is this…a joke?
GSNF: Wait. That name.
 
Two users disconnected. Saliss left the room too. It was quick. Lightning strikes of realization.
 
Belavierr: Is someone interested in a spellbook?
RainyEarl: No. No!
Archmage V: Don’t be hasty. Spellbooks are always welcome. What kind are we referring to?
RainyEarl: No. Do not respond to this person.
Magus G: Agreed. Is this real? Grand Magus Eldavin, into this chat now.
Belavierr: I am prepared to make a deal. The means change and are unfamiliar. There are always those that want something.
Golden Gnoll: Who is this?
Wall Lord Ilvriss: I’m not sure. Everyone is leaving. Wait. Wait.
Witch A: You.
Belavierr: Me?
 
Almost as if the emptying rooms were like actual rooms, squeezing together. Until that name entered the chat.
 
Belavierr: Hello. I hope I am not interrupting anything. I followed someone here.
GSNF: This is an advisement: do not speak to this individual. Do not mention her name. Do not make any deals. It could be a hoax. If not…
Eldavin: I know that name.
Rhis: I do too…
Viscount V: Ah. I believe this is either a hoax or…the most significant event I can imagine.
Mons: Oh no. No, no, no.
Archmage V: I am hugely interested. Are you truly Belavierr? If so, I would greatly like to talk to you.
Belavierr: What do you have to offer?
Lionette: You? You?
Mri: Don’t talk to her. She’s evil.
Belavierr: Odd. What a strange thing. I know you? I do know you. I do know you. There you are.
YlawesB: What’s going on? My ink just turned red.
Mri: I’m just me. Go away, stinky. Stupid face.
RainyEarl: Stop talking to her. Grand Magus! 
Eldavin: I see it. The link isn’t breaking. It’s—
Lionette: Mri, leave, now. Krshia?
Krshia: I have her.
Eldavin: —stuck? I can’t sever the magic.
Rhis: That name.
Windy Girl: You.
Belavierr: I will find you.
Queen R: Who is this?
Ice Squirrel: I don’t know. I don’t like this. That’s not regular magic.
Alchemist I: Leave. I would advise you all to leave.
Anonymous Spellcaster A: Belavierr. You are not welcome here. I would advise you to leave, much less make threats.
Belavierr: I will hunt you down, oath or not. You are my nemesis. I will not harm you. You will wish you were harmed. I see your thread. You. You.
Hecrelunn: Who is this interloper? Why does that name sound familiar, even now? You invoke violence in the presence of Fetohep of Khelt. Begone.
GSNF: Truly, begone. This has gone from amusing to chaos to danger.
Magus G: Your presence is unwanted. By the rule of three, begone.
Belavierr: Where is she? Tell me.
Windy Girl: That is a child. I will not let you harm her. Do not make me invoke my friends. You were warned.
Fetohep: What.
Eldavin: What.
Belavierr: Her battles are not yours. Do not involve yourself.
RainyEarl: You are hunted. Someone, trace her magic. I will send it to the Hunter’s Guild of Terandria.
Belavierr: No one can follow my thread.
Hecrelunn: Begone, [Witch]. Or I will scorch your frail hat with fire. You cannot threaten Khelt. 
Eldavin: Agreed. Wistram will not suffer magical interlopers.
Rhis: Nor Ailendamus, one supposes.
Viscount V: Not children. Nor the Spider of Terandria. Begone. You are marked, Belavierr.
Belavierr: I did not come here to offend. This is a personal matter.
