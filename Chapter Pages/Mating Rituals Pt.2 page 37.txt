Mating Rituals Pt.2

Like diseases. Ryoka looked at Fierre, whom she was pretty certain had some super-magical immunodeficiency syndrome. Could you get that from…
A kiss? Fierre’s pale lips were stained with a bit of ink. It was not the sexy look the Vampire girl was going for. But…her deep red irises drew Ryoka in. As did her teeth.
“So…about the way two girls have…sex. You showed me and told me, but uh—you know, it’s hard to visualize it without seeing. Do you think you could…elaborate?”
Elaborate. Ryoka felt a tingle along her spine. She looked at Fierre. Play dumb.
“How do you mean, elaborate?”
“We-ell…it’s not much, but the room’s secure from everything. And um…some of the things sound interesting. I’m open-minded. If you wanted…”
The Vampire girl smiled at Ryoka. And Ryoka felt her mind flying off in multiple directions.
 
You don’t like girls. You’ve tried that. I mean—you don’t like them as much as—
Shut up! Look at those lips! We could go for that! We have been dying over here!

Could be STD’s—
Can you get something from a finger? What if she wears…gloves?
 
And most of all—Ryoka shivered. She liked Fierre. She thought she did. A lot. Fierre was like her. A girl with a secret. A different perspective.
Immortal. Strong enough to put Ryoka through a wall. Now, why was that alluring when Ryoka never liked tough guys? She licked her lips.
“I…could. Show you something.”
“Just one or two things. Maybe.”
Fierre slid along her desk. Her chair screeched a bit. That nearly brought Ryoka out of it as Fierre did that thing where she stood up and pulled the chair with her.
Oh no. She was not a Vampire seductress, even like her mother tried to be. But Ryoka was really…really…
They both had trousers on. You could do a lot with clothes. Ryoka stared at Fierre. It would be…and you didn’t have to be unsafe. The Vampire sat next to Ryoka after a bit of a struggle getting the chair over her desk. She leaned over.
And Ryoka felt something touch her just over the crotch of her pants. She jumped and felt goose bumps. Okay. If she hadn’t thought she was into it—
That changed her mind. Ryoka stared at Fierre. The Vampire was close, but she had no body heat.
“If you wanted to show me…”
And why not? They were so alike. Ryoka gulped hard. So alike.
So alike.
Abruptly, Ryoka pushed Fierre back and stood up. The Vampire recoiled, so quickly her movements were unnatural. She looked up at Ryoka.
“I’m sorry. I can’t. It’s not a good idea.”
Ryoka’s voice trembled. She was breathing fast. Fierre looked up at her.
“Why not?”
“It’s not you. It’s me. Wait, that’s stupid. I’m sorry. But I think…I’ve tried it before. Boys. And girls.”
Ryoka stammered, her thoughts in a whirl. She was trying to explain. Fierre was drawing back, hurt, but Ryoka had to explain. She looked at the Vampire girl.
“It’s not that I wouldn’t try it. Or that I’m not attracted to you Fierre, because I am.”
“So. What?”
Now the Vampire’s voice was cold. Definitely hurt. Ryoka pulled at her hair.
“I…I…I’ve done it before. I’ve tried to be with someone. Even though I liked them. Loved them. For a hot second. But it’s never worked. I couldn’t even have friends. Fierre, you know what I’m like.”
The Vampire hesitated. The hostility halted for a moment and she looked at Ryoka. After a second, she spoke.
“Bad days?”
“Yes.”
Ryoka closed her eyes. She put her palms over her eyes and sat down.
“I’m sorry. But I can’t. It’d just—make me—I’m not ready. I don’t want to hurt you and I can’t lose you as a friend.”
She sat there, shaking, lust faded. Ryoka muttered into the ground.
