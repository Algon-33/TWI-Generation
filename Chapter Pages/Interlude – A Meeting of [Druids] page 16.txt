Interlude – A Meeting of [Druids]
Page 16
That was because she walked about the edge of the dome, looking at the mushrooms in the loamy soil, marveling at the pond. A pair of Fortress Beavers backed up warily from her, but the Drake murmured and bowed and they soon were nuzzling her, letting her check their scarred flesh with dismay.
“You poor things! I am sorry. This is not my forte. Web-cousins did this to you? I am sorry. They can be cruel. On their behalf, I will do all I can. How many…oh. So few. But this place is surely safe. Can I do aught for you?”
The Drake bent her head. The Fortress Beavers nibbled on her staff and she gently lifted it.
“I see. But how strange. Someone has…”
Her head swung. The Drake frowned.
“Low-level. But…but I see a wild-walker’s touch. Is someone…?”
Mrsha was running over the hill, pursuing the magic ball, when she felt something. She looked around.
Are you here, friend?
Mrsha looked left, at Visma. But the Drake girl, laughing and breathless, hadn’t said that. Mrsha cocked her head. She ventured a tentative…yes?
It was a voice in her head. Mrsha felt the impression of a smile. And then, as she crested the hill, Ekirra came racing back towards her.
“Mrsha! Mrshamrshamrsha! Who is that?”
He pointed. Mrsha ran up on all fours and saw—
A Drake with light clothing and a staff of cobwebs. The Drake had been looking in their direction. Her eyes and Mrsha’s met at the same time. The Drake’s eyes widened.
You? You are a child!
Mrsha stared. The voice was in her head. The Drake’s jaw dropped.
“A wild-walker? So young? Ah—but you have no name! You—”
Mrsha backed up. She did not know this Drake. The voice in her head alarmed her. She turned. Ekirra and Visma looked at her, just curious.
“Who is that, Mrsha?”
“I don’t know. Stranger.”
Mrsha signed. Both glanced down at the Drake again. They looked at Mrsha, suddenly alarmed.
“Hello? Child? Are you she? I apologize for intruding!”
The Drake was waving up at them. Mrsha backed away from her.
She—the Drake was calling out with words and the voice in Mrsha’s head. Mrsha felt, instinctively, that she should trust this Drake. But that just made the other part of Mrsha, which was sensible and Lyonette-like, very worried.
“Let’s go to Miss Drassi.”
Ekirra tugged on Visma’s claws and Mrsha’s. The three backed up. The Drake slowly approached, lifting one hand.
“I’m sorry if I intruded. But I mean you no harm! I swear by the webs!”
Mrsha paused. The voice in her head echoed the Drake’s sentiments. And it was so sincere. It was like she had cast a [Truth Spell]. Slowly, Mrsha stopped.
“Mrsha…”
Ekirra whined. Mrsha ignored them. Slowly, she walked down the hill.
If it had been anyone else, Mrsha would have hesitated. But this certainty was like gravity itself. In her chest, Mrsha knew…
The Drake smiled. She looked down as Mrsha stared at her.
“Hello, friend.”
Mrsha waved. The Drake’s face was puzzled.
“I am Shassa Weaverweb. May I know your name, keeper of this…garden?”
She waved her staff around. Mrsha pointed at herself and looked around vaguely for her notes. The Drake was puzzled again.
“Can you not speak?”
No. Mrsha sighed. This was a common problem with strangers. She always needed someone to explain…
The Drake’s eyes widened.
“You cannot?”
Mrsha’s head jerked up. The Drake peered at her. Slowly, she touched her breast.
“I heard you nonetheless, small friend. Tell me.”
Mrsha thought her name. Tentatively. She saw Shassa’s mouth curl upwards.
“Ah, Mrsha, right?”
The Gnoll child jumped. Shassa laughed.
“I can hear you! We two are similar. You see?”
