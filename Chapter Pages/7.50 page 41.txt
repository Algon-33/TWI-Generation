Jasi was young. It spoke to her, and Numbtongue too. Noass had spent some time lambasting the death of ‘real music’ during his intermission. Numbtongue grinned.
“Makeup on the Singer looks a bit like Redfang warpaint. See? Looks good.”
He had some on his body. Jasi clapped her claws together.
“Right! That’s great! And you know what? I bet I could copy the Queen of Pop’s song!”
“Really?”
Numbtongue was astonished. Jasi smiled.
“We’re [Actors], Wesle, and I. Pralcem too—we have Skills to copy. Not as good as the real thing, but…is that your drum set?”
“Hmm. Kevin’s. We perform on stage.”
“Really?”
“Yep. You could join us.”
Numbtongue grinned. Jasi looked at him. Her mouth fell open.
“Wait. I—I just had an idea. Numbtongue. How well do you know those songs?”
“Mm. Take on Me? Boulevard of Broken Dreams? I know those two. Not the other one.”
“And—and could you play? If I—and Wesle and Pralcem—”
Jasi’s mind was spinning. She could sing, Wesle had drums—what other instruments were there? And they were…
But—then her face fell. She looked at Numbtongue. And remembered he was a Goblin. Sometimes you forgot. Not that he was green, or had crimson eyes. But what he was supposed to be.
“What?”
Numbtongue looked at Jasi. She sighed.
“It’s just—I’m sorry, but if we—”
She looked at him. Numbtongue’s hair was frazzled. Because he’d been wearing that helmet the entire time. She opened and closed her mouth.
“What?”
Jasi glanced at the magic door. She adjusted her dress—then carefully ripped a sleeve with her claws. The [Bard] raised an eyebrow.
“Is that bad?”
“We can get Eltistiman to [Repair] it if we need to. And speaking of which—Numbtongue, would you like to try something crazy? I don’t know if it’d work. But—this is Erin’s inn, right?”
He looked at her, an eyebrow raised. She told him her idea. And he started laughing. Of course he was in.

Cara was relaxing after the performance. She felt blissful. There was a whole lot of shit that was about to come her way.
Ailendamus would not like her taking a side. But they had already made her an enemy. They just didn’t remember. She hadn’t been the Queen of Pop at the time. As for the rest…
Wistram might get the Illuminati reference she’d painted them under if someone blabbed. But so what? It was done. Now, she was ready for what came next.
She’d deal with it tomorrow. Cara lay back—she hadn’t even bothered to take off her makeup and dress. She was so tired…
But she was still amped from the performance. So she turned on the scrying orb. Now this felt like home, in a sense.
“…wonderful performance. Not the Queen of Pop, but it doesn’t all need to be that, eh, Drassi? Some of us like classic music.”
“Up yours, Noass.”
Cara laughed as the two Drakes talked over the last performance. She liked Drassi. The two Drakes glared at each other.
“Now, we have a performance by the Players of Celum. A sensation that’s come to Invrisil. They’re putting on this…what are they called?”
“Plays.”
The Queen of Pop hit her head. She stared at the ceiling—she’d fallen out of her bed.
“What the fuck?”
She shot upright. Noass was asking Drassi what it was. The Drake folded her arms.
“They started in Celum! I’ve seen them. There’s some in Liscor, Invrisil—it’s great. It’s like a [Performer] except—well, more stylized. You’re going to want to watch it, folks.”
Was the attention there? Not…really. Bowsong’s performance and Cara’s own entertainment had distracted the audience. The scrying orbs were on, but no one was there, so to speak.
