“Very well. We are at your disposal, Strategist Olesm. Inform me of the situation.”
Olesm looked around at all the listening guardsmen, at Relc, Erin, and the others. He shook his head.
“Not here. Follow me.”
He pointed and took off at a run. Klbkch ran after him. Relc stared after the two, and then at Erin and the Goblins and his fellow guards. He looked at his spear, and then at the clear skies.
“Aw hell. I knew today was going to be a bad day.”

The alarm that went out from city to city was immediate. And as always, it led to a swift response. One by one, the cities began sending [Messages] to each other. The six-way chat opened as hundreds of other [Messages] were being sent and urgent clarifications and requests were coming through the harried Mage’s Guilds in every Drake city on the continent. But these had highest-priority.
 
Zeres. We’ve received the alert. Thoughts?
Oteslia. Is Liscor’s [Strategist] certain? They’ve issued a city-wide emergency. If they’re wrong…
Zeres. We agree with Liscor. The pieces fit. And we received intelligence from an unknown source claiming the same as Liscor’s [Strategist]. The Humans have trebuchets.
Oteslia. That’s an unfounded claim.
Zeres. It is, but it fits. And there is evidence.
Fissival is online. Where?
Zeres. There were reports of Humans employing siege weapons in a conflict with a Goblin war band, but the details were inconsistent and mentioned the Goblins constructing trebuchets of their own.
Fissival. Ludicrous.
Oteslia. But if the Humans did have trebuchets…
Manus joins the conference. This situation is grim. How did none of us spot this before now?
Zeres. The Humans played us like scatter-brained hatchlings. That’s all.
Oteslia. Focus. In that case, Liscor is under attack in four days. 
Manus. Assuming the water level drops as the [Strategist] indicated. How can the Humans be certain?
Zeres. They must be. There’s no point otherwise.
Salazsar is present. This is a disaster. We must warn the Humans at once! If they think they can take the city, it is war.
Oteslia. They’ll just deny the intent. And once they have Liscor…
Fissival. Politics aside, the Humans will attack Liscor. If they can manage it with the Goblins sacking the city, they will. But I would not trust Tyrion Veltras to hold back even if the Goblins were defeated. Objections?
Manus. None.
Zeres. We agree with your assessment.
Oteslia. We agree.
Salazsar. Something must be done. We must reinforce. At once!
Oteslia. How? They’re four days away. There’s only one city that can reach Liscor in time. Pallass must send all its armies north this instant! Or use that door!
Zeres. Where IS Pallass?
Fissival. We have made Pallass aware of the meeting.
Manus. Are their [Strategists] all asleep or something?
Oteslia. Hold on. Sending urgent request to Pallass to join in.
Zeres. It may be that they’re considering their options.
Salazsar. What options? Liscor must be held.
Zeres. Even with Pallass’ support, the odds of holding the city are low. 
Salazar. Not if they send their elites through that magic door.
Manus. And endure a bloodbath? Come on, this is Pallass we’re referring to. They’re next if Liscor falls. They’re considering whether to send all they have or…
Fissival. If Liscor falls, the Humans can march armies at us from countless directions unimpeded.
Manus. We know. But can it be held?
Zeres. Where is Pallass? Oteslia?
Oteslia. Waiting for a response…
Pallass responds. We are aware of the situation and analyzing the statements Liscor’s [Strategist] have made. They are not yet verifiable.
