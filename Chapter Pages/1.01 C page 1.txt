Oh. Oh.
So that’s what it feels like. It feels great. It feels aMaZIng.
I was right all along. Classes are what we make them. A [Clown] might not exist in this world, but we brought a bit of our world with us.
And [Clowns] aren’t just funny.
We’re hilarious.
Remember when I said I had depression? I lied.
 

 
And right now, the world is terribly, awfully, and horribly funny to me.
I put down the small body on the ground and stand up. The Troll stands over me, licking his lips. He laughs thickly, cruelly. That’s not a laugh. I show him what a real laugh sounds like.
“Hehe. Ohoho. Hahahaha. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.”
It hears me laughing. The Troll’s huge face wrinkles up in confusion. He doesn’t like what he hears. He doesn’t like the sound I’m making.
He swings his club. I go flying. Like a bird! I’m just a clown. I can’t dodge. Why would anyone think I could dodge?
I think my bones break as I hit the ground. But I sit up and keep laughing. Pain is just another side of pleasure, right? It’s so funny my broken ribs don’t even bother me.
The Troll stomps over towards me. He punches me as I sit up and down I go. Whee!
Haha. It hurts! It hurts and I bleed.
The Troll reaches to grab me, and then pauses as he notices the knife in his arm. It goes in and out as I stab.
“Stab. Stab. Stab. Stabbity.”
He stares at me. I giggle. Trolls bleed red! A wonderful discovery!
The Troll roars in my face. Ooh, scary. He steps back and raises his club. A bit too far!
“Aha! A weak spot!”
This time he screams as I stick the knife right into his loincloth. He throws me away and I roll around. Poor bones! Poor flesh! Where’s my healing potion?
The Troll stares at me as I lurch to my feet. He clutches at his groin and staggers away. I’m not hurting him much, but he’s too afraid. Of what? My face? The laughing? Can’t he take a joke?
I take two steps and remember. Oh right. Bones are broken! I take the potion Richard gave me. How horrible it is! What’s the point of getting hurt if you’re going to fix it so easily?
I drink the potion down completely. And then a second. It burns like fire. Healing potions aren’t meant to be consumed so much as applied. Too much, and you’ll suffer. But what’s suffering?
The Troll runs off—well, limps, really. I follow him. How am I supposed to find anyone with all this smoke? I keep tripping over dead bodies. Honestly. You’d think the villagers would clean up after themselves after they go bleeding all over the place.
That’s when I see the Demons. Eight of them, standing together. A group of archers, firing at someone in the distance. I hear a scream, and then the Troll shouts something at the archers as he runs towards them.
One turns her face, and I see a harsh, angular face, dark purple fur, and two ram’s horns. Hey, Eddy was right! They do sort of look like that.
“Wow. She is hot!”
But she had compound eyes, and some kind of chitin on her upper body that looks like armor. Mutants. Oh god.
That’s too funny. I’m fighting X-men?
“Hah!”
She looks at me. She’s probably in charge of this merry band. And oh look, they’ve got bows!
The other demons vary in appearance as well. One looks like he’s got fish scales, another one looks human except for the horn sticking out of his forehead, and another one is sliming from the arm.
