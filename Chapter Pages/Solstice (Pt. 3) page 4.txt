Solstice (Pt. 3)

An ancient, engraved horn rose. She whispered, begging it.
“No. Please. Don’t—”
The faerie warrior blew upon the horn. And the sound echoed across the entirety of this land. It was a dreadful noise. Ryoka’s ears bled. She clapped her hands to her ears.
“No!”
You are being hunted. Run.
She ran. She knew what the winter fae had called. She ran and ran, as more hunters joined the chase. Ryoka ran left. No thought for the city in the distance. Into the forest. Behind her, her pursuers began to close the distance. Slowly, but surely.

A moment had passed since Ryoka Griffin entered the world of the fae. A moment.
Four warriors had left. Three returned. It was as if they stepped out of the world—back into it in less than a heartbeat of time.
The frozen warrior was gone. Tyrion would have stopped that one. He would have stopped them all, continued the duel in earnest, to blood.
But he was frozen in place. They all were.
“Begone.”
The words hissed around the clearing. The party had ended. The festivities gone silent. Darkness ate away the entire world. The sky. The ground.
There was only the cleared area where the fae and mortals mingled. And beyond? Just beyond that point on the ground?
Four.
Four out of six. So they had said.
They stood there, like ideas as much as physical forms.
 
The glorious hunter.
The dancing man.
The aged woman.
And the leader.
 
They stood together, and behind them Tyrion saw flickers in the darkness. Shadows darker than black. Creeping towards the light, but halting, afraid. Begging. Begging—he heard it in his mind. His very soul.
“Remember us.”
So said the huntress. She reached out, a smile, for Tyrion. Looking at him and countless others in a moment. Halrac. Tyrion. Ylawes. Durene—
Remember what? The [Lord] backed away from the smile. The figures were grand and ragged at the same time. They seemed so desperate.
“Friends. Old friends. Will you not speak our names?”
The leader looked at Tyrion again. Both he and the huntress had some…some…connection with Tyrion. He looked at Bethal, Pryde, Ieka, Gralton, Laken—most of the nobility.
They were his too.
“Begone. Begone!”
The fae were chanting. One of them turned to the other and shrieked in a high whisper.
 
“What do you see, brother?”
“Nothing!”
 
He snarled the reply. The figures sighed. The words seemed to hurt them. The guests from elsewhere refused to look at the visitors.
And that was the difference. One group were guests. However much they played pranks, tricks, and had both malice and joy to them.
The others? Uninvited visitors.
“This day we hunger so. We starve for sustenance. Will you not share your fire? Your food and drink?”
The aged woman spoke to Tyrion. To Bethal. Again, to so many nobles. To Halrac, to Durene. To them all.
They were all hers. All, save perhaps the youngest children who had never known her terrible cruelty. Her ruthless kindness.
“Salva?”
Tyrion thought he saw a flicker on the aged woman’s face. For a moment she was a woman—he closed his eyes. Gripped his sword’s hilt and clenched his teeth so hard—
“Speak our names, friends. We beg your hospitality. If not yours, then the host of this great event.”
The dancing man bowed to Laken. He looked at Laken. Durene. Tyrion. All those who had ever known love and passion and—
“Mortal man. Do not allow them entry. Deny nothing! Deny it!”
Melidore had roared his fury. Now—six of the fae warriors stood in front of the rest of the fae host and the mortal guests.
