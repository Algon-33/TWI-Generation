Interlude – Embria

Relc slowly bit into the second-to-last pancake. Erin studied his expression.
“Sounds like fun.”
“Yeah. Of course. Why wouldn’t it be? Do you uh, want to come with?”
“Me? Or Klbkch?”
Relc hesitated.
“Both?”
The two looked at each other. Erin bit her lip. Klbkch was the first to respond.
“I believe that would be unwise. Your daughter has made her feelings about my presence very clear on fifteen different occasions.”
“Yeah. But she only says that. Come on, Klb, buddy. It’d be fun.”
“I believe that statement is incorrect on every level conceivable. And I do not believe Erin would have fun either. This is a prearranged time with you and your offspring, Relc.”
“Yeah. I don’t want to get in the way.”
“Right. She probably wouldn’t like that.”
Relc slumped into his seat and sighed. Erin looked from him to Klbkch. The Antinium was studying his partner. Erin coughed.
“So…I’m sure it’ll be fine. You’re her dad, right?”
“Yup.”
“Her actual dad.”
“Uh huh.”
“You’re her father and everything. You. Relc.”
“You keep saying that, Erin. Yes, she’s my kid.”
Relc looked up. Erin stared at him, unblinking, until the Drake looked down at his plate. He played with the scraps. Erin pondered Relc for a moment.
“So why are you trying to avoid her?”
The table fell silent. Relc silently ate the last of his pancake bits. He pushed back his plate and looked at the nearly empty pitcher of blue fruit juice. Erin stared at it, and then him. The Drake [Guardsman] stared ahead. Then he shrugged heavily. His huge shoulders slumped.
“There’s not much to talk about. Or rather, we talk about the same things, Erin. That’s all. It feels like a pain for her to do this every week. I don’t think she likes me that much, honestly. Can’t say I blame her.”
“Then why does she do it?”
“I don’t know. Duty? She’s big on duty. Which reminds me. I’d better not be late. Thanks for the juice.”
Relc stood up. He fished in his belt pouch and put down some coins. He pointed at the pitcher.
“Can I get a flask to go? Later? Sorry, but I should go. I’ll come back later for dinner if I’m free. Or pick it up after. Thanks for the meal, Erin. It was great.”
“Sure. Uh, good luck!”
Erin raised her voice. Relc was already heading towards the door. She stared at his back as he pulled open the magical door and vanished. Then she looked at Klbkch.
“That was weird. What’s that all about? Has he been like that every week?”
The Antinium nodded absently.
“Their ongoing arguments have featured heavily in Relc’s conversations with me. I gather that she wants him to rejoin Liscor’s army. He refuses to. Hence the quandary.”
“Oh. Do you think…”
Erin trailed off. She stared at the door through which Relc had gone. She half-rose, and then seemed to decide to sit. The table was quiet as Klbkch pushed back his empty plate. After a minute, he looked up seriously at Erin and opened his mandibles.
“After due consideration of the risks, I will have a pancake after all, Erin. What is the appropriate amount of syrup and butter?”
The young woman blinked. And then she beamed, Relc temporarily forgotten.
“Klbkch, you’re in for a treat. Drassi! Butter and syrup on the side! Pancake for Klbkch! Hey, wait. Do you know how to make pancakes?”
“The desire to create a pancake has never occurred within me in my entire life.”
“Today’s your lucky day.”
“Apparently?”

Liscor in the morning, the real morning in which most people got up, not just the eternal early-risers, was busy. The city was in the midst of late spring. Life was blooming across the continent. And excitement abounded.
