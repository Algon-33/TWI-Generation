It was then that Cirille got the communication scroll, handed to her by a [Messenger]. She opened it, read. The Drake stared at the neat writing, the little numbers, the—
She crumpled it up and tossed it in the fireplace. Merish and Ser Vorn looked up; Uxel uncoiled.
“What was that?”
“A damn message from High Command. No—Salazsar. One of the Walled Cities. Guess what? They want me back.”
Cirille shouldered her way to the bar. She slammed down her cup and money and watched the liquid refill. She drank again, sipping. The fiery liquid hurt and that was fine. It was a feeling, at least.
“They want you back? Is something wrong?”
Her friends sat with her. Cirille bowed her head.
“No. It’s…a separate offer. You get them, sometimes. Some Wall Lord of Salazsar—Ilvriss? He’s one of their most famous ones, I think. He’s offering me a job. A promotion, even. [General]. Of some private army. Good pay, no fighting in hell…probably some political maneuver. He might want me to fight against Fissival. Or the tribes.”
She lifted her glass and nearly threw it across the bar. The [Bartender] watched her and the Drake slowly lowered the glass. Her grip tightened.
“Cushy job. Will you take it?”
Uxel looked at her. Cirille laughed.
“If I got it a week ago, I’d have leapt at the offer. But today? Now? Ancestors damn it. We shouldn’t be fighting each other!”
Her raised voice and pounding fist made heads turn. Merish nodded, looking at her. Ser Vorn glanced at the fireplace.
“It wasn’t a good time, Cirille. But don’t reply today.”
“Ser Vorn—”
“Listen to me. You are distraught. So am I. Delezza was a friend.”
The [Knight] reached out. Cirille saw he had unshed tears in his eyes. Some of her fury—subsided. She hadn’t known Delezza long. She felt selfish, and sagged.
“I’m sorry. It’s just…”
The others nodded. She didn’t need to go on. Uxel spat venom into his drink, took a gulp.
“This is why I will leave. I will fight the Demons. But I cannot die here. If I thought we would end the war, I would fight until I end. But not…”
“That is why I come back. But that is why I leave. Don’t act rashly, Commander Cirille. Delezza would say—well, something hurtful. Just wait.”
Ser Vorn saw the Drake nod. Or jerk her head at least. After a while, Cirille stood up.
“I can’t…I’m going for a walk.”
She stood up. The others watched her leave. After a moment, Merish followed her.

She didn’t know what drove her there. Some instinct, perhaps. Intuition. Cirille stumbled through the corridors, the drink burning in her veins. And she found the inn.
The Gloomless Troupe was there. No one else. It wasn’t a night for comedy. But this—wasn’t comedy on the stage either.
The room was filled with laughter. The audience, smiles wide on their faces, laughed and giggled. Insanity. Cirille paused at the doorway, her scales prickling.
A [Clown] stood on stage. No—two [Clowns]. Both identical. They wore patched, blood-stained costumes. And they held huge…sticks?
“Ha! HAHAHA! That hurt!”
One Tom smacked the other on the head. The second Tom fell over, comically prat-falling. The audience howled with laughter. He got back up.
“You bastard! Take this!”
He pulled out a knife and stabbed the second Tom in the stomach. Hilarity. But the blood was real. The second Tom blinked. Then he kicked the other Tom between the legs.
“Are they real…?”
Cirille watched the slapstick routine. Only—the blood and wounds the two Toms caused were real. She saw one smash a potion bottle into the other’s face. He ground the glass shards into the second’s skin.
