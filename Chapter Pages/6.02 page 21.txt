Tears. It wasn’t something you were supposed to do in public. Maybe a few tears. But this? The Drakes could barely stand to look at her. The Gnolls were different, but no less uncomfortable for other reasons.
“Erin—”
Olesm was at a loss. He reached out, but Erin wouldn’t let him take her by the shoulder. Ilvriss strode over. He looked at Erin.
“Miss Solstice. Let me escort you back to your inn. This is clearly not the moment.”
He swirled his cloak, unfastening it and trying to shield Erin with it. This time Erin looked up.
“No.”
It came out as a sob. Ilvriss paused.
“But you’re—”
“No. No, no, no”
Erin backed away from him. She was wiping her face. Her nose was running. And she was crying. Crying harder than Zevara could ever remember weeping herself. Except in her room, quietly, as a child. It was a terrible mess.
And everyone was watching. Drakes. Guardsmen. Adults and children. It wasn’t something you’d ever forget. But Erin refused to go back to her inn. She kept crying. Because…because of something Numbtongue had said.
Why are you crying here? Why are you hiding? As if she was ashamed of her tears. As if they were only supposed to be in her inn, in a room, behind closed doors. Because Goblins didn’t understand tears. They didn’t understand embarrassment. But Erin wasn’t embarrassed. Not of feeling sad. So she kept crying. And the tears that had dried up fell once more.
“I—we should deal with the Hobgoblin.”
Zevara backed up, muttering to the others. She tried not to look at Erin. It was so difficult. None of the Drakes around her could manage it. But Erin refused to let her go.
“No! No! He didn’t do anything. Don’t hurt him.”
“He can’t be in the city. It’s a matter of safety.”
“He fought for you! He didn’t do—do—”
Erin started hiccupping. It was almost funny. In fact, Zevara did hear a few laughs from the crowd behind her. She turned and the laughter cut off.
“In regards to the Goblin—”
Ilvriss began, but he stopped at Numbtongue moved. He’d been looking around in silence, ignoring the tableau. Now he stepped forwards.
The City Watch tensed. Numbtongue looked at a dozen spears aimed at his heart. He looked past the armored City Watch, at the people of Liscor. Then he spoke. And his voice was loud in the silence.
“We fought for you.”
The citizens and [Guardspeople] shifted. Numbtongue looked at them. Gnolls and Drakes. Staring at him with fear, contempt, confusion. He shook his head. Looked around the city. Waved an arm.
“All of this. We fought for it. We came. We fought. We died. We fought for you. Why didn’t you let us in?”
A stir ran through the crowd. Numbtongue looked around.
“We came here. You killed us. Why? We did nothing wrong.”
“Goblins attacked Liscor.”
Zevara didn’t hear who said it. Numbtongue shook his head.
“But we fought for you. We did. We fought. Why did we die? For what? For this? For stones and you? For what?”
He shouted. The crowd was silent. Numbtongue looked around.
“We didn’t even know what was inside. We never saw this. We didn’t know. But we fought for you. Goblins attacked Liscor. Goblins defended it. We bled for this place. For what? What was it for?”
He had tears in his eyes. A Goblin’s tears. Zevara had no idea they could cry. Numbtongue looked around. He took a step. The spears raised and he stared at them.
“What did I do?”
He looked lost. The tips of the spears wavered. The City Watch looked back at Zevara. She bit her lip.
“Lower your weapons.”
“Zevara!”
Embria hissed at her. Ilvriss turned his head. He met Zevara’s eyes. Then he looked at Numbtongue.
