“La, la. It is a glorious today. All our friends come back from far away. Unless they are dead. But they are alive in my head. Today, our friends come back to the inn. So I will sing. Happiness is today. Tomorrow may be sad, but I do not think of tomorrow. So I am always glad.”

There was so much to say. So many reunions. And Mrsha would not let go of Ryoka. Like Erin—only, the Gnoll had more perseverance. She sat on Ryoka’s shoulders, paws tight around Ryoka’s head. Refusing to let go.
No one could blame her. And if—Lyonette notably, and Griffon Hunt were cooler to Ryoka, many were not. And there were stories to tell.
“New arms. Same Yvlon.”
The [Armsmistress] smiled as she flexed one arm. Ryoka just gaped as Yvlon dragged over a table one-handed. She looked at Ceria. The half-Elves eyes were different.
Ksmvr and Pisces were the same, at least. But so much was changed. Octavia bounced around the table.
“Ryoka, hey Ryoka! Guess what?”
“Hi, Octavia. Who is…this?”
“This is Numbtongue! He’s a part of the inn. You never met him! You missed—the Goblin Lord and…Numbtongue, this is Ryoka.”
“Hey.”
The Hobgoblin stared blankly at Ryoka. Her mouth opened and closed. She had seen Laken taking Goblin prisoners with all that entailed. And Erin had—she looked at Erin.
“Is this—uh—is—is this a Toren scenario, Erin?”
She tried to be oblique, but Erin’s face instantly fell. The others winced. Numbtongue gave Ryoka a cold look. The [Bard] thought about it, raised a finger, and walked off. He was rather pleased about that. Mrsha smacked the back of Ryoka’s head.
“No, it’s not. But you warned me about Toren. Numbtongue’s cool. I—met Toren again. Right before the inn was destroyed.”
“What?”
Ryoka sat up, alarmed. Erin tried to explain.
“Don’t worry. He’s dead. I’m almost positive—we found bone dust. And that was when the inn collapsed…oh. You didn’t know about that. But that wasn’t Toren, that was the Crelers.”
“The what?”
Ryoka half-shouted. The others smirked at her face. Then Ceria turned pale.
“Oh dead gods. You don’t know anything. You’re so behind!”
“I know that. I’m sorry—”
“She doesn’t know anything. Pisces!”
Ceria grabbed the [Necromancer]. Pisces sniffed, looking amused; he’d already caught up to what Ceria was thinking of. Ryoka blinked.
“What have I missed?”
Erin began to count on her fingers as Mrsha rested her chin on Ryoka’s head.
“Oh, the Goblin Lord’s army nearly destroying the city. The Raskghar, the dungeon always attacking us, Pawn and his Painted Antinium—there were Wyverns at Pallass, but that was this other thing…we have a door to Pallass, by the way. And Invrisil. Krshia’s a member of Liscor’s Council, and so is Lism, that jerk. Oh, Magnolia came by with this [Druid], we made chocolate—I have a magical garden—and magical fire—”
Ceria broke in, urgently.
“Calruz.”
The City Runner had been trying to ask questions. But that one word silenced her. She turned to Ceria. Erin’s eyes went round.
“Oh. Yes.”
“Calruz?”
Ryoka breathed. It couldn’t be. But—Ceria was looking at her. And she and Olesm had survived…Ryoka was suddenly on her feet.
“W-what about Calruz?”
The half-Elf [Cryomancer] took a few breaths. She looked about—Yvlon steadied her. Then she looked at Ryoka.
“He’s alive. In Liscor’s jail. He—”
Ryoka’s ears rang. She leaned on the table. Listened as Ceria told her—something. Then she looked up.
“Where is he? He’s in Liscor?”
The others looked at each other. Erin nodded.
“I see him…sometimes. Mainly to throw bread at him. I threw a bagel last time. He’s got two rats. He’s…”
“I have to see him.”
