Every [Informant] in the world was scrambling to update their notes. The Walled Cities were in shock. And in The Wandering Inn, Klbkch swore as he saw Bird in the mirror.
“That krxsching idiot—”
Mrsha heard the first Antinium swear-word in her entire life. And not even Lyonette paid attention. Prognugators Tersk and Dekass were just staring.
“An Antinium…in Pallass.”
Watch Captain Zevara’s head turned, looking at Tersk. Then Klbkch. And she remembered it. Lyonette remembered it. Mrsha and every citizen of Liscor remembered it. They were allies now. But the dream of the Antinium.
The Antinium Wars echoed. And there she was. Erin Solstice, trying to shield Bird. Grimalkin just pushed Erin out of the way. He knew Bird. But this moment was larger than he was.
“Antinium.”
Chaldion’s voice cut through the silence. Bird jerked his head around.
“Oh. Hello.”
“You are trespassing in Pallass. Move and be destroyed.”
General Duln’s voice shook with fury. Thousands of warriors were aiming every weapon at Bird. He looked around. And only now vaguely realized he might be in trouble. He looked at Erin. And he didn’t move.
Bird was literal. He took instructions and suggestion at face value. And he was gifted at carrying them out exactly as you said. That was because he was Bird. Not anyone else. Just Bird. Erin’s lovely, singing…
“Bird.”
Erin looked up at him. Bird tilted his head. He wasn’t afraid. He could see the danger, but he just looked at her.
“Are you in trouble, Miss Erin?”
Grimalkin looked at her. Chaldion looked at Erin. The world stared as Erin replied.
“No. I think—you’re in trouble.”
“Really?”
Bird looked around. He shrugged.
“I see. But if I am in trouble, that is okay. Because I know how to get out of trouble. Ksmvr taught me. He said it always works in his experience.”
“What…?”
Erin stared at Bird. Uncomprehending. And if she’d put the pieces together, she might have stopped Bird. But the Antinium Worker was a literalist. He listened. And he took things at face value.
He stood. Chaldion pointed at him.
“Antinium! Stand down!”
“I would like to go home, please and thanks.”
“You are going nowhere. You are under arrest—you’re—”
General Duln didn’t have a word for what Bird was. He just pointed, mouthing soundlessly. Bird looked at him. And then at the sea of faces. Into the scrying mirror. At Grimalkin, at Chaldion.
“I am going home. I had fun hunting all the big birds.”
“Big—birds?”
Noass choked. Bird looked at him. His voice was bright and cheerful.
“Yes. I am Bird and I hunt birds. That is my job. That was why I was created.”
He paused and muttered.
“Probably.”
Everyone was listening to him. Grimalkin spoke, overriding General Duln’s next words.
“Antinium Bird, you are under arrest for trespassing in Pallass. Move from this spot and you will be destroyed. Is this clear?”
Bird stared at Grimalkin.
“I would not like to be under arrest. I have things to do. You should not arrest me.”
He said it as if he was the one with the upper hand. Grimalkin stared at Bird. And then at Erin. Even she was speechless in this moment. He shook his head.
“Antinium, this is not an option. You are surrounded. Surrender or be destroyed.”
Bird paused. He nodded, murmuring to himself.
“And then Ksmvr said—yes.”
Bird raised his head. Pallass’ army tensed, but Bird just stood there. On the dead Wyvern’s back. He pointed at Grimalkin with one of his four arms.
“Tell me something, then. Is it war?”
His words came out of the Antinium’s mandibles. A cheerful shout. It echoed across Pallass. And Grimalkin froze. Chaldion stared up.
