“Of course. For you, Daughter. How long do you ask this of me?”
Oh. Of course. Wiskeria closed her eyes. But—could she live with that? She looked up, biting her lip.
“Two hundred years. Can you do that, Mother?”
“Of course. If you wish it, for two hundred years I will use no spell of stitching, no cloth artifacts or magic of thread and needle. Does this satisfy you?”
Belavierr said it as if it were the lightest thing in the world. And even her daughter had to stare. But then Wiskeria nodded. She even smiled.
“Yes! Yes! Of course! Thank you, Mother.”
The face didn’t change one whit. But then Belavierr bent and regarded her daughter. She paused again.
“It is what you wish, Daughter. But why do you ask it of me?”
“Because I don’t want you to take lives, like you did to Rehanna, Mother. So—you will do it? For two hundred years, you won’t steal life or trade curses? You’ll be…”
“Ah.”
And that one sound pierced Wiskeria’s heart. Belavierr straightened. And then slowly, she shook her head.
“No. I’m afraid you misunderstand me, Daughter. I will not do that. I will give up my stitch-spells and pacts of thread. But the deal I made with the woman Rehanna I will continue to make. Else I would die.”
“But—you promised!”
Wiskeria stared up at her mother, shocked. Belavierr never lied. But the Stitch Witch didn’t appear guilty.
“I promised to give up my magic. My spells and lore. For you, Daughter, I would give it away, and seal my knowledge for two hundred years. But what you ask is different. You ask that I would change my craft. The very essence of what I am.”
“Yes! Will you do it? I will never ask you for anything again, Mother! Please?”
“No.”
The word echoed. And the face that delivered it never changed. That was what was worst of Belavierr. Not her magic, or her deeds. It was the way she moved through life, uncaring. Uninterested. It hurt to argue with her. Wiskeria clenched her hands, her nails digging into her flesh.
“But that is all I want. All I want from you, Mother. I would be happy if you did this.”
“It is my craft.”
“It hurts people. You take their lives, Mother. You take their emotions. You take. And you hurt people. Sometimes you kill—because someone asks it of you.”
“Yes. Because we make a fair deal.”
“Fair? It’s not fair! What of the people who paid you to make a curse-doll? What about the people you hurt because someone pays you in years of their life?”
Belavierr didn’t even blink.
“It is fairly done between I and them. They have something I wish, and I have a service or thing they desire. That is the oldest exchange, Daughter. You know this.”
“But what about the people you hurt? If someone pays you to hurt someone else—”
“They have paid. And I act.”
“But that’s wrong. There’s no justice in what you do, Mother.”
The [Witch] blinked once.
“Of course not. It is an exchange. When one wishes, another’s wishes are destroyed. That is how all things are done, Daughter.”
She paused. Belavierr glanced up, and a slight frown crossed her features.
“We have had this conversation before.”
“Yes. We have. And I still can’t accept it, Mother.”
Wiskeria was close to tears. But she refused to cry. Belavierr would not understand. She looked up and tried one last time.
“Mother. I want you to change. I want you to stop killing because you’re asked. Stop stealing life and—and offering these deals. Stop your craft. Practice other magic. No—keep using your stitch-magic. But don’t take like you do. Can you do that? For me?”
