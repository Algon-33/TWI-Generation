“A man called Lord Acton said that nearly two hundred years ago. He said that, and that is factual. But you know what? He could be wrong. He lived in a time unlike ours. And he made those observations as a generalization. Does power always corrupt? Did it corrupt you? Zevara? Magnolia—okay, that’s debatable. Saliss?”
The [Innkeeper] thought of the naked Drake with the power to kill. She bit her lip.
“But…isn’t there something true in it?”
“There is. I believe that, Erin. But listen to this. A lot later than Lord Acton, closer to now, a man named Robert Caro said something else of our leaders. ‘Power always reveals’. I like that a lot more. We need to pursue power. Saying the right thing is meaningless in either world. Have power, and do—”
It was philosophy. Ryoka broke off.
“I wish I had the power to do more. Because I would. I don’t have time to wait until the winter. Not with all that will happen. I can’t. And none of that really matters. I just have to run, Erin. I have to run. Am I insane for feeling that way? Please—tell me. Maybe Lyonette’s right. Maybe I am…some vain, egotistical person who thinks the world revolves around me. Definitely. Probably. Maybe. Am I…wrong?”
The [Innkeeper] shook her head. Erin Solstice wasn’t one for what Ryoka had gone into. Ethics—if they were over a game of chess, maybe. But it was simpler for her. She had been ready to stop Ryoka. Now?
She looked at her friend.
“I’ve always been jealous of you.”
Ryoka blinked. She glanced at Erin. Smiled, shaking her head.
“That’s my line. But I never expected you to say that about me.”
Erin was caught off-guard.
“What, me? Why?”
Ryoka eyed Erin and sighed. She didn’t see it. Ryoka pointed around the inn.
“Where could I start? You—you can do the things I talk about. You lead people. You’re not afraid to fight. You—can create miracles. Real, miracles.”
The [Innkeeper] shook her head, troubled.
“I don’t. People say they’re miracles but—they’re not.”
“I know that. I know how much it costs. I still think you can make them.”
Ryoka leaned forwards. Erin blinked at her, uncomprehending. Ryoka went on.
“A miracle. Like stopping the Goblin Lord—or killing that thing called Skinner. A proper one. I know how much it took. Lives.”
The hill in the garden. Erin’s eyes widened.
“That’s not a miracle.”
Ryoka shrugged.
“Isn’t it? That’s what everyone wants. A miracle you don’t have to work for. But I don’t really see those. Usually—it’s someone else making it work. And that costs a lot, sometimes. You do it, though. You changed people’s minds. Stopped an army. I wished I could do that. I…wish I had your ability to make friends. Like people.”
Ryoka studied her knuckles. She touched them as Erin searched for a reply to that. Ryoka mumbled.
“Laken Godart is his name. I told you about him. And you might not like him. I—punched him and ran off the last time we met. I regret that.”
“I punch things.”
The [Innkeeper] waved her hand. Ryoka half-smiled.
“But you don’t run. You’d stay and…persuade him. I? Lyonette was right. I half-solve a problem. I rescue a Gnoll, collect some Earthers, and then I dump them in your lap. You’re the one who helped make a home for Mrsha. You turned the others into amazing people. Kevin and his bike. Joseph, playing soccer instead of drinking.”
“He still drinks. But he’s working on it.”
The two smiled for a moment. Ryoka closed her eyes.
