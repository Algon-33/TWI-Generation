He shrugged and kicked a pile of gold apart. Erin stared at the coins. Some of them were filthy, probably from sitting in the dungeon for so long. Other coins were bloodstained. Mrsha wrinkled her nose as she sniffed a goblet with a bit of blood on one side.
“And you have another bag of holding filled with this? And—”
She looked at the other two sacks. Rabbiteater nodded. He flexed his arms to show Erin how hard it had been to carry the non-magical bags.
“Heavy. Glittery stuff heavy.”
“I’d imagine so. This isn’t just gold coins like we use. Some of this—some of this is pure gold.”
Revi’s hands trembled as she picked up a coin. She scored the soft gold with a knife, peeling up a sliver of gold. She showed it to Halrac. The [Scout]’s eyes were wide as he held it up.
“Oh dead gods. Someone tell me I’m not dreaming.”
Jelaqua looked at the treasure on the floor, blinking. She looked around. The other adventurers looked too stunned for words. She stared at the jewels lying at her feet.
“This can’t be real. Pinch me, someone.”
Moore did, pinching Jelaqua’s arm. The Selphid paused.
“I didn’t feel that.”
“You’re a Selphid. Of course you didn’t.”
Seborn stepped forwards. He bent and picked up a pair of tongs, which were made of silver and ivory. He opened and closed them.
“This is a treasure haul. I’ve seen something like this only once. And that was—storms and salt. This is what the Raskghar had?”
“Of course. Of course they had it. We just didn’t notice it because we attacked their camp.”
Ceria felt lightheaded. She spoke, feeling something like mirth bubbling up inside them. She looked at the others, a crazy smile tugging at her face.
“We were so busy attacking the camp that we never thought to—and Calruz never said—”
Yvlon shook her head.
“He probably didn’t know. The Raskghar might have kept it hidden. And the Goblins…”
She glanced at the Hobs, who were scratching themselves and looking pleased at the reaction they’d elicited.
“…they don’t care about treasure.”
“We care about artifacts. Not shiny things. They’re too shiny. Too heavy. Not useful. Good for adventurer traps, maybe.”
Numbtongue corrected Yvlon. The woman nodded and then stared at the treasure. Ksmvr glanced around.
“Am I to take it that this is all treasure for us?”
“No, it’s the Goblin’s—”
Erin turned to the Redfangs. They shook their heads.
“Not for us. You take.”
Headscratcher pointed at Erin. She opened her mouth to protest. Pisces cut her off.
“It’s no good to them, Erin. But in our hands, it can be, ah, delicately spent. I think this is a gift.”
“Mhm.”
The Hobs nodded. Numbtongue pointed at the adventuring teams, who stared at him, faces all as pale as Jelaqua’s.
“For fighting in the dungeon. For killing Raskghar. You did it. We don’t need it. So it’s yours. You have it. An adventurer’s treasure.”
The other three teams looked at Numbtongue, shocked. Typhenous was bending down, touching the treasure. He looked up. Revi had a circlet in her hands.
“For us? Just for us? You’re serious?”
Numbtongue nodded. Jelaqua shook her head.
“We should share it. This is—we should tell the others.”
The others looked at her. Yvlon half-nodded. Pisces frowned. No one else nodded. Revi looked at Jelaqua.
“I have an alternative idea: no. This is ours. There’s no way I’ll split this. Can I change your mind?”
The Selphid hesitated. She looked back at Revi and then nodded.
“Yeah. That was a terrible idea. Thanks for talking me out of it.”
“Anytime.”
The others went back to staring at the treasure. Erin felt a bit lightheaded. She looked at the other bags.
“So that’s all the treasure?”
