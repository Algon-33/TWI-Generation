The [Supreme Marshal] roared around the panicking command. They had to regroup! Germina would pay for this. They had to…
The [Strategists] and officers not attacking the city were in a flurry, trying to shout orders at each group, address the sudden attacks. They barely noticed one of the serving girls drop her tray and reach for something.
The [Slave] ran at the [Surpreme Marshal], and he noticed the motion, twisting, fumbling for his sword—
His [Bodyguards] ran the [Slave] through. The command reeled back from the glaring eyes, the gasping lips.
“The Quarass—”
“Assassination attempt! Order every officer to watch themselves! That—that damned woman! Inform the capital the Quarass has fully sided with Reim!”
The [Supreme Marshal] staggered back, nodding at his guards who stabbed the [Slave] again. She was grinning glassily at him. The [Supreme Marshal] snarled at her, as if she had wronged him. His [Slave].
The young woman gurgled as she died. She was still…smiling.
“The Quarass can set us free. [Death Spell—”
The [Supreme Marshal] looked at her and then went pale. He leapt with a scream as his [Bodyguards] shouted and—
 
——
 
The [Soldiers] marching towards Reim were staring at the fire from the walls when they heard the explosion. They whirled, looked back in horror, and pointed.
[Firestorm]. The spell engulfed the [Supreme Marshal]’s tent, raining blue fire down around them. Nerrhavia’s forces, in disarray, stared at their burning command and saw Reim launching its counterattack.

The Quarass had sided with Reim! The little figure fighting with sword and shield, inspiring her people to greater ferocity, greater terror—
Nailihuaile was shaking with frustration. Why now? Why…
“There’s a group of [Riders] coming from the northwest, Archmage. The [Strategists] are all reporting a force of cavalry. Barely four thousand strong. Nerrhavia’s Fallen is—wavering.”
Beatrice was keeping abreast of the rest of the battle as it happened. Naili snapped at her.
“Shut up! Don’t talk to me about strategy! We’ll bombard them with spells ourselves if we have to! Where is Troy Atlas? If I need to, I’ll put a wand to Amerys’ head and threaten the King of Destruction myself!”
The Gazer was fighting Viltach and Feor. Naili slithered faster as her bodyguard of Revivalists kept pace. Troy Atlas, that Earther—
She came across two fallen young men and stopped for a second. Tov was breathing, but scorched badly—yet a potion had saved his life. Goelv?
“Dead?”
One of the [Mages] bent down. It was Beatrice who asked; Naili didn’t even care, but she slowed to let them check. How had they gotten free?
“Alive. Barely.”
The Gazer’s eyes were all moving around randomly, rather than rolled up. Disconcerting. Eerie, even to someone who had met Gazers. He was definitely unconscious, but…
“Help! Help!”
A young voice screamed through the hallway. Naili snapped her staff—the Serkonian Lance—up but relaxed as she saw who it was.
A terrified [Lady] ran towards them, screaming.
“He’s killing them! He’s killing them all!”
“Emirea?”
One of the Revivalists turned, and the others stopped as the [Lady] threw herself towards them. Her dress was torn, and someone had blackened one of her eyes.
“What happened? How did they get free?”
Emirea was sobbing.
“Calac—he’s killing them! He has a Naq-Alrama dagger, and he’s—help! Help, please!”
Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she was shaking uncontrollably. Naili cursed.
“That [Bandit Lady] or whoever…keep clear of him. With me.”
“What about—Emirea, let go, let go, please.”
