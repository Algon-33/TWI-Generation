The team whirled. Two of them cast spells—Niers plugged his ears as the explosions echoed. He felt the impacts—but then spoke again.
“You really think you can kill me? I’m the Titan of Baleros.”
“Where is he?”
“I don’t know! I don’t know!”
They stared in the wrong direction entirely. Speaking stone. Niers smirked. He’d tossed one and was bouncing his voice. Intimidation tactics.
“Let’s call it a draw. You all get lost and I won’t put a hundred thousand gold bounty on all your heads. I know who betrayed me. I know who to go after. And I don’t feel like wasting a ten thousand gold bolt on each of you.”
“Boss—I think—”
One of the adventurer’s nerves was already breaking. Niers saw the Gold-rank Captain’s head swivel around.
“No. No, shut up. We’re dead if he gets away. He’s bluffing.”
Damn. He had better nerves than the rest. Niers felt in his pouch. He’d have to set a trap. They were moving towards the speaking stone. He began dropping miniature charges. Here, here—blow off a leg and hopefully take—
“Wait a second. I have an idea. Stop! [Detect Magic].”
Niers’ skin prickled again. Oh no. Not—
The [Mage] whirled. Niers raised his crossbow.
“He’s right th—”
The bolt exploded on the magical barrier. The [Mage] went flying. Niers began to shout. Skills! He had so few Skills that worked without a group! Damn it! He shouldn’t have bluffed. He should have run. Idiot. Overconfident—used to everyone running from him. Used to having an army.
“…that spark of youth…When did we lose that? Have we lost that? Because if we have—it’s time to retire.”
A [Warrior] charged at him with a roar.
“You little bastard! You—”
No time. Niers kicked his boots against the ground.
“Hop!”
He shot upwards as the Boots of the Grasshopper flicked him into the air. The [Warrior] recoiled as his [Braveheart’s Charge] sent him forwards. He tried to swat at the foot-high figure—
Niers landed on his head. He caught himself by an ear. An armored gauntlet went up to swat him—
[Potion of Haste], drunk in midair. The Fraerling disappeared. The [Warrior] screamed.
“He’s on me!”
“Hold still! Where is he? Where—”
“He’s in my armor! He’s in my—”
The armored man had been yanking at his breastplate, feeling the movements. Suddenly—he began screaming.
“Miral! Miral! What’s happening?”
The Human man fell down. He began thrashing. The others crowded around as he screamed. Then opened his mouth wide.
Wide. As if someone was forcing his jaws apart. He howled with such an animalistic sound of pain the others recoiled. Then suddenly—shuddered.
“Miral?”
Blood leaked from his mouth. The others stared at him. They’d yanked off the breastplate. And they saw—
Someone had cut into his chest, through the shoulder. Just carved into the man’s body like—like—
“Dead fucking gods.”
Then the man’s chest bulged. An enchanted sword carved out. A tiny face appeared. And a crossb—
The third adventurer’s face exploded. The last two recoiled with screams. The Fraerling fired again, cursing. He missed—the last two had shields on.
“Kill him! Kill him!”
The adventurer captain was shrieking at the [Mage]. The spells blasted into the [Warrior]’s corpse, but the Fraerling was using it as a shield.
“Monster!”
The Titan was laughing. Covered in blood, he clutched at the tonic.
“You should have run.”
He rose—and saw the adventurer [Captain] charging at him. Niers cursed. He raised his crossbow. And too late—saw the [Mage] switch tactics.
“[Lightning Bolt].”
