Queen Oiena gestured, but Ryoka stared about. Everyone was gathered around—she didn’t see Itorin–but even a lot of important people who might attend the Court of Masks, Oesca and Ivenius, both so excited they’d missed her…
What was this? Baron Regalius was leading a small procession, beaming, and there was music and everyone looked thrilled. But why though? And anyways, it was totally the wrong music for Ailendamus.
Not enough pomp. Way too fast-beat. Way too…peppy. Ryoka Griffin paused.
Way too…
Poppy.
Pop-y.
Then she heard it. A voice, singing amidst instruments that this world had never known until now. Ryoka slowly rose, and she saw it. A dancing procession, coming in. A figure on a moving platform, glittering like magic and artifice and celebrity.
She heard a voice, singing a familiar song, and the audience cheered. Ryoka Griffin’s mouth opened as the [Popstar] of Terandria, the Singer, Cara O’ Sullivan, blew a kiss and entered Ailendamus’ capital. She turned, waving, and Ryoka Griffin saw her eyes alight on the Wind Runner.

Author’s Note: That last line lacks a lot of context. Also, it’s weird that that’s a plot thread. Like—you could say that and get a lot of weird looks, but say that to a reader of The Wandering Inn and…you’ll still get weird looks.
27,000 words, roughly. I was really tired since I had 0 days off since last chapter, so I said—I said, pirateaba, go for 22,000 words.
Eh, 5k margin of error. I’ll try for shorter and more impactful next time. Or does this not have enough pact? Let me know, but we are moving! I am moving!
…I want a teleporter. Thanks for reading and see you in a bit!
