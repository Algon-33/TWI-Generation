The [Bandit Lady] followed his gaze. Towards Bearig, Rophir, Eloque, and Qshom. She clapped him on the shoulder.
“We can spare four horses. But if we go down there, Pisces, my lad—they’re nearly done.”
She pointed. The last three dozen [Slaves] were pressed against the wall. Pisces looked down at them.
“Boss, this is stupid.”
One of the [Bandits] tried to argue with them, eyes moving uncertainly from Merr to Pisces. Because she lacked context. Merr nodded simply.
“It is.”

They came down the hill without warning. [Raiders] and [Bandits], charging over the top of the hill in a second.
Roshal didn’t even see them at first. A sandstorm blew downwards, and the [Slavers] only saw that. They shouted warnings though; they sensed it—
Then they saw the first [Rider] break through the dust and grit at her back. She rode down on the unguarded lines of [Slaves], a sword held high. After her came a figure on horseback, a flaming rapier drawn. He aimed a finger and a bolt of black light went through one of the [Guards] tending to the wagons. He collapsed without a word, and the [Bandit Lady] chopped downwards.
“Charge! Wipe them out!”
The riders burst out of the sandstorm blinding their opponents. They rode down, slashing and breaking away, going for the sides, fighting, as figures on foot charged after them. There were strange creatures amid the storm. The [Guards] who turned, locking blades with people charging forwards on foot, saw glowing eyes amid the dust.
What was that? Someone was shouting.
“Merr the Storm! [Bandit] attack! Open the gates! It’s him! It’s the [Necromancer]—”
Then the voice cut off as a giant bear made of bone leapt out of the darkness, and a figure on its back brought a sword down.
A Skeleton Lord. And—the [Guards] shouted as the glowing eyes drew nearer, revealing burning flames in pale sockets of bone.
“Undead! Skeletons!”
“Keep the [Slaves] shackled! [Rally To Me]!”
The [Slave Master] with the enchanted sword whirled. The [Slavers] around him rallied, standing firm as the [Necromancer] and [Bandits] tried to break the shackles on the [Slaves]. Some tried to grab keys from dead [Guards], but the wagon bars were iron and so were the chains!
A figure burst past the fighting there and charged the main body of Roshal’s fighters. He flicked a ring, and the [Slave Master] leaned out of his saddle as a bolt of magic flashed past his head. A [Guard] saw the figure coming at him and raised his shield—so Pisces stabbed him in the guts.
Merr the Storm broke forwards. She whirled her sword overhead.
“To me! Keep moving! [Fight Like You Mean It], you half-balled idiots!”
The [Raiders] and [Bandits] screamed, surging forwards to clash with the armored [Guards]. Off-guard, they faltered—then held as the [Slave Taker] leader raised his sword.
“[Feet of Stone]. Stand or die. Roshal commands it! Now—[Advantage: The Unchained].”
Merr faltered as a spear slashed at her face. She knocked it down, but suddenly a quarter of the fighters found the [Guards] and [Slavers] fighting faster against them, stronger—the [Necromancer] cursed, raised his hands, and blasted a line of [Guards] with flames.
“Fire!”
They ran, screaming, rolling, but it didn’t ignite the Stitch-folk fully. The [Slave Master] recoiled, then pointed his sword down at Pisces.
“That is the slave worth a million gold pieces! Ten thousand to the one who brings him down!”
The [Guards] charged. Pisces backed up—then vanished with an oath. He reappeared, running one of the [Mages] through the side, and whirled.
