Earth’s reality, in the year of 2021 combined with Erin’s mortal life. Somehow…Kasigna had made these false realities, baked of bits of truth and what might have been, or might be happening. Erin shuddered as the women circled, the three-in-one. Inspecting her.
“Why is that a problem? Where is this? I’m dead. I—”
“This is my place. And I created it because I wanted to see. You were first. You should have been wondrous. That was the criteria. But your great talent was…this.”
She had a walking cane, now. The old woman hobbled, the young one walked briskly. The middle-aged woman faced Erin. She pointed and Erin’s head turned.
Her chessboard. Erin looked at it.
“What?”
“The first one was to be great and glorious. A fitting first child. Talented. Unique. So many of the children are. So many not. But you—this is your talent?”
Erin shrugged.
“Well yeah, I’m good at chess.”
The look the strange woman gave her was withering. The chess board vanished.
“What a worthless mistake that you of all others were chosen by chance.”
She vanished too. Erin felt the room vanishing.
“Hey! Hey, that’s rude! Chess is great! Come back! Where am I? What are you doing?”
A presence. Erin spun. Kasigna sat on her bed. Now, existence was a circle of about six feet. Erin’s eyes darted around. What would happen if this room vanished? This person…she made a punching fist and eyed her hand.
She didn’t want to touch Kasigna. The strange woman smiled even as her eyes pierced the [Innkeeper].
“And yet, you stand above most of the other children. You survive. And you saw the untruth of this place time and time again. How? I made it of your world. Events there. Songs. Your memory. Yet still, you break out. How?”
She pressed Erin and it was like a weight on Erin’s entire being. The [Innkeeper] struggled, but this was no aura.
Nor did she refuse to answer. It was a relief to Erin to explain. She turned and pointed.
“There. Duh.”
Kasigna frowned. The pressure abated. She craned her neck to see…
The computer. It was still showing the chess game, despite no wires existing. She frowned.
“Is this trickery? How?”
“No, it’s chess. If you made this place—you suck at chess.”
Erin informed Kasigna with a triumphant smile. The stranger just stared at her. Erin went on.
“It’s the chess program. I keep beating it and that shouldn’t be possible. Chess programs are better than any Human, y’know. Each time I start winning I get confused. Grandmasters too. And I win each game or lose. You end up in draws all the time at high levels. All I do is win and it gets old. Also, suspicious.”
“What?”
The voice of the unknown, sinister presence was unworldly and possessed three ages in one. Nevertheless, it had the miffed quality of someone who had no idea what Erin was talking about.
Erin stood there, smugly folding her arms and smiling for all of five seconds. Then her face fell.
“Wait, I just gave away the secret. Now I’m trapped forever, aren’t I? Drat.”
Kasigna stirred. She stood up without standing. One moment she was sitting, the next, standing.
There were no transitions to how she moved, Erin realized. If she was walking, she vanished and Erin saw her walking, or saw one of her ages. Now, the room vanished.
Erin stood in nothing. There was only her; nowhere to run. She could not run, or move her feet. She tried, but Kasigna was there.
“No. No more illusions, Erin Solstice. I have seen you. My curiosity assuaged. Now, it is time.”
“Time? Let me go. I—I don’t want to—”
