“Huh. Well—it shouldn’t take too long. Hedault maybe, but I doubt we can even schedule time with him today. We’ll sound it out. But on that note, Erin…I actually wanted to ask you a favor?”
Here it came. Erin visibly braced.
“Sure? For what?”
Go into the dungeon? Fight a Rock Crab barehanded? Ryoka’s favors could be anything. The City Runner took a breath.
“I…need you to take care of Mrsha instead of letting her latch onto me around dinner, okay? I mean—it might not be necessary in which case I’ll let you know. But just in case.”
Erin Solstice gave her friend a blank look.
“What, that’s all?”
“Yes. But I’m serious, Erin.”
Ryoka met her gaze, trying not to look embarrassed. Erin scratched her head.
“Sure can do. But why?”
“I…might be occupied.”
“With what?”
“Someone.”
Erin! Ryoka glared at her. But the [Innkeeper] was giving her one of the blank Erin-stares that was either genuine or completely fake.
“Who’s someone? Whoa—you mean a date? Who?”
Ryoka flushed. Erin was doing it on purpose this time. Sometimes you couldn’t tell, but this time it was obvious, no matter how good the act was and it stung.
“You know who!”
The [Innkeeper] had to think. She shook her head slowly.
“I do? No. Who?”
“Relc! Stop playing dumb, Erin. I know you don’t like—what is it?”
The aggravated Runner saw Erin’s face fall. Ryoka stopped growing angry abruptly.
“What?”
Relc. The goofy [Guard] of Liscor, and also an exceptionally dangerous guy with a spear. He had doubtless been busy with the Raskghar situation, but Ryoka was…curious if he’d stayed away because he’d heard she was back or if he was just busy. She thought—but Erin’s face had suddenly fallen and Ryoka realized something had happened since she’d been gone.
“Did…something happen to Relc?”

Relc was gone. Ryoka Griffin listened to the brief account of him—leaving due to the Golden Triangle situation and sagged.
“Oh.”
There was nothing more to say. If you weren’t there, you couldn’t complain about having missed it. Erin nodded glumly.
“Yeah. Another city. I forget which one. You were…gonna see if he was there?”
Ryoka nodded absently. Erin peered at her.
“You did like him?”
Dead gods, she could be sensitive or cripplingly insensitive at times. Ryoka rubbed at her face. Or was it just her being embarrassed to talk about normal things? She spoke, haltingly.
“He’s…a nice guy. Sort of an idiot, but that made two of us. I did like him.”
“Oh. Good. Sorry. I thought you knew. Well, I forgot.”
Ryoka nodded, then shook her head.
“It’s no big deal. It was just—I was just going to take a hike with him. I kind of offered to last time. See the Floodplains. It was just a thing. Sorry for snapping at you.”
Erin’s eyes flickered.
“Wow. So you liked him?”
The other young woman snapped at last.
“No, Erin. I barely know him! I just liked…him. He seemed like a nice, lonely guy to me. I was wondering how he was doing, that’s all.”
The [Innkeeper] looked guilty and backed down at once.
“Sorry. I just wanted to know.”
It wasn’t her fault. Ryoka felt bad about not knowing, so she was being snappy. She shook her head, mumbling an apology. But she did wonder about Erin.
Don’t you feel alone some days? But perhaps Mrsha, the inn, her friends and family were enough for Erin. Ryoka envied that, if it were true.
“Have you heard from Relc?”
Erin shook her head sadly.
“I sent him a [Message], but I never got an answer.”
“I see. I hope he’s okay.”
“Me too.”
That was all there was to say. Ryoka went to get a crepe.
