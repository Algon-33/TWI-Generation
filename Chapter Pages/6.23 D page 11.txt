“How’s thirty gold pieces for every officer you knock out sound?”
The Gnoll [Captain] grinned as a reply. Wil straightened. Negotiations were done. The [Captains] strolled past the soldiers forming up. Wil pointed.
“[Mages]! Hold those mists back. Sir Kelm, advance!”
The [Knight] raised a padded spear.
“Knights of the Autumn, with me!”
And then moved. Wil snatched his map and strode back. A group of [Mages] and officers approached him. The first thing he demanded was a table. He heard Talia mounting up behind him.
“Wil? Where do we go?”
Her voice was tentative. But it was a fair question. A group of knights in bright, burnished armor of gold, brass—the colors of summer—were lined up behind her. Wil raised his head.
Fighting. He pointed at the map.
“Move forwards. Gather at the second command spot. [Mages], you have your orders. Horse! Feshi—”
The Gnoll grinned at him. Her eyes flicked to Wil as he mounted up.
“You planned this. Am I part of the plans?”
“Only if you want to be. Can you ride?”
The Gnoll hesitated. Then she held up a hand. Wil pulled her onto the saddle. He felt her grab him as he turned to his sister.
“Talia! We’re supporting Sir Kelm! Take us down that street!”
His sister whooped as she lowered the visor on her helmet.
“Forward, Knights of Summer! Take the streets!”
She began riding forwards. Wil kicked the horse into motion. He saw Talia’s head twisting towards him and she raised her visor in alarm.
“Wil! Stay back! You’re trying to win, remember?”
“We need to push in. We’ll reform later. You need me.”
There was no time to argue. The [Knights] rode forwards, a solid body. Wil eyed the numbers. Disperse them later. For now, they were a fist. And he intended to gain as much ground as he could.
“Infantry ahead! They’re filling a street!”
A [Scout] raced back. Wil saw Humans already skirmishing with a group of Dullahans who’d blocked off a street exit ahead of him. It hadn’t even been ten minutes! The Iron Vanguard had lightning reflexes. He pointed at the group as the Knights of Summer slowed.
“Pull the soldiers back. We’re breaking through. Advance at a trot!”
Thunder. The Human [Soldiers] fell back. The Dullahans did not follow. They looked up and saw the riders coming at them. To their credit, the line only wavered. Then it formed into a solid formation. Braced. Wil kicked his horse.
“Canter!”
Faster now. He could see the Dullahan [Sergeant] shouting orders as the [Knights] lowered the thin lances as spears. Wil shouted.
“Stow lances! Swords!”
Hesitation. He saw the [Knights] switching weapons. Spears might kill at this charge. The Dullahans were also pikeless. But they were still braced. They thought the [Knights] wouldn’t charge for fear of their horses injuring themselves. That was their only mistake.
“Gallop!”
On they came. Feshi was howling something behind Wil. He roared as the first rank of [Knights] closed on the ranks of Dullahans.
“[Ram’s Charge]!”
The Dullahans [Sergeant] raised his hand too late, eyes widening.
“[Shieldwall—]”
The impact sent Dullahans flying. Wil saw the formation scatter like pebbles before a wave. He shouted as he saw [Knights] lashing out with swords.
“Ride on! Keep moving! Avoid trampling!”
The Humans caught their horses just in time. The wounded Dullahans pulled back as the Knights of the Summer raced past them. Wil looked around. He bellowed one word.
“[Healers]!”
They were already converging on the fight. Wil pointed, and his [Knights] rode onwards. Faster. He bared his teeth. Take as much ground as he could in the first few minutes. And then push! Push!
