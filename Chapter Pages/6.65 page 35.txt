The Hobgoblin ran through the door, sword drawn. He wasn’t paralyzed. And neither was Relc. The [Guardsman] turned and sprinted for his spear. He looked around.
“Where?”
“I don’t know. Everyone, its coming! Get up and run!”
Mrsha clutched at Lyonette. Everyone was staring. Erin was white-eyed, shouting. They had never seen her like this. Then Lyonette stood.
“Get the potions! Where’s it coming from?”
The frozen moment broke. The Players scrambled off the stage. The guests surged to their feet. Lyonette grabbed Mrsha, shouting.
“The potions!”
“No, run!”
“Where? Where is it?”
Relc sprinted to the windows. He tore the front door open, looking around wildly. Erin ran for the door.
“Erin—”
Octavia shouted, but Erin slammed the door in her face. That didn’t change her [Dangersense]. She turned the dial on the door.
“Liscor. Lyonette, go!”
“What if it’s Liscor?”
Erin hesitated. She looked around. Relc called from the door.
“It’s not outside. What the hell is it?”
“The dungeon.”
Drassi whispered. Someone cursed. Erin looked around.
“I don’t know what—”
She looked at the door. Turned the dial to the yellow stone. Erin yanked it open, saw a full street. A Drake [Guardsman] leaned forwards.
“Hey, you need a receipt.”
“Something’s coming. Something’s about to hit Liscor! Warn Venim! Sound the alarm!”
Erin shouted at the Drake. The [Guardsman] stared at her. Then he grinned, uncertainly. The people on Pallass’ street looked around.
“What?”
He stared past Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked around.
“Drassi!”
She grabbed the Drake. The [Gossip] stared at her.
“Erin, what—”
“Go! Tell Grimalkin something’s coming!”
Erin shoved her through the door. Drassi stumbled. One of the Drakes on duty cried out.
“Hey! You can’t do that! You need—”
“Something is going to attack the inn.”
Erin saw the Drakes looking about incredulously. Relc was checking out the door, but there was nothing. It was such an ordinary day. The young woman pointed.
“Something—my [Dangersense] is going off. Something is going to happen!”
“Miss, I don’t sense anything. And I have [Dangersense].”
A [Guard] protested. Erin drew breath to scream as they tried to shove Drassi back towards the door. Then a familiar Drake shoved the others aside.
Kel, the surly Drake, stared at Erin. He met her eyes.
“How bad?”
“Worse than the moths. Worse than Skinner.”
She panted. Time was too slow. A second was an hour. Kel stared at Erin. And then he nodded.
“Get Watch Captain Venim. Sound the alarm! Move!”
“Erin!”
Drassi shouted, but Erin was already fumbling the door closed. Lyonette reappeared; Mrsha was clutching her neck.
“Erin! Where is it?”
“Do we go to Liscor? Celum?”
“I don’t know! Celum! Yes! Maybe? I don’t know where it’s coming from!”
Erin was looking around, panting. Relc growled.
“Aw, nuts. What is it? Raskghar? Monsters? Those damn [Mages]?”
Mrsha sniffed the air. Erin looked towards the door. If it was the dungeon, and they went out—but if it was in Liscor?
“Erin, we’re here. What are we looking for?”
Seborn appeared at her side. Moore on his left. Erin counted. Numbtongue had his sword and guitar out. The Hobgoblin looked at her.
“Stay in the inn? Better cover.”
He gestured around. Erin wavered.
“I—I don’t know where it’s coming from—wait! Wait! Relc, Seborn, Moore, Numbtongue, everyone get ready!”
It was growing stronger. Erin saw Seborn flicker over to a window. Desperately, Erin turned the door. Maybe there was a clue? She flung it open.
Liscor, nothing. People on the streets. 
Pallass, Kel staring. 
Esthelm, empty, a man asking to come in. 
Celum, Octavia, gaping. 
The Bloodfields—
