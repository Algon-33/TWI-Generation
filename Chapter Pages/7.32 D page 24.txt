She pleaded with Erin as the [Innkeeper] scribbled down the amounts in rough letters and shoved it at Ulinde. Erin turned to her.
“Keep enough mold to grow, Octavia. This can help with the Yellow Rivers thing. We’re sending it to Baleros.”
“Baleros?”
Half the listeners exclaimed. Olesm looked sharply at Maviola, but she was taken aback as everyone else. Octavia blinked.
“How much is it going for?”
“Free. We’re sending it via Courier.”
“Erin!’
“It’s going to help with the Yellow Rivers disease, Octavia.”
The [Innkeeper] snapped. The [Alchemist] opened and closed her mouth.
“But—but—”
But the profits. She looked around. Numbtongue was there. Octavia hesitated—then deflated.
“Okay.”
Erin didn’t notice at first. Numbtongue did. He went over, poked Erin hard. She yelped.
“Numbtongue, what—”
He whispered in her ear. The [Innkeeper] turned.
“But—oh. Right. Okay—okay. Let me…”
She closed her eyes for a moment, pinched the bridge of her nose and thought. Octavia glanced up. Numbtongue nodded to her. Erin turned.
“Sorry. Listen, Octavia, this stuff is going to go for free. To a [Doctor]. She needs it. I’m sorry, but people—thousands, tens of thousands—need this stuff now.”
“That’s fine, Erin. Really.”
The [Innkeeper] shook her head.
“No, listen, Octavia. We’re sending as much as we can to Baleros so they can grow more and use the stuff. But keep…a quarter of your supply? Ulinde, write down Octavia’s name. And Stitchworks. Tell them it’s from her. And Octavia?”
She pointed at the Stitch-Girl. The [Alchemist] glanced up.
“…Put your name on every jar, Octavia. And grow lots more. People are going to want as much as they can get. When they buy it from you, make it cheap. And the [Doctor] is going to tell everyone who made it. I’ll buy your entire supply myself; don’t worry. No matter how much gold…”
“I’ll pay for it.”
A voice. Erin turned. And a [Sinew Magus] rose from the chair where he’d been prepared to take notes. Grimalkin strode forwards.
“This can cure the plague in Zeres?”
His eyes were sharp as he looked at Erin and then the mold and penicillin. Erin glanced up at Grimalkin.
“That’s right.”
“Then Pallass will pay for it. And if the Assembly won’t, I’ll cover it myself. Send the bill to me.”
Octavia felt weak-kneed. Grimalkin glanced at Erin.
“Just so long as some of it reaches Zeres, as well as Baleros.”
“The [Doctor] needs it to make it most effective. But yeah. I’ll talk to you in…thirty minutes. Octavia? You’re getting paid. Is that okay?”
“Sure. I mean…put my name on the jars?”
“In big lettering. Like a logo or something.”
Erin helpfully pointed to the glass jar. Octavia thought about that. Baleros? A cure for…she began muttering.
“Complimentary matches. Aaah! I need to grow more mold! Labels? A logo?”
She ran. Erin had penicillin. Grimalkin was asking questions, but she had to get this stuff moving. Delivery would take a longer time. She needed a Courier.

“So, I need a Courier from the nearest big port. One who can go on the oceans fast. But you need to get it there. Like—by nightfall. Any city will do; anyone with a Courier. I’ll hire them. How about it, Hawk?”
The Rabbit Beastkin looked at Erin. He looked at the table piled with Octavia-brand jars which she was hastily slapping logos on. Mrsha had come up with it. A needle and thread sticking out of a jar. Lyonette had…improved the art with [Flawless Attempt].
Teriarch was harrumphily listening as the two servants tried to placate his bad mood. Selys was trying to keep up. And Hawk?
“No, Erin. Nothing doing.”
He shook his head. Erin blinked.
