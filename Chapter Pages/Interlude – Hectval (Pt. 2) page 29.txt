Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 2)
Page 29
“Because it is a poor precedent to execute a warrior in front of their fellows. It is not uncommon; the House of Minos has known the like, but not in modern day. The offense must be grave indeed, and we pride honor above all. We know there are reckless warriors, those with poor temper. We do not kill them for that, Tersk. What serves the Antinium, or Liscor’s army, in killing this Worker?”
“It would…eliminate a threat.”
“If this Antinium was going to kill, surely it would have already.”
“It disrupts Squad 5.”
Tersk countered, but his tone was…thoughtful. Dekass looked incredulous as Calruz knelt.
“Worker. Or…Crusader 57. You have caused a disturbance. If you refrain from doing so, will you fight and obey orders?”
The thrashing Worker slowed. It looked up at Calruz, and the strange, oddly quavering voice actually calmed down. Although that was saying a half-screamed warble turned into a molten hiss of unsurpassed rage.
“I…am obeying. Even your stupid orders. I fight Hectval.”
Calruz rose. Tersk looked struck.
“I…that is not what Aberrations do. Or say.”
“What is normal?”
The Minotaur was curious, not that he would ever return to Minos. But perhaps he could report it? Tersk shrugged.
“Curse the Queen. Swear to kill everything. Rebel. ‘I will not obey.’”
Calruz’s brown eyes fixed on Tersk, and the Minotaur felt his palm grow suddenly sweaty. Did the Antinium not know how it sounded? It didn’t sound like madness. That sounded like…
“Tersk. Will you let this [Crusader] live? His squad might watch him.”
“It is a risk to them and our division. Persuade me, Calruz.”
Tersk tilted his head left and right. Calruz met his gaze.
“I cannot give you a logical argument based on your Hive’s orders or history. I can only suggest this, Tersk. It would be dishonorable to kill this Worker. That is what I believe.”
Dekass rotated from Tersk to Calruz as the Armored Prognugator went still. He drew his sword.
“Alright then. Let us kill—”
Tersk grabbed Dekass.
“I see. Then we will let Crusader 57 live.”
“Whaaaat?‘
Dekass looked as flabbergasted as any Antinium Calruz had ever seen. Yet Tersk just nodded.
“Come with me, Calruz. We will dine as I believe is customary. You must explain more.”
The Minotaur agreed. They headed towards Tersk’s tent as Squad 5 stared down at Crusader 57. The Worker watched the Prognugators go, then tried to bite Crusader 51’s hand.
“Let go of me. Idiots.”
Crusader 51 jerked back. He rose and stared after Calruz as the Worker stomped back to his zweihander and sat down. He almost hoped Crusader 57 would die to the curse next battle. An Aberration was…?
Crusader 53 just watched Calruz, one-sided like him. The [Maceman] had seen Calruz nod at him. Thoughtfully, Crusader 53 sat down and began toying with his gear.
The next time Calruz saw Squad 5, the angry Worker was still alive. Oh—and the Minotaur did a double-take when he saw Crusader 53 had glued two makeshift horns to his helmet.
Poor little warriors. Calruz tapped one of Crusader 53’s fists with his own, looking in his eyes. He missed Rhata and Haldagaz. 🐁 But he fought that these children might live. Yet he—Olesm—they could not stop Manus.
Not yet.
Calruz could endure the losses of the Antinium because he had lost his team, his comrades before. He had lost his mind and honor. Rather than stop under the weight of it all, he fought harder.
He did not know how they dealt with it. Crusader 57 was a symptom, not an aberration. Even Antinium broke. And these…these weren’t mindless Soldiers or Workers.
