Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)

Yerranola rose, Merrik and Peki by her side. Feshi reached for another arrow. And Wil saw Venaz close his eyes.
“Ah. Her wrath. Honor to you.”
He stood. Wil looked up at him. And then—he saw a shadow flash across the sky. Venaz knelt.
The [Pirate Captain] drawing alongside The Emerald Signet looked up. He saw something flying through the sky. Rotating. It fell towards him. He stared up. It looked like—but it was too large.
“Is that…an axe?”
It cut through the mast, crashed through the deck and the [Captain]. The ship buckled, and then—sank.
Captain Therrium stared at the gigantic axe buried in the ship. He stared at the sky. He reached for the helm.
The Bloodtear Pirates turned. The Minotaur warship launched another volley, but the other four ships fled. Fled, in a moment. For reinforcements, to regroup. They asked no questions.
That was an axe.

Axes, the Minotaur [Prince], a Moment’s Peace
 
“What in the name of the Grandfathers was that?”
Merrik stared at the place the ship had sunk. Wil looked at Venaz. The Minotaur replied calmly, smirking.
“That. Was an axe.”
The students looked at him. The other ships were fleeing. Wil turned to Peki.
“Peki, punch Venaz.”
The Garuda raised a fist. The Minotaur stepped back, scowling.
“It was what I meant! We’re in range of the House of Minos. Well—it must have expanded last I checked. She leveled.”
“She? Who?”
“Captain! Lord Kallinad! Minotaur warship is turning! They want to board!”
Inky called out from the crow’s nest. Venaz’s head turned. But he pointed at the place the Bloodtear Pirates’ ship had sunk.
“Her range. That axe was thrown by the King of Minotaurs herself. It was her great Skill. One of the reasons we are safe. The [Axe of Gigant]. A shipbreaking blow.”
He pointed into the distance. Wil saw the other warship drawing alongside. He looked at Venaz.
“Venaz. I’ve known [Kings]. Even the King of Destruction. We studied him. I’ve never, ever seen a Skill like that.”
“Because your [Kings] were rulers. Our King won her title by strength, Wil. Strength and honor. And her class, her first class? Was [Axe Thrower].”
The Minotaur warship was filled with Minotaurs. And like Venaz, they had knelt the direction the axe had come. Now—Wil saw Venaz pointing.
The waters were stirring. Something rose, from where the [Pirate]’s ship had sunk. An axe rose out of the waters and slowly flew back the way it had come.
It was much smaller than when it had landed. But it flashed through the air, rotating. Wil and the others stared.
“The pride of the Minotaurs. Be honored, Wil Kallinad. For you, our King threw one of her personal weapons. She does not do it often; even most [Pirates] do not know of her strength.”
Venaz beamed. Wil nodded, speechless.
“And are we…safe?”
Merrik looked up at Venaz. He nodded.
“So long as we remain here? Of course! We’ll have time to replenish our stocks. Repair the ship. And perhaps even sail with a fleet as an escort—depending on if Kallinad can pay for it. But once we reach the House of Minos’ harbors even The Iron Vanguard would fear to invade!”
He laughed, spreading his arms wide. Wil looked ahead. The other warship was moving alongside theirs. He saw the ballistae, the catapult. And—striding alongside the decks, his arms spread in welcome, a Minotaur in full armor. Venaz’s eyes widened. He turned to Wil.
“And here I thought we couldn’t get more lucky. Wil—you’ll have the honor of being escorted by a Prince of Minotaurs.”
“A Prince?”
Wil stared at the distant Minotaur. Venaz was nodding.
