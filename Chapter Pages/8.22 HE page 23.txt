Yvlon’s mind raced. Had she…? No! Even in her crazed state, she would never have done that!
It seemed the [Bandits] had heard some of what she was accused of, though. And the one lie in the system of truths also didn’t account for rumor.
“They put a murderer in the same wagon with us? We’re [Bandits]! Hey! Hey, why is this one here! What if she goes berserk and tries to kill us?”
One of the [Bandits] called to the [Guard]. The Stitch-guard glanced back and gave Yvlon an uneasy look. The Human woman blinked as the [Caravan Guard] checked their weapon.
“She’s shackled up. Shut up, I said! You [Bandits] don’t deserve any better. You’ve got your fancy [Bandit Lady]. Let them fight.”
Merr was eying Yvlon. The Human woman bared her teeth. One of the [Bandits] squeaked.
“She’s not gagged! She’s got her teeth! She could kill us all!”
What stories had spread while she was asleep? Yvlon growled, not to reassure them so much as establish the truth.
“I didn’t kill anyone. I cut them, but they were String Folk. I couldn’t have injured more than a d—two d—thr…”
She broke off. The [Bandits] looked at her and began edging so far back they were in danger of falling off the wagon.
That bastard, Ducaz, had clearly lied about something. But here was the thing: his lie happened to be grounded in an uncomfortable truth. Which was that Yvlon did recall at least three dozen [Guards] running away from her as she went on a one-armed rampage.
To be fair, they were Ducaz’ corrupt lot at first, and low-level probably. She had been wearing enchanted armor, swinging a Gold-rank’s sword and fresh off fighting top-tier undead.
Still. Not a great look. At least it meant they stopped kicking her. Yvlon glowered at Merr and the others.
“…Where am I?”
One of them opened their mouth nervously. Yvlon cut them off.
“I’m in Chandrar. Nerrhavia’s Fallen?”
They eyed her, as if not knowing that much was already making them concerned. One of them whispered to the [Thief]—
“She’s on powder. The dangerous stuff. I once knew a woman who woke up not knowing where she was, two thousand miles away after taking too much. Six months later!”
“Where. Am. I?”
One of the [Bandits] looked around, then replied hurriedly.
“Nerrhavia’s Fallen! Chandrar! On the road to one of the larger cities, Caardefelt if I’m any judge, alright? Just stay calm!”
“I am calm. When do I get to appeal my case? Who charged me?”
The [Bandits] licked their lips. They nudged each other, whispering, until the [Thief] was kicked forwards. The woman explained.
“You…were charged. And sentenced. We’re not on the way to a trial, Miss Please-Don’t-Hurt-Me. We’re already on the way to our punishment.”
Yvlon stared at them. Then, as she saw the city in the distance, in the largest nation in Chandrar, she did lose her temper. The [Bandits] drew back, shouting, as the [Guards] turned and saw the Human woman shouting obscenities at Ducaz and struggling, her arm flashing as she tried to tear free of the manacles. She fell to the wagon floor, unable to move.
“Stop! Stop, you fleshy idiot!”
One shouted, raising a club to beat her senseless. They knew of this dangerous criminal’s reputation, and were wary, but she was bound with four magical, anti-Skill enchanted bindings! There was no way—
Yvlon Byres tore the first manacle apart and the [Bandits]’ eyes bulged. The [Guards] screamed as she ripped off her bindings, shattering the magical metal and stood. Yvlon Byres rose—as Merr and the [Thief] both hopped off the wagon to land in the dust and hide. Her face was twisted with the beginnings of a furious rage—
