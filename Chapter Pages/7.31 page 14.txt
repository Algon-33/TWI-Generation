There were mundane ones. Pelt chose casually; they were all alike.
“Get it out there. In the open. Huh. That one’s got a fucking crack. Get rid of it!”
He kicked the offending anvil. There was a flurry and other hands dragged his chosen anvil out.
The crowds were still there. Pelt strode past the annoying flies—people from Liscor and Pallass. He looked around.
“Apprentice! Emessa, damn it. Get your tail out here!”
The Drake appeared and Esthelm’s people murmured. But the Antinium had rebuilt their walls and she carried a hammer. She was familiar to them because of that.
An angry [Innkeeper] was dancing about in the street. But she’d brought a Gnoll and one of Terandria’s [Princesses] to see him. Pelt recognized the hair color. Also, the way Lyonette carried herself.
He didn’t care. The Dwarf looked at Emessa.
“Set up the outdoor forge. I’m not hammering hot; steel temperature. And get me the crystal.”
Her eyes widened. The others stirred. Maviola glanced at Pelt.
“You’re going to do some hammering?”
The Dwarf didn’t reply. He glanced at Maviola, and then narrowed his eyes. Grandfathers, it was her. The same flame! You couldn’t copy that. He shuddered. Magic potions and immortals. He was just a smith. He didn’t say a word though; he had kept far greater secrets than hers faithfully.
He only knew one thing. The Dwarf saw the [Innkeeper] approach. He made no sign he saw her. She had a big enough head already.
“Say. Centaur. Palt’s the name, right?”
The [Illusionist] jumped. He took the cigar out of his mouth.
“That’s right, Master Smith—”
“Enough with that. I don’t care. Nor do I care about Wistram. Or petty Walled Cities or anything else. I just move metal. I was happy enough to drink myself to death. Or so I thought. That damn Human. Just—tell me something. In her inn. She has a Hobgoblin, right?”
The [Mages] exchanged a worried glance. Maviola just narrowed her eyes and looked around. Palt nodded slowly.
“One. Numbtongue.”
“Right. I saw that bugger a few times. Uses a sword, right? Longsword? Decent steel but someone’s notched it a thousand times.”
“Yes…”
The Dwarf nodded. He’d known that before. He didn’t bother asking if it was the preferred weapon; odds were the Centaur didn’t know and Goblins used whatever they could grab.
“Where’s my crystal and fire, apprentice?”
He roared. The crowd jumped. Emessa, though, was used to it.
“Heating up, master! Any pick on steel?”
She had billets ready for him. Pre-made. Pelt knew the steel on each was perfect, but he still chose carefully, examining micro-fragments. The minutiae of the alloy material in the steel itself. He selected one, grunted.
“It’ll do. Heat it up. Now—I’m ready.”
There he stood. The crowd was murmuring. At last, one of them called out. She was a [Smith]. A Human woman, talented for her brief time. That was the thing. Smiths leveled faster the shorter their lifespans.
Ah, but true skill took decades. Centuries, even. That was the unfairness. Pelt felt for these young children. He had been born with an advantage—and he hadn’t squandered it. Every day of his youth he’d swung a hammer. And he had longer than them left to live, even with diluted blood running in his veins.
But don’t scorn them. The Dwarf inhaled. And then he bellowed.
“That’s right, Mistress Smith! Have you not heard of the tradition of every Master Smith who has mastered at least five of the great metals beyond steel?”
