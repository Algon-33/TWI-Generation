The [Princess]’ jaw dropped. She nearly walked into Wilovan. The Gnoll tipped his hat. So did Ratici.
“Pardon me, Miss.”
“Oh, sorry—Kevin! What do you mean?”
Lyonette hurried after Kevin as the two Gentlemen Callers watched Kevin walk by. Joseph, grumbling, went past them for another load. Kevin shrugged as he walked towards the basement.
“I don’t want to be a [Laborer]. I think I got…[Layabout]? [Beggar], from Invrisil. Um—[Rider] when we were on the horses…what were the other two? [Potter], oh yeah…I turned them all down. I think I’m a Level 4 [Warrior]. That’s about it. I should probably have gotten rid of the [Warrior] class.”
Lyonette stared. But she would have taken them all! Except [Layabout]. And maybe [Beggar]. She searched for words.
“But why? You could get a class from working here! If you keep working—you could get to a high level! Strength-enhancing skills! Don’t you want that?”
The young man shrugged. In the basement he put the flour down on a large pile of bags of flour. He turned to Lyonette.
“Sure. Strength Skills would be cool. But I don’t want the [Laborer] class.”
“Why?”
Lyonette snapped. She was getting angry again, with Kevin more than the others. She had wanted to level so much she’d run away from home! And he—
Kevin, unfazed, looked at her.
“Because that’s not me. I’m not a [Laborer]. Or a [Beggar].”
The [Princess] paused. Kevin went on after a moment.
“I don’t know what I am. But I don’t want to be those things. Do you? I thought I wanted to be a [Warrior]—but I don’t like killing things. That was a kid’s dream. I’m happy to help. But this isn’t what I want to do with my life. You know?”
He looked at Lyonette. And the [Princess] slowly nodded. She…understood that.
She was a [Princess]. She couldn’t have been a [Dishwasher].
“But if you need money…if you had to work.”
“I’ll work. But that’s what I do. That’s not my class.”
It was a perspective from Earth, different from Ryoka’s, which was denial, or Erin’s. Kevin dusted his hands.
“Alright, back to the job. Right?”
“Right. Sorry. For saying…”
“No, it’s cool. I know we’re a pain.”
Kevin grinned at Lyonette. She flushed a bit. They knew?
“It’s just…what can you all do?”
The Californian man rubbed at his hair.
“I don’t know. But that’s because we’re from Earth. I didn’t go to college—I was working part-time at this repair shop for bikes. We don’t know what we want to do until we’re older. Is that okay? I know it’s not how this world works. But we don’t know.”
“It’s okay. It’s completely okay. Just as long as you keep looking.”
Lyonette felt for Kevin. That was her. He grinned.
“Great. This is an amazing inn, you know? Erin is really—cool. She made this. Herself. I wish I was that certain.”
Wistfully, he looked around at the stone and wood, the inn that was Erin’s. Lyonette nodded. She looked upwards as they climbed the stairs.
“She made more than that. She’s brought together so many people.”
“Yeah. And there’ve been monster attacks and stuff? Someone keeps mentioning this evil skeleton. And Celum. Heavy stuff. It’s like—terrorism. You know?”
“Not at all. But I wish we could do something. Erin’s door is doing a lot. But what can you do?”
Kevin was shrugging. How could you help a city after devastation? With widespread, organized help, like Olesm was doing. But if you weren’t Liscor’s [Strategist] or didn’t have a magical door, what then?
He caught sight of something as they were nearing the top of the stairs. Kevin paused and Lyonette nearly ran into his back.
“Whoa. Dude. What’s that?”
Something was lying in a corner of the basement. Lyonette peered down.
