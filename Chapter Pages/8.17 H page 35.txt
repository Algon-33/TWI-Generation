“You’re dead.”
Rags stared at the Goblin, speaking almost accusingly. Pyrite shrugged.
“Mm. Yes.”
“How?”
Rags’ voice quivered. She reached out, not wanting to—wanting to touch him. She saw it. She knew it. Him. Yet not him. This body was a vessel.
“The world is strange. Rags. Chieftain. It is good to see you.”
The other Goblin slowly reached out. He touched Rags’ shoulder, blinking.
“You are taller.”
“Pyrite. I’m—I’m sorry.”
The [Great Chieftain]’s voice quivered. She looked up at him, and saw the moment he died. Laughing in the face of the Human [Lord]. Doing what mattered most, as he saw it.
Mrsha stared up at the two Goblins, wrath forgotten. Suddenly, the little female Goblin looked so old. Older than Mrsha. Old, and sad, and…like Relc. Like so many warriors, like Zel. Like…
Pyrite’s claws tightened around hers. His lips moved upwards.
“Why? I won. You lived. And—I got to see you again.”
“I—”
The grip tightened. For one second, Rags felt the warm grip. She looked into Pyrite’s eyes. Then—the crimson gaze unfocused.
Numbtongue’s grip loosened. He let go, stepped back, shaking his head. He caught himself—looked down.
Rags met the [Goblin Soulbard] for the first time in the [Garden of Sanctuary]. Tears in her eyes. She didn’t wipe them away. She looked at Numbtongue, seeing him now.
“Numbtongue?”
“Yes. That’s me. You’re…Rags. The Ch…Badarrow’s Chieftain.”
He croaked. He swayed on his feet, surprised and unsurprised. Tired. Somewhere—the Horns were braving death. He didn’t want it.
He had too many ghosts already. They whispered. A ghost of a Goblin Lord sat in his head.
Do I know her? Do I…?
A broken fragment of memory. Sitting with…with…a giant? His brother, and this Goblin? Talking? Arguing?
The ghost of Reiss spoke, but it was broken. Half-lost. Numbtongue heard Shorthilt too, and Pyrite.
Barely remember this Goblin, when Chieftain Garen was alive. Remember Redscar? He serves her? Is she good at fighting? 
The whisper of the Goldstone Chieftain.
She looks older. Taller. More tired. I wish I had not died. Who will support her now? She is so young. She will be a better Chieftain than I.
Three ghosts. Too many. He wanted no more, even if the others were unseen. He felt them weighing him down.
“Numbtongue. Badarrow told me about you. Your brother—Rabbiteater—went to Terandria.”
“I know.”
Numbtongue’s eyes closed. He had seen his brother, as Drassi delivered the news. Rags looked at him. She looked around the [Garden of Sanctuary].
“There is much to say, Numbtongue. Many questions. Is—is Pyrite gone?”
“No. Here. Only for a minute a day. A minute, ten seconds.”
Numbtongue touched his breast. Rags looked at him.
“How?”
“[Soulbard]. I don’t know.”
He shrugged, helplessly. Rags looked at him, searching his features, his thinner frame for…something. Some hint of the dead.
“Is Garen there? Eater of Spears? …Anyone else?”
“No. Just Shorthilt. And Reiss.”
Her eyes went wide. Numbtongue croaked, his voice rasping, unused to water. He saw Mrsha shyly climbing up the hill. She waved at him.
“Reiss is broken. I—no more ghosts. They are all gone.”
“I see.”
The two Goblins were strangers, they realized. Perhaps, for once, true strangers. Neither one was just a Goblin meeting another.
Once, Garen Redfang had sent some of his warriors to kill an [Innkeeper] when Rags had just met the Redfangs. She did not remember who had left. Numbtongue barely recognized her.
Badarrow’s Chieftain. Rags had heard the pause. She didn’t question it, but she did study the other Hobgoblin, seeing how worn he looked. How sad. This was his place, though.
