Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)
Page 50
The young man held his breath. There was no way this was going to work. But Captain Rasea struck him as the only person it might work on. She was staring at him.
“A first voyage. Aye, I remember mine. I sailed through a storm in a tiny schooner. I found no treasure. But I dared the seas. And I…”
Her eyes grew misty. She stared past Wil. He spoke, carefully.
“We’d consider it a boon. Just this once.”
“Captain.”
The Centaur had folded his arms. He was glaring. But Captain Rasea was actually wiping at a tear.
“Shut up. I’m thinking. Adventure. My crew. Not one of you joined me to die of old age. Or even for the riches of it, did you?”
She looked at the [Pirates] on the Illuminary. They shook their heads, laughing. Some rolled their eyes. But they were looking at her. Captain Rasea Zecrew grinned.
“Nor I. In fact—we dare the seas to take on the greatest challenges! We don’t know what caution is! Do we prey on easy targets?”
“Only if we’re out of drink!”
The Gnoll [Helmsman] called out! Rasea laughed.
“Exactly! I don’t want to die safe, like my sister! I want to see the world! See the greatest terrors and glories the world has for me to witness! If I live to a ripe old age, I won’t die in anyone’s bed, especially my own! Before the end…I’ll take the best of crews and a ship worthy of a legend and set sail for the final sea.”
She pointed towards the horizon. Everyone stared past her. Towards the sun. And past it—so far you couldn’t see.
“The end of the world. The Last Tide. If we live to that age, crew. I promise you, we’ll sail over the edge.”
Captain Rasea spoke to her crew, her eyes shining. Captain Lasc murmured.
“Madness.”
The woman’s gaze swung around. She locked eyes with the [Storm Captain].
“Madness? Aye! Perhaps! But what man or woman who dares the seas isn’t but touched? And there’s something there. Past the end of the world.”
She pointed again, urgently.
“There are stars beyond the world’s end. I’ve seen it myself. Surely they shine down on something. But the Last Tide swallows all ships. Even fleets. Brave [Captains] and crews have dared it. None have returned. So they must not have been high-level enough. Although stories say…”
She paused. And looked at Wil.
“Someday. Aye. One last adventure. But for now? I respect your game, Lord Kallinad. And you’ve a tongue like silver. I see what you want. And I raise you this.”
She swept the hat from her head again. Wil tensed. But Rasea pointed up. Towards the second flag, flying below the pirate’s flag.
“You have your adventure! By the flag of Savere, I swear you will not be troubled by us on your journey! But should you ask—we’ll come calling for a share of the loot!”
Her crew laughed and cheered. And groaned and swore at their brash [Captain]. Wil stared. He saw Rasea laughing. And she plucked a bottle from her bag of holding.
“I swear by home. So drink with me and let’s seal the bargain.”
She smiled. Shining. Perhaps it was a [Pirate]’s mercy. But the students stared at Wil, awed. He looked at Rasea. A madwoman. But you couldn’t help but like her kind of insanity.
She burned with adventure.
“Can I join her crew?”
Yerranola murmured. Rasea heard as a plank was lowered. She strode across it and winked at the Selphid.
“Apply after you graduate! We could always use a good [Strategist].”
The Selphid’s mouth dropped. And Wil saw Rasea pouring a glass for him. She held it out and they touched the glasses. Rasea drank the strong liquid down. And he did the same. He coughed and she laughed and slapped him on the back.
