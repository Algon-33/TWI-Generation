Interlude – Embria

“If you became Watch Captain, I’d think about it. Later.”
“Right. Later.”
Relc smiled. Embria walked out the inn’s door. Erin held her breath. She stared at Relc.
“Does that mean you’re going to run for Watch Captain?”
Relc shook his head. The [Guardsman] sat at his table, staring at the remains of his plate. Then he smiled wearily, and looked at her.
“She said no, Erin.”
“Oh.”
“It’s okay. I think—”
Relc abruptly got up. Embria, who was walking down the street, heard the door open behind her. Relc bellowed down the street of Liscor.
“Hey kid! What time is morning practice? Your [Captains] and officers aren’t nearly as good as they were when I was in the army. They could use a good example. When do you train in the morning?”
Embria’s heart skipped a beat. She turned, laughing.
“It hasn’t changed! It’s the same as always! Come on by whenever!”
“Sure!”
Relc grinned. The door closed, and he stepped back. Erin stood next to him. She stared up at him.
“You don’t remember what time it is.”
“Nope.”

Wing Commander Embria walked back. Towards her barracks. Towards the only home she really knew. And she knew that tomorrow she’d have to deal with the High Command’s new orders. With Lism. With Shield Spider nests and perhaps the issue of a father who was too lazy to wake up in the morning. Or, conversely, a group of [Soldiers] who would not be happy to see him.
It didn’t matter. What mattered was a realization that Embria had. A strange feeling. Something had happened today. Something quiet, wonderful; something Embria hadn’t known could even happen.
Because she’d always had a father. Now? She had a friend.
