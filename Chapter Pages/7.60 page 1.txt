The [Assassin] hesitated. He looked at the others, almost embarrassed.
“One of the few acquaintances she has. She’s paid you visits for more than just deliveries.”
“Just to deliver things from my daughter. I don’t know her at all.”
The [Farmer] had a bow. And he had shovels, pitchforks—none of which came to hand. He was no killer, either. The [Assassin] looked at him, almost pityingly.
“Blame yourself, [Farmer]. There’s not many on our list. And you’re by far the easiest.”
The others. Fierre, an Information Broker, used to watching her back. Mad Madain? A former Gold-rank Adventurer? A [Fistfighter] in Invrisil? Forget the damned inn.
“Who will miss a [Farmer]? Step out and we’ll make it quick.”
Lupp had the door in his hands. He pushed—but one of the [Assassins] was holding it open.
“I don’t know her.”
A lie. The [Assassin] produced a red, glowing stone. He offered it to Lupp. He did not look…happy to do this. Just resigned. Tired.
The Guild of Assassins was burning. But neither Lupp nor Ryoka had considered that even if the Faces were massacred, the Guild broken—they could still find one or two agents to take vengeance.
“You don’t have to do this.”
He tried one last time. The [Assassin] in front looked at him.
“You’re friends with Ryoka Griffin. She destroyed our home. Will it be slow or quick, farmer?”
The old man’s heart beat too quickly. He was shaking. Like other people in this situation, he was searching for a way out. But few attempts on his life had been made like this. A [Mugger], a [Thief]—a confrontation at a tavern.
This—was different. The [Farmer] looked at the [Assassins]. If he shoved the door closed and went to run—
They’d put a bolt in his back before he even took a step. The [Corn Farmer] looked at them. Then…he let go of the door.
“I know Ryoka Griffin.”
They stirred. The [Farmer] opened and closed his hands.
“I know that young woman. She’s a friend. Not one I knew long. But I think I knew her well enough. She was so sad. Too sad for a girl her age. Younger’n my daughter, even.”
He was shaking harder. His eyes blurred a bit. Lupp had to say it, though.
“I saw her on that orb. Running for her life. Defying your Guild. She never looked—”
He swallowed. Then smiled through the tears.
“She never looked happier. She flew. I was never prouder of anyone. If you’re here to kill me for being her friend—d-do it. I’ll never regret knowing the Wind Runner.”
Lupp’s voice stumbled a bit. He wished he’d said his last words as bravely as he thought them, with confidence and daring.
…It was enough. The [Assassins] listened, politely. Then, the one in front nodded.
“Said well enough. Do it.”
The one with the crossbow raised it. Lupp closed his eyes.
Snap. A bowstring cracking.
Thud.

Lupp cracked one eye open. He saw the [Assassin] collapse. An arrow was sticking out of his head.
The scarecrow had shot him in the face.
The scarecrow had—?
The [Assassins] whirled. A second arrow knocked the leader down. He screamed as he tried to drag it out of his thigh. Lupp stared. He fell back, as the other two crashed around the side of the house, for cover.
Lupp was stunned. He didn’t know what was happening. He certainly wasn’t about to fight or take cover more effectively. He just had one thought.
I’ve leveled up. I’ve gained [Awaken Scarecrows]. No—[Automated Scarecrows]. I didn’t hear it. I must have leveled—
He realized, a moment later, that this wasn’t true. The big hint was the shouting voice.
“Take them!”
