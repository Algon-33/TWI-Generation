The Goblins around her started. They looked at her and then at each other, but slowly the crossbows lowered and pointed at the ground. The Humans stared. Lady Bethal stared as Rags urged her wolf forwards a pace. Rags met the [Lady]’s eyes.
“You killed Goblins.”
Bethal blinked at her. This wasn’t what she’d expected. Rags repeated herself again, urgently.
“You killed Goblins. You. But we—not kill you. You are…prisoner. Like other two.”
“What?”
A scoffing, angry sound came from the male [Knight]. But Bethal held up a hand. She stared at Rags.
“Other two? Do you mean Sir Kerrig and Lady Welca? Are they alive?”
“Yes. They prisoner. You. Prisoner.”
Rags didn’t know why she was saying it. But the image of shooting Lady Bethal through the chest, the thought of pulling the trigger—was hard. She hadn’t attacked this time. She’d been riding. She’d killed Goblins, but Rags had killed Humans. Somehow, it made a difference. Rags pointed.
“Drop weapons.”
“Never.”
The [Knights] behind Lady Bethal bristled. Rags scowled.
“Drop. Or shoot.”
“We will cut down every Goblin here should Lady Walchaís fall!”
One of the [Knights] promised darkly, raising her spear. The Goblins tensed. Lady Bethal frowned.
“Lower your spear, Truvia.”
“Lady Bethal! Surrendering would be a death sentence—”
“I know. Let us go, little Goblin Chieftain. We will not surrender. Let us go.”
Bethal urged her mount forwards a step. The man beside her reached out and she held up a hand.
“Thomast.”
He subsided. Rags stared as Bethal approached. Her gaze bored into Rags’ head. There was a pressure about her. A prickling sensation, as if the air around her were the spines of an animal. But more—she felt vast.
“If my people are alive, I will ransom them. And I will ransom myself and my company.”
“Ransom?”
The word was known, but unknown to Rags. Bethal nodded.
“Pay. It need not come to death, Goblin Chieftain. I will give you a fair price for our safe passage and my people’s return, my honor on it. Will you accept that?”
She pushed and Rags felt the urge to agree. But she bit her tongue, gritted her teeth.
“No. Surrender.”
She raised the crossbow and aimed at Bethal. The [Lady] didn’t flinch, though the two [Knights] and her husband tensed. She stared at Rags curiously.
“So small. So fierce! Are you really a Chieftain?”
The question made the Goblins around Rags shudder with anger. What an insult! Bethal looked around, bemused.
“Are you truly the same kind of Goblins as the ones I know?”
The question went unanswered. Now everyone was staring at Lady Bethal. She looked back at Rags.
“I saw the Goblin King. I met one of his Lords. You are different. Prisoners? Do Goblins do such things? Velan the Kind knew no such mercy.”
Velan the Kind. Rags shuddered. She had to take her finger away from the trigger again or risk pulling it. She looked at Bethal. The woman’s gaze wasn’t hostile. She searched Rags’ gaze.
“Peace, little Goblin. Why do you want us as prisoners?”
“Punish. Hostage!”
Rags growled. Bethal nodded.
“Safety. I understand. But know that my people will not rest until I am returned. I killed your people. I will pay the cost of their lives. In magic and gold.”
“Not enough!”
Her voice was too high-pitched. The Goblins shifted. Bethal didn’t blink.
“It is all I can offer. Please, Chieftain of Goblins. If my [Knights] are truly alive, show me. Offer me goodwill and I will return it.”
“They live.”
“Show me. Let me see them. And I will offer you peace. A boon. Protection from other Humans. Safe passage. Whatever you wish.”
