Her hand—dragged itself down. Esiela found herself aiming straight at the [General]’s Minotaurs again. She struggled.
“Ulyse! I can’t—”
“[Shieldtaunt]. Continue launching spells. Break link and reform on me.”
The old [Mage] hissed. Several of the Minotaurs were striking their shields, and Esiela couldn’t aim at anyone but them.
Flos’ army was doing the same. As the artillery continued its bombardment, [Riders] and [Shieldbearers] and other experts began to bait fire away from the main army. Both sides were struggling to take the targets off each other. And still—the Minotaurs refused to move.

They were taking casualties now. But General Ozem refused to give the order.
“Hold your ground. We are winning this exchange. If we wait long enough, the Humans will run out of magic and arrows!”
His vanguard laughed. It was true; the King of Destruction’s [Mages] and [Archers] couldn’t match the House of Minos’ siege weapons.
For now. The [Master of Artillery] was going to run out of his enchanted ammunition. But the King of Destruction didn’t know how many more volleys he’d endure.
He was coming. And now Ozem’s blood howled.
“Wait. Wait.”
The Illusionist met Neriha first. The First Horn had another axe—two of them, one in each hand. Ozem saw the [Vanguard] accelerating, her own artifacts glowing.
The two hit each other in an instant. Neriha’s axes lashed out in a flurry of blows. Mars’ sword cut the air. [Grand Slash]. Both warriors staggered back; Mars checked herself. Her armor had held. Neriha regarded the cut on her side which had torn the hide armor. She laughed and her second move was to strike at Mars with an overhead blow. The [Vanguard] raised her shield—
Ozem looked away. The flash of light from Neriha’s Skill was blinding. He turned back and saw the two striking at each other. And at last—at last—
They were here. The King of Destruction in his vanguard of  Rustängmarder advanced in behind the first two waves. Ozem stirred.
“Greathammers of Hammerad. You will engage the King of Destruction. Sharphorns, advance.”
The first rank of Minotaurs moved past the [Lineholders]. They were singing.
“Hammerad calls.”
They raised the huge, one-handed hammers each one carried, along with the tower shields. To their side, Ozem’s vanguard was waiting.
“[General]. Where is our target?”
“With me. Axebearers of Maweil, you have the honor of the first contact. To the ends of the world, Maweil sails! Forwards!”
Ozem of Maweil raised his axe. The Axebearers strode forwards.
“The King of Destruction!”
The Humans howled. They flooded across the ground as the oldest Minotaurs walked at them, each one bearing a two-handed battleaxe. The Sharphorns followed.
Closer. Ozem saw the King of Destruction bellowing his fury. The artillery boomed. The [Onslaught General] bared his teeth.
The Axebearers met the Human horde staggered, spread out. The Humans advanced shields up. They looked up.
Up, at the sons and daughters of Minos. The Minotaurs towered above them and swung down their axes. The first one spoke.
“[Whirlwind Cleave].”
She stepped forwards and swung her axe. The enchanted edge swung horizontally, in a vast arc. And the [Soldiers] of Reim died.
“[Hammer Blow].”
The Minotaur standing down the line brought down his axe. The impact was like a small detonation. He swung his axe up, looked around. The Humans stared at their dead comrades in front of him, tried to push forwards.
“[Great Swing].”
The [Veteran Axebearer] used a second Skill. Five Humans vanished and he brought his axe back. Almost perfunctorily, he raised an arm.
“[Phantom Bracer].”
