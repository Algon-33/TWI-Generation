Zevara stared at the dark Antinium. Her eyes widened. The Grand Queen lurched upwards, alarmed.
“That is not part of the plan! Why did you order this, Free Queen?”
“I did not. They disobeyed me.”
The Free Queen spoke quietly. The five Queens went still.
“Aberration?”
“No.”
“What, then?”
The Free Queen didn’t answer. Belgrade and Anand looked up. Bird tried to sit up.
“Pawn is going? With the colorful Soldiers?”
“Yes.”
The Free Queen watched them march. She felt them in her mind. Both she and Klbkch watched them go. And they thought as one.
“Unacceptable. Unacceptable. Order them back. Recover them. The Hive cannot lose an asset. The battle must be lost. Do you hear me? Free Queen? Free Queen?”
The puppet was raising its voice and the Grand Queen spoke sharply through her scrying mirror. The Free Queen glanced towards her. And in that moment she made her decision. She bent down low, towards the puppet and opened her mandibles. The little copy of the Queen bent back. The Free Queen spoke one word.
“What?”
The Antinium in the chamber stared. The little Queen and the Grand Queen hesitated.
“What do you mean, what? I gave you orders. Carry them out.”
The Free Queen stared. She tilted her head from side to side and then shook her head.
“I did not hear that. Can you speak again? Louder? Your connection is breaking up, my Queen. I am afraid I cannot hear your orders. Hello?”
“What is the meaning of this? I said—can you hear me?”
“I can.”
“My audio reception is perfect.”
“Is something the matter? Why can the Free Queen not hear us?”
“I. Wonder why.”
“I cannot hear anything, my Queen.”
The Free Queen repeated herself loudly over the babble of voices. She looked at the Workers. Belgrade and Anand shot each other quick glances. Anand nodded.
“I believe the, uh, vessel has malfunctioned. As has the scrying glass. I am quite deaf to the Grand Queen’s orders. I cannot hear a thing.”
“Nor me.”
Belgrade nodded, his antennae waving about wildly. The Grand Queen spluttered. The Free Queen smiled.
“I hear nothing. Do you, Bird?”
The little Worker looked up at the Free Queen. His voice was small, but distinct. He looked towards the ceiling. Towards the marching Soldiers.
“I hear laughter. They’re laughing. And so are you.”
The elation in the Free Queen turned to surprise. Shock. She stared down at Bird, tuning out the Grand Queen. Had he just—
The Free Queen kept looking at Bird. Her mandibles opened, and then her head turned. Her attention snapped back to Klbkch. Above, she saw the reaction to the Painted Soldiers play out, on the walls, on the battlefield, and across the world.

“What in the name of love are those things?”
“Send word to Lord Veltras! The Antinium are on the march!”
“It’s only a hundred! Only—”
The Human army stared as the Antinium emerged seemingly from the ground. Tyrion Veltras stared as the Painted Antinium marched forwards, across the Floodplains.
“Jericha. What are those Antinium? A new variant?”
“They’re—we sighted them around Liscor previously but—we have no knowledge of them, Lord Veltras. They’re…new.”
“New?”
Tyrion stared at the Soldiers. They looked just like ordinary Soldiers. But the paint on their bodies. That was different. On any other species, he would dismiss it as decoration. But the Antinium had no decoration.
“There are only a hundred of them.”
“But are they going to reinforce the Goblins? Attack both sides? What?”
“We should ready a defense. Just in case. Attack them from afar, even. If they close—”
Tyrion turned to the arguing [Strategists].
“No. We hold back. Watch them.”
