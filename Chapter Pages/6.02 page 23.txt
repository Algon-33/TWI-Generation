The Drake looked at her as if she was insane. Lism was still arguing, following the [Guardsmen] at a safe distance. One of the Gnolls with a bow and no arrow nocked just stared at Numbtongue as he bent to touch the hot water. The day manager groaned.
“He’s never seen a bath before? He’s tasting the water.”
“That’s a monster for you.”
Lism interjected unhelpfully. A Drake who’d been following the strange procession looked at Lism.
“That’s the same Goblin that lives in the Human’s inn. He was one of the ones who fought for the city.”
“So? It’s a monster.”
“I’ve never heard a monster speak. Or cry.”
“Oh? And I suppose you want to take a bath with that thing? Look at it!”
Lism began to argue with the Drake. Meanwhile, Numbtongue had wandered out of the bathhouse. Zevara left the arguing pair of Drakes behind as a few more people raised their voices.
From bathhouse to an alchemist’s shop. And then the Adventurer’s Guild. Numbtongue stared at it for a long time before going in.
“Numbtongue?”
Selys had heard what was going on. She still jumped at seeing him. Numbtongue wandered up to the desk. He stared at something on it. Zevara grew pale. So did Selys.
A bunch of Goblin ears were sitting on the desk. Bounties being turned in. The adventurers standing in line turned pale. They’d been out hunting the undead zombies. Numbtongue stared at them. His face barely changed.
“Bounties? Adventurers?”
“That’s—that’s right.”
Selys stared at Zevara. The Drake pointed, and an adventurer swept the ears into a bag of holding. Numbtongue looked at him.
“Ears. How much for Goblin ears?”
“It’s—it’s just to keep count of the undead. They’re zombies. Ghouls. It’s not—”
“How much?”
“A copper coin for a pair. If they’re Hobs, silver.”
Numbtongue looked over at an adventurer. A Human with a scar over one eye. One of Gemhammer, Earlia’s adventurers. He pointed to his eye.
“I got this fighting Goblins.”
Numbtongue pointed to his chest.
“I got this fighting Humans.”
Then he looked back at Selys.
“Ears. Adventurers get paid? Then pay me.”
“For…?”
Selys’ gaze locked on Numbtongue’s ears with everyone else. He shook his head.
“Ears. We killed Goblins. Big army. You saw. Redfangs. Pay me for them.”
Someone laughed. Numbtongue turned to look at them.
“We’re adventurers. That’s what they told me. We killed an army. Give us a bounty.”
Selys looked helplessly around. No one was there to give her any aid.
“I’m sorry Numbtongue. But I can’t—there’s no way we could afford that. Even if we could calculate how many Goblins you killed.”
Numbtongue waited. The Hobgoblin looked around and nodded.
“Okay.”
He walked back towards the door. There he turned.
“Were we adventurers? Or pets? Because we fought the Raskghar. We found them. We fought Goblins. I didn’t see you there.”
He looked around. And then he was gone.

As a Goblin wandered, Erin walked through the streets. She couldn’t stop crying. Out here, the sadness of it all hit her harder than in her room. Here—she saw Drakes and Gnolls. Laughing, until they saw her. Going about their lives. As if they didn’t care. Well, she cared. And she refused to stop.
They saw her in the street and they stared. Some went up to her ask if something was wrong. Others treated her as if she was doing something illegal. Erin didn’t care.
A fight broke out as she passed. A Gnoll began arguing with a Drake about Numbtongue being in the city. Someone threw a punch. A brawl started after Numbtongue left the Adventurer’s Guild, over a word someone had hurled at his back.
Monster.
