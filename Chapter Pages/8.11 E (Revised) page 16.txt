Zel was gone. And Kasigna rose, dark pits of eyes looking to her.
“Nearly there. Further. Further.”
Only the [Witch] spoke then, urging the two on. Erin wanted to turn. And fight…? Fight what? She had no weapons. But she looked back as Kasigna strode after them.
“How much further?”
The Drake demanded. Erin looked ahead—behind—
Kasigna was reaching for her again. There was no logic to her speed. No defying her touch. Erin raised a punching hand. The other two ghosts turned. Kasigna was frowning. Then something roared. She and Erin looked up.
And flames engulfed her. Erin recoiled. For a second she thought it was Maviola—
But then the Dragon landed. He exhaled again, and silver flame made the thing, Kasigna, shriek. It recoiled, flailing, and fled. It looked like Kasigna—but suddenly, Erin saw rotten features. She smelled decay, corruption, even in this place. Something fled into the distance of this ethereal world.
The three stopped and looked up. And there he was.
A silver Dragon.

Afterwards, the Drake fell to his knees and looked back.
Erin looked around.
She wasn’t breathing hard. Shock rippled through her. Confusion. But it did not overwhelm. There was no mind to race. No lungs or heart to labor.
She—and the three beings standing around her—were there and not there.
It was not a lack of color. Transparency in a visible sense. If there was transparency, it was that the entire world, everything, had a quality of ephemerality to it. Erin did not need explanation.
“This is the land of the dead.”
All three said it.
“Yes.”
The [Witch]. The Drake, who wore armor like Zel had, and the silver Dragon. They looked at her.
She did not know any of them. The two she had known were…
“Are they dead?”
It was a silly question to ask. The Dragon snorted and took wing, flying after the place where the thing had been. Erin didn’t know if it was still Kasigna. It had been…she would have called it dead and rotting, but it had been alive.
Life in death. And with a shock, she realized that’s what she was, too. If the world, that false city next to Liscor had been half-real, she was fully real. Compared to the [Witch] who addressed her, at least.
“Not dead. Worse. Consumed. There is nothing left of them, as there would be nothing of you. I am sorry. They were your friends.”
It was not a question. Erin looked back. She wanted to weep, but it had been too sudden.
“This is…”
“The place where the dead go. And I am Califor. You are Erin Solstice.”
Another matter-of-fact statement. The woman spoke as if this were so and if it were not so, it had better well be so before. Erin looked at her.
“But why? This is the underworld? Heaven? This…this?”
She saw Izril’s lands around her with buildings and trees in the same place.
Layers. What was now, what had been. A reflection of the world. And the ghosts…she stared at the kneeling Drake. He did not weep. Perhaps he could not.
“Why here?”
“Why anything? Come with me. You too, Sserys. We stand too close to the edge of his protection, still.”
Erin started at the name. The Drake slowly rose. He looked at her, and then followed the [Witch]. Erin walked after her, turning.
There was nothing in Izril’s landscape. And she could cross a mile in a moment, in a single ‘step’. There was no sunlight. No light of any kind, really. All of it…was. No darkness, no illumination.
Except there were shadows. Shadows, without light. They seemed to gather and disperse at the edges of her ‘sight’.
“Yes, there are more like that one. Weaker, though. They won’t intrude so long as he guards us. Come on.”
