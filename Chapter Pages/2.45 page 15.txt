“Aaah! Flee!”
 
I see shapes darting away, flying out of the cave. And I hear whispers. I barely pay attention.
 
“That game was stupid! It wasn’t true or right! It—did we waste our time?”
“Is she wrong? Did we…?”
 
Even they think I’ve failed. The faeries leave and I can’t see anymore. Everything is swimming.
I’m crying. I’m actually crying. I sit on the floor and try to wipe my eyes. I was so sure. No—I wasn’t sure, but I thought this was stupid and it was the only thing I could think of.
“I can’t beat you. I can’t even try. ”
No matter what riddle I throw at him, he’s going to solve it. He knows the answer to a paradox. What chance do I have?
I tried to use my brain. I should have just begged. I bend over and bow to Teriarch. He’s staring at me in silence.
“I can’t win. Just—please. I have a friend. I don’t know where she is. I’ll do anything, but please, please help her.”
That’s all I had left. My pride. I give it up at last. I thought I had so much. Once upon a time, I thought I was better. But I’m not.
I’m not stronger than anyone. Calruz and Gerial and the Horns of Hammerad humbled me. I’m not faster either; Val outran me easily. I’m not braver than Erin, or smarter than Teriarch. I’m just…
Weak. And normal. And very small.
And desperate.
I lie on the ground, crying like a kid. And I wait for it to be over. I wait to be squashed like a bug into a smear or to be mind-wiped and sent somewhere else to die. But none of those things happen.
I hear the air moving, and a hurricane that sounds like a sigh. And then I feel something touching me.
A massive claw pushes me up gently. I find myself sitting back, and then a massive head snakes down to my level. A voice speaks.
“Sit up. Wipe your face. What did you say your friend’s name was?”
My eyes widen. But the eye that looks into mine is not angry, and the voice is soft. I stare up, and Teriarch blows a plume of smoke upwards.
“I…suppose I could spare my time for a spell. Scrying is not difficult, and a teleportation spell is quite easy if need be. I just need her name.”
“Erin. Erin Solstice.”
I breathe the words. Teriarch mumbles the name, and then he traces something in the air. I see something shimmering in the air, and he sniffs at it. He stares at something that flickers. His eye widens.
“Oh.”
He stares at me. I look back at him, heart pounding. But then the Dragon shrugs. He looks at me oddly, and then speaks.
“The spell will take a while to activate. But it will find your friend unless she is as peculiar as you are. I grant you the hospitality of my home, Ryoka Griffin. You may wait here until it is finished. And maybe you can tell me a riddle in the meantime.”
I stare at him. He’s a Dragon, a thing of immortal years. But as he lowers his head, he looks a bit more Human, or a bit more like me. There’s something in his eyes that makes me think he’s ancient beyond years, and unknowable. But then I see a bit of kindness.
Like an old man wiping away a kid’s tears. I breathe in, and out.
And then I sit up.
“Well. I do know more riddles.”
“Excellent. Tell me one.”
“Have you heard of an enigma?”
“A what?”
“A code.”
His eyes shimmer.
“I know many codes.”
“Then figure this one out. The riddle goes like this:
The noblest name in Allegory’s page, 
The hand that traced inexorable rage…”
And I see a Dragon smile.
I smile too.
