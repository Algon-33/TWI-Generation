Someone fell onto the ground. Shorthilt turned his head for a moment. Wait. He saw a young woman curled up. He saw—
Numbtongue felt his grip on the sword loosen. He looked back as Shorthilt’s control suddenly vanished. He stared at the figure lying there.
“…Erin?”
Someone was sprawled on the grass outside the inn. It was a Human. A young woman.
A mess of light brown hair mixed with a hint of orange covered half of her face. Her skin was pale, not white. But just pale. Her eyes were hazel. They were half-closed. Opening. Closing. Blinking slowly in shock.
Disbelieving. She’d changed back to plain clothes, and put on her iconic apron on top. Her fingers were still smudged with ink. A dropped kitchen knife lay on the grass next to her.
Erin clutched at her chest and stomach. Staring at the blood, seeping from between her fingers. A rush of blood left her body. It ran onto the grass and the ground outside of The Wandering Inn.
It was an accident. A chance moment. An [Innkeeper] returning to her home on foot because she thought the magic door was broken. A vengeful unit of [Soldiers].
A dodging Hobgoblin. And a target, an enemy of a Drake City.
“Erin?”
Lyonette halted by the door. Badarrow lowered his bow. Below—the Drakes scrambled back. Their [Captain] was shouting.
“Target down! Back up! Back!”
They ran. Numbtongue just stared. Why was she here? She—the crossbow bolts had—
“Erin?”
She tried to sit up. And he saw six shafts of wood, fletched with bright colors—sticking out of her chest. He dropped his sword.
“Erin!”
Lyonette ran as Todi stared. He roared over his shoulder.
“Miss Solstice is hit! On me!”
They charged out of the inn. But the Hobgoblin was faster. He was at Erin’s side in a moment. She stared up at him, gasping, her mouth red with—
“Ow. Ow. I—I’m hurt, I think. Numbtongue? What happened? I think—”
She stared. She’d heard shouting. Had—had—
“You shot. Hold still. Healing potion—”
Numbtongue fumbled with his belt. Erin flopped backwards. He stared at her, producing a glowing bottle.
Potion. It was all going to be alright. Idiot! Idiot, careless—
He yanked the bolt out of her stomach. It took blood with it, and flesh. Erin made a sound—but he had to remove the bolt to heal. His fingers shook as he opened the potion Octavia had given him and poured it on the wounds.
He waited. The wound began to close—
The flesh would knit—
Nothing happened. The Hobgoblin stared at the potion. Was it a mana potion? He tossed it aside, dragged another out of his belt. Erin was gasping.
“I have one on my belt…”
She saw him yank at the cork—then smash it in one hand. The healing liquids poured onto her chest. Numbtongue felt the shards of glass digging into his flesh—then the pain vanishing.
It was a healing potion. He watched it pour into Erin’s wound—
And then nothing. Numbtongue stared. The magical liquid ran with the blood. He thought he saw the tiniest movement of flesh—then it stopped.
“What? Why?”
Lyonette skidded to a halt, panting. She saw flashes of light as Todi’s group pursued the Drakes. But Erin—she stared down at the [Innkeeper]. Erin was opening and closing her mouth.
“What are you doing? Heal her! H—”
She rounded on Numbtongue. Then she saw the broken bottle in his fist, the empty one.
“It didn’t work.”
He dumbly stared up at her. Numbtongue knew the answer to this one. Pyrite was saying it. Shorthilt had gone quiet. Lyonette’s eyes flickered. She stared at the bolt he’d pulled out.
