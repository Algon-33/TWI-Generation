Interlude – Numbtongue (Pt.2)

And on. Of Liscor. Of Bugear, who’d died before meeting Erin, but had died fighting for his brothers. Of the battles there. Face-Eater Moths. Raskghar. Face Stealer. And then the end. Not everyone was listening. But that one [Innkeeper] was, a few Drakes, a Gnoll child—and more listening with one ears, frowning, denying—it didn’t matter. They were listening.
Numbtongue shouted the last refrain.
“They are gone, but I remain!”
And he stood up. He didn’t expect applause. And he got it, scattered, a few hand claps. That was all. But that wasn’t the point. The point was the story. Their story. He sat down next to Erin and she wiped her eyes. Pisces, who had been listening, cracked one eye open and looked at Ceria and Yvlon. The two female adventurers were quiet, introspective. He coughed.
“You couldn’t make a play about that.”
“Be quiet.”
Yvlon kicked him hard. He went silent. At their table, Erin turned to Numbtongue.
“What will you call it?”
The Hobgoblin shrugged.
“Needs work.”
And it did. But he had a title already in his head. A song.
The Ballad of the Redfangs.
Erin blew her nose.
“It’s good. But you know…”
“Yes?”
“You don’t have to surrender the stage after one song, Numbtongue. They can’t chase you off. And you don’t have to go. What if you played a song for us? Something we can sing to?”
The Hobgoblin looked at Erin. She smiled at him. And he looked over at Yellow Splatters. The Antinium had been staring at the [Bard]. The [Sergeant] spoke softly.
“The Antinium have no music. Bird sings. But that is all. If you have a song, I would like to hear it. And…sing?”
And Numbtongue’s heart leapt. He stood up and walked back to the stage. Some of the audience groaned. Others shouted that they didn’t want to hear it. And a few looked at Numbtongue and turned their bodies and heads to listen. Only a few. The Goblin had never expected it to be easy.
But he’d remembered why he wanted to be a [Bard]. So he played. At first a song Erin knew and could teach everyone the words to. Then a song he’d created. A riff, with lightning and thunderous chords. And then another song. And another.
And soon it wasn’t that a Goblin was singing a Goblin’s song, but just that he was there. A Goblin [Bard], reminding everyone of the past. Pyrite was in Numbtongue’s head. Not forgotten. And Headscratcher, Shorthilt, all the others, lived on in Numbtongue’s music. They wouldn’t be forgotten. Not yet.
They died. They left us. And we are alone. But we are not gone. Here we are. The guitar sang as Numbtongue stood alone, alone in front of a crowd. But he refused to run. He refused to hide. Here I am. Here we are. We made it. We remain. And we will never let you forget. Here we are. Look at us. See us.
Here we are.

And then it was done. Numbtongue sat in his room. Dozing off with the sun. His claws hurt, and his throat was sore. But he wasn’t unhappy. He was tired. Oh, so tired. And the sun, usually a good incentive, couldn’t keep him awake. The Goblin nodded as he slowly put his guitar away, and then lay down on his bed. He’d probably wake up after nine hours. Six? Four if he needed to.
It might be hard when he woke up. Hard and unforgiving. But Numbtongue had something now. A friend. A reason to keep going, to stay at the inn. Memories. Today they had helped him. Given him words he couldn’t have come up with himself. The skill to fight—they’d saved his life.
