“Yes. So you could dance and be happy. I bought this dress, too. Miss Krshia helped me pick it out.”
Lyonette looked at the dress. She looked at Pawn. And she giggled as she realized something.
“Wait, dance? By myself?”
“Um. Yes?”
The young woman shook her head.
“You know, a ball isn’t really meant for one person to dance alone, Pawn.”
“It isn’t?”
The Antinium was devastated. He looked around wildly.
“I can fix this! I will get Miss Erin! Or Miss Krshia! Just wait—”
He wanted to run off but Lyonette grabbed his hand. It was so sudden that both [Barmaid] and Worker froze. Then Lyonette spoke.
“Erin isn’t who I want to dance with, Pawn. Neither is Krshia. A ball needs two. So does a waltz. Why don’t I dance with you?”
“Oh.”
Pawn turned to Lyonette. He stared at her hand. She held out her other one.
“Take my hand, Pawn.”
“Your hand?”
He hesitated. Lyonette held it out. Pawn took it. She felt his strange, cool, smooth fingers take hers. The shock of contact made her jump and Pawn’s antennae waved wildly.
“Is this—is this how it works? I have seen Erin dancing.”
“She does it a bit differently. A ball is formal. You have to hold your partner. Here, let me show you.”
Lyonette held her hands up with Pawn. She didn’t know what she was doing. She felt flushed, dizzy. Pisces couldn’t be—Krshia was just—she looked at Pawn. He stared back. Lyonette’s head went empty and she let years of training take over.
“Like this. Raise your arms. Stand closer—and step. When I step forwards, you step back. When you step forwards—yes. Keep your feet together. Like this. See? One, and two, and one, and two—”
“Oh. How fascinating. Is this dancing in a ball?”
“A bit. But you don’t just step back and forth. You turn—yes, like this! And there’s more moves. And there would be music.”
“Music? Oh no. I can get some—”
“No. We can dance without it. If you want to.”
“I think I do.”
Pawn held Lyonette’s hand as she showed him the moves of the dance. He remembered them all well. She had to adjust for his different body, his less graceful steps. But as they stepped together, Lyonette stopped feeling silly and remembered. Yes, this was what it felt like? She turned and suddenly the barracks opened up in front of her. It was truly large. She spun with Pawn and though there was no music, suddenly she felt caught up.
“What a strange activity. How pleasing. I am glad you did not grow angry. And I am sorry again for upsetting you.”
The Worker babbled as he waltzed with Lyonette. She wanted to laugh again and suppressed the urge. They danced past the dress stand, ignoring the yellow dress. It wasn’t needed.
“I want to say sorry too, Pawn. I didn’t notice how you felt.”
“No. I did not either. Are you sure I like you? Romantically? I thought that was a thing only Drakes, Humans, and Gnolls did.”
“I’m pretty sure. The signs are all there.”
“Oh.”
Pawn thought about this as they spun. Lyonette showed him how to spin with her. She felt too close to him. She hadn’t been this close to anyone but Mrsha. But she didn’t pull away.
“Should I do something about it? I understand that romantic interests lead to death and fighting.”
“Who told you that?”
“Revalantor Klbkch. He says that a third of the disputes he must settle are based in romantic conflict. Will I start attacking you? I could not bear to do that.”
“No, Pawn. That’s not—do you understand what I’ve been telling you?”
“…Maybe?”
“You like me. You like me romantically. Pawn, that means you might love me.”
“Love?”
