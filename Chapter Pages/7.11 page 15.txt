If you had parents like Wailant and Viceria, it was hard to follow in either one’s footsteps. And—seeing two drunk parents staggering around blasting [Light Arrows] around at night might make you yearn for a bit of normality.
Certainly, the exasperation in Garia’s tone was familiar.
“Dad, I heard you were banned from Celum. And you hit an unarmed [Merchant]!”
“She had it coming. She sicced a bunch of [Mercenaries] on me. Harpy. Anyways, look what I found.”
“I know what you found! You kidnapped Numbtongue! He’s part of Erin’s inn? Remember? You were supposed to visit?”
Viceria sighed.
“Garia, don’t shout at your father. Why is your midriff bared? And what are you wearing? Are you trying to make yourself a target on the road?”
She pointed to Garia’s wrapped chest. Which was exposing her bosom in a way part of Numbtongue appreciated—and her parents did not. Viceria frowned. Garia glared at her.
“Mom! You’re the naked one!”
“And I am naked at home, with your father.”
“In front of a guest!”
“So? He’s not one of them raping Goblin bastards. I’d cut him apart before he did. Don’t be racist, my girl.”
Garia stared at Wailant. Viceria murmured.
“It’s speciesist, dear.”
“Right, that.”
Garia threw up her arms.
“I’m home.”
She looked at Numbtongue. He paused in putting his pants on and waved.
“Hi.”
Garia stared at him. Then she stared, fascinated.
“Oh…hi.”
She didn’t look away. Wailant and Viceria turned to look at Numbtongue. He hurried to put on the pants. Viceria eyed her daughter and smiled. Wailant scowled.
“Alright, clothes on!”

A little bit later, Numbtongue was eating cold rice and dumplings again. He rather liked it cold; Garia was eating it hot, and her parents were sitting around their dinner table.
Garia coming home was a bit of a rare occurrence, or so it seemed to Numbtongue. Her parents were pestering her with questions.
“And you’ve just been running? That’s it?”
Viceria sighed as her daughter uncooperatively described her life in the intervening months since she’d been back. Garia shrugged.
“That’s right, mom. It’s just my job. You know.”
“Nothing interesting happened? At all? No fascinating deliveries?”
“Meet any [Bandits] on the road? Monsters?”
Wailant was sipping from some milk to sober up. That sounded good to Numbtongue so he helped himself. Garia glanced at him and shrugged.
“I mean, a few. But I’m not a big name, Mom. You know that. I’m making more of a name now; I still do the big deliveries of heavy stuff, but I’m saving up for a bag of holding.”
“You could take your father’s old one—”
“I can afford it myself! Besides, it’s good training. And I’m safe. I can wear what I want; I knocked out a [Cutthroat] on the road and he had a horse.”
“Aha! Tell us about that!”
“I kicked the horse and then I punched him. That’s all, dad. I don’t take risks, like Ryoka. But I’m getting better requests.”
“And how many of them are from young men?”
Viceria murmured. Garia flushed.
“Some. And so what? But I’m faster!”
“Any of them try to put their hands on you? Remember what I said about the plague you can catch—”
“Dad.”
“Wailant.”
The man subsided. He glanced at Numbtongue. Then he cleared his throat.
“So, darling girl. You’re uh, looking different again. Been a while since we last saw you.”
“I lost more weight. See?”
Garia indicated her body. Wailant paused.
“Yeah. Good for you? Anyways, here’s Numbtongue. You know him, from the inn?”
Garia paused. She looked at her father and nodded.
