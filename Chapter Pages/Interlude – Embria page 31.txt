Interlude – Embria
Page 31
He looked at his daughter. And his daughter looked back. Relc shook his head. He stared at Lism, and Captain Wikir. His voice was far-off.
“I didn’t do anything heroic. I killed a dead Goblin. And it still wasn’t me that got him. He just stopped. I’ve seen it before. What’s heroic about that? He killed the Goblin Lord. He went through an army—no, two armies and the 4th Company. And you think I stopped him? Besides…”
His voice trailed off. Embria waited for more, but a roar from the crowd drowned out whatever might be said preemptively. One of the candidates had shouted something inflammatory. Both sides pushed forwards, and Embria reached out.
“Let’s get out of here!”
“Right!”
Relc pushed through the crowd, single-handedly driving through the flow of people. He felt a grip on his hand, and when he won clear of the immediate crowd, he looked back and saw Embria was holding his hand. Relc swung his arm.
“Whew. Glad I’m not on duty. It’s going to be a pain breaking up the fights. Where to, kid? Uh, you can let go.”
Embria hesitated. But then she gripped Relc’s hand. He stared at her. She didn’t let go. Relc stared at her clawed hand. He opened his mouth. She jumped in.
“How about the inn?”
Relc closed his mouth on what he had been about to say. He nodded.
“Okay.”
And so they walked. Hand in hand. Embria’s cheeks were flaming with embarrassment, but you would hardly notice with her fiery scales as it was. And the hands? No one noticed as the two walked together at first. But the two whom it mattered to felt it.
“You’ve gotten a lot taller. When was the last time we did this?”
Relc looked down at Embria, mystified. She blinked up at him.
“It must have been around ten years ago. Eight at the least. Remember how I ran away when I was thirteen?”
His hand tightened on hers.
“Yeah. Yeah. I do remember that. And we never did this back in the army, did we? I just got back from the front or something. You were usually asleep.”
“That’s true.”
On they went. Embria took a deep breath as they walked down the street, past people whose lives didn’t matter to her right now.
“Is that why you left? Really? It wasn’t cowardice.”
“Nah. It was.”
She stopped.
“Dad. You don’t need to—”
“What? Lie? I don’t need to. I know what they say about me. I was one of them, remember?”
He looked at her. And he shrugged, looking a bit sad and guilty.
“It’s the truth. I just didn’t want to die. I thought I would. No, I knew I would. I had a nickname. And I was going into every battle with the front lines. I was afraid. Someday, someone was going to lay a trap. Or hire an [Assassin] and get me. I already had a dozen close calls. I didn’t want to die. And you were there. That’s true. So I quit. But it was about me, kid. It always was.”
It wasn’t what Embria wanted to hear. But the bitter pill wasn’t the poison she thought it would be.
“You know, I was serious about you coming back. There’s a bunch of your old friends who made it to the High Command. They’d call you in. You could be a [Captain]. It’s a possibility.”
And she hoped. Oh, she hoped, but she knew what he would say. For a glorious second he hesitated. Then Relc shook his head.
“I wouldn’t be happy there, k—Embria. I couldn’t go back, even if everyone welcomed me with open arms. I was afraid, yeah. But I wasn’t happy, near the end. That’s why I left. I could have died for the army, with my pals I guess. But I wasn’t happy. I didn’t say that either, did I? I’m sorry.”
He looked at Embria. And his grip was very gentle. And she looked up at him. And slowly, she nodded.
“Okay.”
