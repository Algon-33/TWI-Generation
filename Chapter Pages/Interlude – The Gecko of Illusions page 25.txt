Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

She could almost feel him spinning, falling in his head. The City Runner’s throat constricted.
“It is. Listen…you didn’t know. Sit down. Relax. You didn’t know.”
“You have to—”
“Erin, shut up.”
Ryoka turned on the [Innkeeper]. How was she not seeing Relc’s pain? But the Drake just turned away as Erin blinked and Ryoka grabbed at her.
“Nah. I get it already. It’s gotta be true. I keep doing this. Klb would have warned me. Let’s see…”
He stared blankly out a window. Ryoka turned to him.
“Listen, Relc…”
“I’ve got to go.”
He spoke dreamily. The Drake began walking for the door. Erin and Ryoka both followed.
“Relc! Wait! I’m not mad at you. I just—come sit back down. Let’s talk about what to do.”
Erin reached for him, but the Drake was speeding up. He walked out of the common room. Towards the magic door. Drassi disappeared through it with Mrsha. The Gnoll waved excitedly at Ryoka and the City Runner had almost forgotten about the park. She saw a figure disappear through the doorway after the two. But that wasn’t important.
“Relc—”
The Drake paused at the door. He looked back at Erin. In complete darkness, falling again and again…that was what Ryoka thought he must be feeling. But she—did not know him.
“Erin.”
The [Guard] spoke. He leaned on the door, looking very tired. The [Innkeeper] halted.
“Relc?”
“If you’re right…I’ve got to fix this. Save my seat. I’ll make it right. You’ll see.”
His claw tightened on the doorframe. Then the Drake slowly walked into Liscor. Ryoka Griffin stood there. She blinked, once. Erin turned to her.
“What does that mean?”
It meant—Ryoka thought. She saw Relc walking through the city, tail dragging, shoulder slumped. Holding his bag of coins. She breathed a word.
“Oh.”

It meant he was going to do the right thing. Relc was indeed spinning. The world turned upside down and kept throwing him about. He hated it.
Spear—his spear that he always carried was familiar. He knew it. Everything else? He hated how nothing else made sense.
It was such a good thing. It couldn’t be true, could it? But Relc trusted Erin. She had been right. She was—a friend.
You had to stand by friends. 1000%. He had been wrong once. That was Relc. Good old Relc, [Sergeant] Relc, the idiot. Now that he thought about it—it made sense.
“Why would I be doing well in the Golden Triangle if it was real, huh? Me?”
The Drake laughed to himself as he leaned on a wall. He still felt dizzy. Aimlessly, he looked around. Where did he start? They were everywhere.
Start at the last place you were. In the battlefield, you fought the enemy in front of you. Relc clung to that. He began to run.
He ran back through the city, towards his apartment. The bag of gold, his profits from the Golden Triangle in one claw. The gold was real. But it was fake. The Drake, panting, stopped by an apartment next to his house. He hammered on the door.
Eventually, a Gnoll woman opened it. She blinked at Relc.
“Senior Guardsman? Is this about the Golden Triangle? Do you need more money? I haven’t gotten my certificate…”
Relc felt in the coin pouch. With shaking hands, he produced ten silver coins. And looked at them. The Gnoll woman’s enlistment fee. And that was the minimum.
For a long time, the Senior Guardsman stood there. Head bowed. So much so that the Gnoll woman grew nervous. But eventually, he looked up.
