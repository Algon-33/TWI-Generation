The [Prince] took to the air in a single jump that carried him from the edge of the arena high overhead. Slowing, rising, until he reached the zenith of his arc and fell like a meteor towards Yvlon and Septis. The [Bodyguard] threw himself back and the Gold-rank Adventurer, the [Prince], struck the ground.
“Zenol?”
He rose, sword slashing out. Septis deflected it with an oath, then the second blow. Zenol advanced. Yvlon heard him whisper something.

Barelle the Bard stopped at the head of the stairs, next to Cognita Truestone, as Yisame rose to her feet. The [Bard] murmured as he saw the [Prince] land.
“[Like a Lion, He Leapt]. [He Fought With All His Pride].”
The world flashed. Barelle saw Zenol, standing in the arena, next to Yvlon Byres. Then—over a dozen figures. His [Bodyguards] leapt out of the air around him, weapons drawn.
The [Elite Bodyguard], Septis, stared at Zenol’s reinforcements, his pride. Like a lion, the [Prince] charged him.
Prince Zenol Isphel of Nerrhavia’s Fallen knocked the blade of Septis, bodyguard of Prince Esceit Quarein, down. In the Coliseum of Monarchs, before the [Queen] and all gathered, his sword swung once.
Septis’ upper torso collapsed, cut from the neck across down to his left armpit. Zenol flicked his sword and blood showered the sand. Then he turned.
Yvlon Byres looked at him as he offered a hand. The [Bodyguards] of Quarein stared as the [Silversteel Armsmistress] looked at Zenol. Then she laughed and clasped his hand. For a second, they stood there, then Zenol turned. He pointed his sword and the [Bodyguards] of the Isphel family followed their [Prince] and the Silver Killer into a charge.
[Gladiators], a [Prince], and an adventurer—no, two adventurers in the Coliseum of Monarchs.
Barelle the [Bard] let out a long sigh. Beside him, a woman folded her arms. Cognita stared down at the drama below.
“Is this what you and the [Prince] rushed to see? Blood and death and politics, Barelle? I expected more of you.”
Her green-jade eyes turned to meet his. The [Bard] bowed deeply to her.
“Not that, Miss Cognita. Stories.”
His head rose with an appreciation of a [Bard]. Someone who could say they had been there and seen it with their own eyes. But then, he was a storyteller in his own way.
A [Reader] half-stood, staring down at the two Gold-rank adventurers. Zenol and Yvlon. One who had rushed across the ocean to her, even at the cost of making mortal enemies. The kind of thing that had less consequences in a book. Here?
They looked up at her, then. So it was amidst a blood feud, war with the King of Destruction, and everything else that Queen Yisame met Yvlon Byres at last. Prince Zenol Isphel kneeling by her side.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I forget sometimes. I’ve done this six years, but it’s never easy. I get off break, technically refreshed in body and sometimes mind…and I have to try hard.
Well, if I didn’t I’d be coasting and who’d want that? M-me. But some chapters are hard to write, some are easy. It’s a combination of factors that has something to do with butterflies flapping.
We’re off break and it’s going to be a long month? I have chapters until the New Year where I’ll take a longer break…or will I? Normally, we end around a volume, but I’m almost positive there’s no way that’ll happen.
Also, Christmas I usually have a chapter out by, but you never know.
