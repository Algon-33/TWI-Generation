“Okay. What’s up, Shadows?”
The other three turned to the one Gnoll with a female voice. She spoke behind her blurred features.
“News from my contacts. But before that—did you bring us any steak, Coinpurse?”
“No.”
“Come on. We want good food. Throw us a bone.”
“I’ll cave in your skulls. I do have a new recipe. It’s corn-based. Dried corn. Good snack.”
“Really? You’ll have to invite me over.”
Spellcaster nudged Coinpurse. The other Gnoll growled.
“Can we please stay on focus?”
“Why is dried corn a good snack?”
“I’ll tell you later. Shadows, what’s up?”
The other three Gnolls were fairly relaxed, despite this being a secret meeting. They’d done this before. Shadows sighed.
“Fine. Remember Liscor? Apparently the person we hired—Bearclaw—is dead. Or on the run. It doesn’t matter. She attacked a Senior Guardsman in Liscor.”
Silence. Then Coinpurse cursed.
“I thought you said we could hire her!”
“I said she’d do her job. And she’s the only one we could get!”
“Well, what do we do? That poor child’s in Liscor. We’ve all seen the scrying orb.”
“I saw her again this morning. Nearly caught up in those riots.”
“Better than being in Liscor. Those stupid Humans. No one’s even thought to dye her fur? Or is she being protected some other way?”
Coinpurse was nodding. Wanderer shifted.
“The point is that Shadows lost her contact. I think one of us has to go get her. There’s no other safe way.”
“I’ve got a job.”
“So do I.”
Coinpurse and Shadows instantly raised their paws. Wanderer and Spellcaster eyed each other.
“I’m teaching S—the Child. Er, I mean, the other one. We’re going to have to come up with new nicknames.”
“How about Child A and Child B? They’re both brats.”
“How about you shut up, Shadows? We’ll think of that another day. I never liked hiring a criminal.”
“Thanks, Coinpurse. She would have done her job!”
Shadows and Coinpurse growled at each other. They were diametrically opposed, in philosophy and positions at the table. They were all—the same. But that didn’t mean they all got along. It was just—you had to stick together.
“Spellcaster is teaching Child. So—it leaves you, Wanderer. You’re the best choice, anyways.”
“I hate going through the Bloodfields. Even going around it is a pain.”
The Gnoll grumbled. Coinpurse tapped the table.
“Haven’t you heard? There’s a magic door. Pallass. You can skip all the way to Liscor from there.”
“Really? Salamander snacks, I’ll do it, then! Just give me some coin for the road. And maybe some gear.”
The other three Gnolls looked at Wanderer.
“You think there will be trouble?”
“I’m prepared for it. But—I only need a few artifacts. Coinpurse has set me up. Just temporary ones. Scrolls. Potions. Can you get me…two thousand gold, Coinpurse?”
The other Gnoll grumbled. But this was his role.
“I have the coin on me. Here.”
He smacked a bag of holding down. The others murmured. One raised a paw.
“Can I get a thousand gold, Coinpurse?”
“Shut up, Shadows.”
It wasn’t a large cabal, or conspiracy. And there were large ones that these white Gnolls were aware of. This was more just like—a group of four. Five, now. With a few more in other places. Friends. A community in hiding.
And for all their differences, once Wanderer had taken the coin, they grew serious. Shadows looked at Wanderer.
“We have to save that poor child. Wanderer, get her. If you need backup, get word to me from Pallass.”
It was a mission of mercy. By well-meaning people in hiding. And in that sense, it was just a little thing compared to a Wall Lord’s grand shadow-war. It wasn’t something that was supposed to change the fate of a continent.
