“I just woke up.”
Why was she talking to this kid? Ryoka looked around—then decided to wait for clothes and ‘Jericha’. Sammial wrinkled his brow.
“Would you have done it for anyone?”
“Maybe.”
“So not just because we’re important?”
“I guess? It wasn’t purely altruistic.”
“I don’t know what that means. Explain it. And stop using complicated words!”
Ryoka blinked again. Was he—was that an aura? Or was she imagining stuff?
“It means—‘doing good things for nothing’. I did want something from your father. Where is he? Where am I?”
Sammial ignored the question. He stared at Ryoka, looking at her.
“So you brought the cure because you wanted a favor and to do the right thing? Do you want gold?”
If you’re offering, I’ll take it. Ryoka half-shrugged. Sammial tilted his head.
“Are you lying? I don’t feel you’re lying. I can tell, you know.”
“I’m not. I did it because it was the right thing to do and because I needed a favor only your father could help me with.”
Ryoka half-rose. At least to look out the window.
“Did you help father because you’re a slut?”
The Wind Runner paused, one hand on the windowsill.
“…What?”
Sammial was looking at her innocently.
“That’s what the other City Runner called you. She said you did this only to seduce father. And that you got all the other people killed because you were a selfish, greedy bitch. That’s what she said. Then Jericha hit her and tossed her out. I got to watch the guard kick her out. She kept coming back so they had to drub her. She was nasty.”
He said that with some satisfaction. Ryoka’s mouth moved.
“Which City Runner?”
“I don’t know. Purse-a?”
“Persua?”
“Yep. She had the cure, but she was late. Father told Jericha to offer her some money, but she threw a fit and called you all kinds of names. What’s a slut? No one will tell me, even Hethon. Because he doesn’t know either.”
Ryoka’s mouth opened and closed. Persua had been here with the cure? How uncharacteristically brave. And—thrown out and beaten?
Well…even in the darkest night, there was a silver lining indeed. Ryoka shook her head.
“I’m not a—don’t use that word.”
She almost smiled at the thought of Persua mouthing off and—dead gods, why didn’t I wake up for that? Then Ryoka was reminded of something.
Whore. Only, it wasn’t someone calling Ryoka that. It was something the fae had once said to Ceria…
The fae. The party. Ryoka’s smile vanished.
“I have to go. Thank you for telling me, er—Sammy. Is your father…?”
She strode for the door, adjusting the blanket so it wouldn’t reveal anything. The boy blocked the door.
“Stop! I didn’t give you permission to leave! I have more questions! Can you control the wind? You cannot leave a [Lord]’s presence without my permission!”
Ryoka felt someone tug on her shoulders and legs invisibly. She looked back at Sammial. He was scowling at her with regal displeasure.
What a little brat. Ryoka was reminded of herself. She shook her head.
“Sorry, kid. I’ve got to go.”
Sammial pointed.
“You will stay! I command it!”
Ryoka walked to the door, opened it a crack, and looked outside. Sammial stared at her back, open-mouthed.
“I said—why isn’t it working?”
“Sorry. But I have to know—”
The Wind Runner swung the door all the way out and stepped through it. Then she saw a woman—a [Mage]?—striding up the stairs behind the second, older boy. Hethon Veltras and Jericha stared at Ryoka. Ryoka blinked.
“Oh. Um. Hello?”
