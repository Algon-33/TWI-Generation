I sigh. How would I talk to young Ryoka? First, smack her hard. No—I can’t do that. I patiently bend over, and realize that’s patronizing. So I sit down instead, cross-legged.
“I’m giving you advice. I’m not your father, or your—guardian. I’m not Jericha or anyone else, Sammial. But I am telling you, person-to-person. You can’t do that and expect to get away with it. You understand?”
He gives me a long look.
“I know what you mean. Be polite. Make people like you. That’s what Hethon does. But I am a [Lord]. I have pride as a nobleman!”
I scratch my head. Where’s Tyrion? Ah, out riding with the other [Lords] and [Ladies]. Those who didn’t run for the hills the instant the party ended like Lady Ieka and some of the others.
The rest have enjoyed His Majesty’s hospitality, also mainly because they’re trying to figure out what the heck happened? Also also? To eat all of the good food he has. It’s rare so many are in one place and there’s potential here for diplomacy.
Anyways. I’m learning more about Tyrion Veltras, counterpart of Magnolia and the famous [Lord] of war in the north.
He. Sucks. At. Parenting. And I know this might come back to bite me, but I have to say it.
“Okay, Sammy, you’re a [Lord] of House Veltras. So what?”
He blinks at me.
“So, I am a [Lord] and more important than other people.”
I shake my head before he even gets that last part out. Oh no, I have to at least present the counterargument, bad idea or not.
“Sammy, I don’t believe that.”
“Why not?”
He narrows his eyes as if to feel out how offended he should be. I tap my chest.
“We’re all Human. We’re all people. I believe that being a [Lord] means you’re important in one way. But you should still try to be polite. To think about others. Okay?”
“What if I don’t want to? What if other people are stupid and I know what’s best?”
I blink. That’s a Ryoka-question right there. But instead of my parents or teachers or…well, I never liked the answers I got. So here’s a better one. I shrug.
“That’s fair, Sammial. You don’t have to care about people. But you should. Remember the Satyr? The horned lady?”
He nods, cautiously. I smile.
“She would have murdered you for mouthing off. And she’s an extreme example, but your people are no different. Haven’t you ever made…Jericha angry?”
He looks away.
“…Sometimes.”
I just bet you have. I bite my tongue, and keep my voice reasonable.
“Well, Jericha likes you so she puts up with that. No one else has to. Not fellow [Lords], not your people, even. So think about that next time you want to be mean. There are consequences for everything you do. They might not come today, or tomorrow. But they will come.”
He digests that. I’m laying a lot on a kid. But—he’s a kid with an aura. A [Lord], which can’t be fun. He looks at me, and I remember—he was dying of poison less than a month ago. It wears at him and he looks uncharacteristically old.
“Is that true? Then do bad things happen to bad people? Like the [Assassin] who poisoned me and Hethon?”
I bite the inside of my mouth. After a second, I don’t go to true honesty.
“I believe so. And that’s how I try to behave. I try to do good things.”
“Like deliver medicine for me and Hethon.”
“Yep. Anyways. Don’t boss people around because they can hit you. And don’t boss me around. Or spy on me.”
He kicks at the floorboards sullenly. I exhale. Maybe he’s forgotten…
“What about your magic sword? Can I see that? I’m sorry for using my aura.”
Shit. I hesitate.
“—If I tell you, will you promise not to tell anyone? Even your brother? Swear on…your honor as a [Lord] of House Veltras?”
“I swear.”
