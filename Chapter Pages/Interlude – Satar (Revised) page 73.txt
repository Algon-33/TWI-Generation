Interlude – Satar (Revised)
Page 73
Author’s Note: This was a big chapter. I have noticed–I tend to make my edited chapters the most ambitious, the toughest, and the grandest I can.
Not always in action. But I think it’s me pushing myself. If ever there was a reason to have editors…aside from the constant self-improvement? It’s that.
Writing is constantly trying to self-improve. And editors feel, to me, to be one way to continue to improve. I also felt like this was a stronger chapter, and the edits gave more nuance to one part at the end around Fetohep…
You’d have to read the draft to notice the difference. Suffice it to say, I’m glad I got it done, but wow. It’s a lot of words and I worked hard to get it done. It took a while to get edited because I was working on the Hectval arc and my vacation came up, but was it worth it?
Let me know. Hope you enjoyed this story about stories, and I’ll see you next chapter!
