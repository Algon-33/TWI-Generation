I see them falling. My villagers. They’re being pushed back by the Goblins’ relentless assaults. And their morale is weakening. Already three of the Trackers have fallen. Wiskeria screams as the [Shaman] hits her with a bolt of energy that scorches her shoulder black.
They are my people and I cannot help them. In this moment, I know it. I see a young man with a hoe cutting at a Goblin, and watch as it ducks beneath the blade, snarling, and stabs into his stomach.
His intestines come out. I see the Goblin duck away as he collapses. I know his name.
Calop, the name of a root. He is mine.
Mine. I pulled him from the ground. I saved his life. They can’t take him. He is my subject.
But he fades. I see him sagging, see a young woman clinging to him, trying to pull him up and ward the same Goblin away. He grins and cuts her.
Her name is—is Fulca. I offered her sanctuary. I told her she would be safe.
She falls too. Dying. They’re all dying.
My mouth opens silently. You cannot have them. They are mine. My subjects. My people.
Mine.
I don’t realize that I’ve leapt off the archery tower. I’m standing at the backs of the villagers now, shouting.
“Stand and fight! Don’t retreat! Don’t let them advance a single step!”
They hear me. I can see villager’s heads turning, see them struggling harder. But they are mortal and frail. This is all they can do and spirit is—a Goblin guts a young teenage girl, barely older than a child.
It’s not enough. Now I’m screaming at the Goblins, shouting as they laugh in my face.
“You are not worthy of standing on this land. You did not bleed for it. You have not died for it! The people of this village have lived and died here for generations! This is theirs. And mine!”
I point at the Hob. He sees me now and throws a man aside as he cuts towards me.
“I will burn your people to dust. I will hound them from the face of the earth! I swear to you, for every one of my subjects that falls I will take a hundred of your kind as vengeance! I will not let you take this ground!”
There’s fury in my heart. Something bursting in my mind. I feel something ignite. The Hob is coming. I hear Durene’s scream, Prost yelling.
“Kneel, Goblin.”
This time the Hob’s knees buckle. He pauses and when he looks at me, it’s no longer with a smile. He raises his longsword. I have the axe. I raise it.
Someone shoves me aside. The Hob’s sword descends and cuts the young man who gets in the way. Gamel blinks at me as the longsword opens up his chest. I see bloody ribs, see his open mouth.
He falls. The Hob turns to me and Durene bellows a challenge. She roars, hurling villagers and Goblins aside and the Hob backs up.
I don’t see her collide with the Hob. Gamel’s on the ground. He’s trying to tell me something. I tried? Please…?
I can’t hear. I can sense the light leaving him as I try to grip his hand. Not him. I can’t let him go. I can’t.
I won’t.
“Stand up! Don’t die! I said, stand up! Gamel!”
He tries. But there’s nothing left. He’s given it all to me. All. His life fades and I see it flowing out of him. I reach for it. It’s not enough. I want more. I demand more. He cannot die yet.
I will not allow it.
“Stop bleeding. Stop. Stop.”
It doesn’t work. Something in me speaks. I look into Gamel’s heart. His soul.
“Stop.”
Something—Gamel stares at me. The wound on his chest is gushing blood. It stains the ground. But now the blood stops. Gamel’s body jerks. He stares at me. My voice is an echo. Distant. Loud like tempests, terrible. Alien. It rolls and breaks upon the ears of the living. A command.
“Stand up.”
