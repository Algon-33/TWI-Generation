Big stuffs is happening this month. On the 24th, the Kickstarter for the physical book of The Last Tide, and digital version of both parts will be out! I shouted out a LitRPG Facebook group that reads stuff like The Wandering Inn, so check it out.
More importantly…I am sick. Not ‘lying dying as everything voids itself’ sick, but lightheaded sick. I didn’t believe it at first. Oh, I’m just blowing my nose every other minute. I’m not sick…
Right when I finish my break. I fear it’s affected the chapter. I think I can see it already has; even though I’m rested, everything feels worse.
Why must I be sick? Why? If it affects the next few chapters, I am sorry. But blame…whoever made me sick. Thanks for reading and I hope this was legible. I am going to rest and hopefully recover. Until next time.
