Unlike the adventurer, Kevin had no illegal ice-balls, the ability to levitate a fastball, or fly. But he could throw a curveball. The Gnoll with the bat blinked as the ball curved.
“How did you do that?”
“It’s easy. I played baseball growing up.”
Kevin grinned. Lyonette beamed as she saw more people look up. A Human tried to copy the pitch and nearly beaned a Drake.
“Watch it, you damn Human!”
“Hit the ball, scaleface!”
The two shouted at each other. Lyonette winced—but it was more good-natured. People laughed at the two. Sports had a power. She looked at Kevin as he threw a knuckle-ball to the amusement of all.
“Kevin! You have a talent!”
The young man grinned at Lyonette. He called back.
“But this isn’t my thing. I just like it.”
Lyonette’s face fell. She had no way of knowing it but Kevin was just a decent baseball player by Earth’s standards. Not an athlete who could win a scholarship. She sighed.
One step at a time. At least they were out there, playing.
Most of them. Joseph sat in the inn. He wanted a drink. He had…a problem.
[Drinker]. A class bordering on uselessness. Well—he could put away alcohol, and apparently it was a recognized class. Like [Layabout]. But it was—consuming him.
He couldn’t help it. The young man sat there, until the [Princess] came back to check on him.
“Joseph? Are you not playing baseball?”
“I don’t play baseball.”
He snapped, and saw her brows contract. The young man tried to speak calmly. The Centaur had taken away his drunkenness, but the hangover was here now.
“Sorry. I just—don’t. It’s not my game. I could really use a drink.”
“You shouldn’t have one.”
“I know. It’s just—I started and I can’t stop. I never drank this much back home. But it’s been rough, alright?”
He growled. The [Princess] looked at him.
“You mean, you were almost killed? Like Imani?”
Joseph put his palms over his eyes, wishing the noise would just stop. He should go upstairs, to sleep.
“No. We just landed here. And then Magnolia picked us up. And it was…easy. We had food, money, and she asked us questions at first. We wanted to be adventurers, learn magic, you know? But then she let us become adventurers and we—couldn’t kill monsters. Too much blood. It was like sawing through a corpse.”
He shuddered. He had killed an Eater Goat, with Magnolia’s servants helping keep them safe. It refused to die. He had stabbed it, and stabbed it, until his arms were heavy and it kept coming at him, even after it could only drag its front half as the guts of its lower half remained.
He was no [Warrior]. Magic was…hard. And they wondered why he drank?
“We don’t belong here. I can’t be a hero. I’m not Erin.”
He whispered. The [Princess]’ face was sympathetic. But her voice was stern.
“You can’t just drink, though. Nothing is free.”
“I know. I won’t. I’ll—go to my room. Okay? I’ll be useless somewhere else.”
Joseph hoped he wasn’t lying. He saw Lyonette pause.
Useless? Oh yes, Joseph and the others knew what the staff called them. The ‘Useless Humans’ that Erin had taken in. Of course it stung. But it was true. Joseph hung his head. After a while, he heard someone sit down next to him. Lyonette du Marquin looked at Joseph.
“I don’t think you’re useless. You just haven’t found what you’re good at. That’s not a crime. It’s just—hard.”
“Thanks.”
He raised his head, grateful for the words. But it was true. Joseph felt worthless. He sat there, too tired to go upstairs, as Lyonette hurried off.
