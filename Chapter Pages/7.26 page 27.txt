“No. Be kind to them, Lyonette. Not gentle. They may be poor embers, but everyone has a spark. You just need to find it. Magnolia tends to no flames. But they might surprise you.”
“They do every day.”
Lyonette grumbled, but the words gave her some pause. Maviola always talked about fire. It was her motif. But she was also right, usually.
Everyone has a spark. Thoughtfully, Lyonette looked back into the inn. She heard the others arguing. Then a crash as Joseph tried to put the bottle of gin back and knocked something over. Lyonette’s grabbed at her hair. Maviola hesitated.
“…Sometimes the spark is well-hidden under all the ash. Good luck.”

Fix them. Find their inner fire. Turn crap into gemstones. Who could do that to this lot? This sorry lot that even Montressa and Beza weren’t sure would add much to their reputations if they were brought back to Wistram?
“I am so sorry—”
Joseph backed away as Lyonette stared at the broken bottles of liquor. She saw Ekirra precariously near to a few shards of glass. She lost her temper.
“Erin Solstice! Ryoka Griffin!”
She shouted into the Garden of Sanctuary. Even Lyonette was banned for the moment, but she could make the door appear. Erin, Ryoka, and Teriarch all looked up from their movie-watching. Mrsha was sniffing the air and scenting Goblin and bee.
“What’s up? Oh no. Is it…”
Erin’s face fell into a look of dismay and annoyance. It was mirrored by Ryoka’s as she saw the mess. Lyonette put her hands on her hips. She stared at Ryoka.
“Your guests are causing trouble. Thank you ever so much for sending them, Miss Griffin.”
Ryoka turned red and shuffled her feet.
“I’m sorry. I—there weren’t many places they could go. And I thought…”
“They’ve been here one week. They have no classes worth mentioning. No talents. What are we supposed to do with them?”
“…Keep them here? Alive?”
Erin and Lyonette looked at Ryoka. The City Runner blushed again.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know! It was that or send them to Laken. And knowing him…no, I don’t know him. They’ve had a rough time in their own way, Lyonette, Erin. I just thought of you all. I’m sorry.”
Lyonette had no idea who that was. She sighed, rubbing her forehead.
“What are we supposed to do with them? Ryoka, you found them. How do you manage them?”
The young Asian woman hesitated.
“…Don’t kill them?”
She had no idea. They had gotten on her nerves, as well as Alber and Fierre’s. Let alone Madain—okay, he’d had fun drinking with Joseph and the others. So both Ryoka and Lyonette looked at Erin.
“What?”
The [Innkeeper] looked blank. Lyonette put her hands on her hips.
“Do something. Make them…better.”
“Me? How?”
The two exchanged a look, Ryoka and Lyonette in sync for one moment.
“Erin, you could turn a Creler into a house pet. Can’t you—you know—unearth some goodness in them?”
The [Innkeeper] made a face as she eyed the quarreling six. And Lyonette saw her shuffle her feet.
“I dunno…”
Even Erin was tired of them. In a rare moment of uncharitableness, the young woman scowled. She could do something. But today?
She looked up the hill where Mrsha was pouncing on Numbtongue. Movies, Ryoka—not today. Not now. She looked at Lyonette.
“I don’t wanna. You do it, Lyonette. Please? Just for today.”
“Me? I’m not you, Erin. I can’t—you have to make them better. Please?”
The [Princess] pleaded. But the [Innkeeper] shook her head. She looked at Lyonette, seriously.
“Lyonette. I don’t make people into anything. I just find what’s there. It’s not me. You can do it too. I’ll help. But please—just for today?”
