He shuddered. These were, no offense to him, Ksmvr-level remarks. No—Ksmvr tended to have practical statements and only used these because he thought it was social etiquette to do so.
These were Yvlon-level conversation topics. Pisces just defaulted to the only thing he could think of as the silence drew on.
“So, Rophir took a steam bath?”
Bearig looked up.
“He did.”
“You didn’t…?”
“He washed himself. I asked, but he doesn’t want company.”
“Of course not. That’s very kind of you to…it’s very good of you, what you do, Bearig. Taking care of Rophir.”
“Thank you.”
The [Cook] mumbled. Pisces felt he was being too humble. He twisted.
“Truly. No one else took care of him. I—I wouldn’t know how. I have no siblings, and children—someone needs to help him, and you do important work. If I can help?”
Bearig seemed surprised by the compliments. He turned a bit red.
“I just do what I can. It’s nothing commendable.”
“It is. Rophir is not always easy. I’ve seen him punch you or bite—”
“He’s suffering. It doesn’t hurt. Much.”
Bearig rubbed at his side and Pisces saw some blotches on his skin. Bruises. He shook his head and Bearig scrubbed as if they’d come away.
“—It’s nothing to what he’s been through.”
“Does he talk? I have never heard him talk…”
Bearig talked to Rophir all the time. The [Cook] shook his head.
“Never in words, but he can make it clear what he wants. He is a bit older than he looks. Just a bit. But half-Elves…”
“I’m sure. I…you do it so well.”
“Well.”
Bearig stared past Pisces. He shook his head slowly. The [Necromancer] was trying to be encouraging, but it wasn’t working. Not because Bearig was too modest. Because…
The [Cook] slowly ran a cloth down his arms. He glanced up and met the younger man’s gaze. Seriously. He spoke quietly.
“I am trying, Pisces. But it’s not well. I’d like to treat Rophir like I would my son, but he isn’t. He’s terribly hurt. I’m just taking care of him.”
“That’s all you can ask for, surely.”
Pisces saw Bearig take a deep breath. He let it out shakily.
“Is it? If he were my son—when I think of what’s been done to him, or when he wakes up screaming, but silent—I am helpless, Pisces. I am angry. Emir Riqre did things I would have killed him for. But I watched. We watched.”
“We were [Slaves]. He’s dead.”
Bearig nodded. Pisces felt his skin crawling. Riqre was a name not uttered in the caravan. Igheriz, Hrome—yes. People spat as they mentioned them. Not Riqre. Yet Bearig invoked him, here. In this place, filled with steam and, strangely, privacy.
“I have been thinking, Pisces. How…you heard me talk of Nerrhavia’s Fallen? I employed [Slaves]. I could never afford to buy them, but I rented their help. I did. It gnaws at me. I remember them—and I remember not caring, being annoyed when they made mistakes.”
“You didn’t know what their lives were like.”
Pisces saw the Stitch-man staring blankly ahead. The [Cook] passed a hand over his face.
“Does that excuse it? Perhaps I have seen the worst of Roshal. I hope so—because if there is worse, I hope never to see it. Yet I wonder, Pisces. How many more Riqres are there?”
The [Necromancer] slowly looked up towards the ceiling.
“His evil was one of a kind.”
“Was it?”
Pisces’ mouth was dry despite the steam.
“Igheriz and Hrome called him a monster. Even they did.”
“Even so. He existed. How many more exist?”
The young man felt revulsion building in him at the thought. Bearig glanced at him, then away.
“I shouldn’t say such things. Not now. But I think of them.”
“Why?”
The [Cook] shook his head. His hands trembled as he worked on his chest.
