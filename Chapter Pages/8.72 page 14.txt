“Brass. Hm. Well, that’s good. I couldn’t stand to be gold. Snooty. Is that instinct or just bias in my current stage? So I ask Valeterisa for coordinates. That expedites the matter. I’ll head back as soon as I’m prepared. After this war is over.”
Ryoka’s head turned. She stopped grinning like a loon and focused on Eldavin.
“Huh? What?”
The Archmage looked at Ryoka, calmly, eyes alight with relief and confidence. He knew who he was. That just made the words coming out of his mouth all the more surreal.
“After the war. I cannot abandon the forces here. And these cabal members are far too dangerous, even if I don’t expose them. Now that I know I am a Dragon, I can rely on that knowledge. I wonder if I can access my memory? Either way, I can be more daring in my attacks.”
“Wh—what are you saying? No! Go back to your cave and wake up! Now!”
“I must prepare first, Ryoka—”
“What’s stopping you? You know who you are! Go and become you again!”
She surged upright, but Eldavin caught her hands as she went to shake him. He was effortlessly strong and hesitated. Ryoka drew breath to scream, and the Archmage whispered the final clue in the dread that was returning tenfold.
“I…do not wish to die, Ryoka.”
Die? What was he talking ab—then Ryoka looked at him.
Him. Eldavin. And the Archmage’s eyes were terribly afraid.
“You won’t die. You’re a Dragon.”
“I know. I know Teriarch is. But I am a distinct entity, Ryoka. I’ve heard of it happening. Simulacra that experience distortion. Eldavin has no longer synced with Teriarch. Therefore, when I wake him—Eldavin will vanish. Unless I separate the two via magic. If I wake him now, I vanish. I am sure it is painless. Welcome, perhaps. Perhaps he would remember who I am. But I…”
She saw it. The very core of the Teriarch she knew. Nothing changed, just him—in Eldavin’s body. Fear. Old fear, the greatest survivor, beyond even Rhisveri, who had seen his kind perish.
Teriarch, Eldavin, whispered it in a cracked voice, as if asking her to understand and forgive.
“I do not want to die. Please, understand that.”
Her hands and legs were so weak, Ryoka sagged. Eldavin patted them and let go. He looked at Ryoka.
“I…fear death, Ryoka. I fear it so much I cannot explain it. I must be old.”
“Ancient of days. Dragonlord of Flame.”
He twitched at that.
“I? How old…no. Teriarch. I know that name. He is not just ten thousand years old. He is so old…! Khelt is a child that was never born when he flew the skies. I am him? No wonder he hides. No wonder I—do I know Ailendamus?”
“Go back. Please?”
She begged him like a girl, but Eldavin was shaking his head.
“After the war. It won’t take long, Ryoka. And if I die—well, I can be more daring. There is no risk to me. Or little. Listen—I will return this Paxere if you wish, but I would rather exchange her for Sammial Veltras. It can be done within the hour. Less! I will tell this Rhisveri. Oh damn, I have those gnats bothering me for an interview on House Wellfar.”
There was a faint clamor outside his tent, of Telim arguing with [Mages] and…Drassi’s voice? Eldavin glanced at Ryoka.
“Let’s resolve this first. They won’t get in unless I will it. I swear, Ryoka, Teriarch is not in danger. Neither am I, unless I take a truly dangerous wound and die.”
He was distracting, deflecting. Ryoka mumbled as Eldavin turned.
“What do you mean? A simulacra…”
