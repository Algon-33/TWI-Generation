Slowly, she reached down and picked it up. Lyonette stared at the bloody tip. It was…covered in red. Erin’s blood. She brushed at the tip—then recoiled. She stared. Something had been smeared on the tip.
Something dark. She inhaled once.
“Poison. The bolts are poisoned.”
She showed the coating to him, covered in blood. Numbtongue’s eyes went wide.
Healing potions didn’t work on—
“Guys? I think I’m hurt bad. I could use a p-potion. What’s—”
Erin tried to move. Both snapped out of their horror and looked down. She was reaching with one arm. Trying to reach her belt. Trying to pull out—
She was bleeding and the blood ran onto the grass. Numbtongue looked at Lyonette.
“I didn’t mean—”
He just wanted to scare them. He hadn’t been going to—he looked back at Erin. And suddenly—put his claws over the rushing blood in her chest.
Erin cried out. She flailed, weakly. Numbtongue pressed. Suddenly—he was trying to stop the blood. Stop. The poison. Could they scrape it out of…?
It didn’t work like that. Poison. Lyonette looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] was panting.
“I need a potion. Why isn’t anyone got…?”
The [Princess] spoke numbly.
“It’s poisoned, Erin. We have to get an antidote. Octavia! Get Octavia! Get a [Healer]! Run!”
She shouted at the inn. Silveran, Ishkr—the staff—Numbtongue looked up as he heard voices from inside.
“What’s wrong? Is it safe?”
“Erin’s hurt! Get Octavia!”
Lyonette screamed. And it was a scream, now. Ishkr was standing there—but Silveran turned. Yet a crowd of bodies was suddenly in his way. He fought, but they knocked him back.
“Erin? What? Did those b—”
Menolit stopped just outside the inn. Liska halted, eyes wide. Lyonette looked around. Someone peeked out the doors behind the adults. Her eyes fixed on the body on the ground. Mrsha smelled the blood. But that wasn’t right…
“What are you doing? Potion. Here—”
Menolit stumbled forwards, pulling his emergency vial out. Lyonette knocked it aside.
“Poison.”
The [Veteran] looked at her. More bodies spilled out.
“What’s happening? Wh—”
Palt halted, wand raised. Montressa, Bezale, heard his shout in the hallway. They pushed forwards.
A Hobgoblin stood in the tower. Badarrow stared down, hearing every word. Snapjaw ran out of the inn. He saw her drop to her knees and slide to a stop. She stared at Erin.
“Poison?”
“It hurts.”
The [Innkeeper]’s voice made the hubbub cease. Then—a terrible world of silence followed.
Numbtongue’s ears were rushing. He saw Snapjaw’s eyes widen in horror.
Poison was how you stopped healing potions. You couldn’t save someone—and she’d been struck. In the chest. In the belly. Six bolts. She was bleeding.
“Bandage.”
Snapjaw breathed. She looked around. Numbtongue stared at her. She shoved him.
“Bandages! Run, Goblin! Run!”
He just stayed there. The Redfang felt paralyzed. His claws were covered in blood. He was trying to hold Erin’s life back. The [Eater] rose with a snarl. She turned and charged back into the inn.
And suddenly everyone was in the way. Asking questions. Staring, dumb. Kevin and Joseph skidded to a halt with Rose in front of them.
“No. Erin?”
Rose breathed, turning pale. The others were spreading out. Menolit tried to pour the potion on Erin’s chest. Lyonette—he heard her screaming for Octavia.
“Who did this? The Drakes? Who let this happen? How can she be shot? She’s—the Crazy Human of—”
Someone asked lamely. Numbtongue looked around. Shut up. He tried to scream it at him.
Press! Pyrite was roaring in his head. Press, you worthless fool! 
Numbtongue tried. And Erin cried out.
“Stop! S-stop!”
