She thought that meant they were dead. Mrsha had never thought of them again. She had her tribe, Urksh. Later, she had Lyonette, the inn, Ryoka, Erin, Numbtongue, Bird, Apista. When Stone Spears died, so had every connection to the old Mrsha with brown fur, Mrsha of the Plains Gnolls.
That was that. Never once had she expected…never had she dreamed of finding someone like the strange Gnoll standing here. Yet. Here he was.
Her…
“You’re Mrsha. My—”
Mrell spoke at last, and she didn’t know how long it had been. He didn’t say it, either.
The little girl looked up at the Chieftain sitting in his chair. She stared at him. Then, at last, she moved. She stood up on two legs, and he flinched.
“I—”
Words failed him. Disbelieving, Mrsha took a step forward. She looked around.
Chieftain of the Demas Metal tribe. Chieftain of a tribe she hadn’t known, but a growing one. Come here to become famous. An important Gnoll. Here.
Urksh hadn’t known about him. She was almost certain. This…he was just here. Out of nowhere. No warning. No signs. And now?
She looked at him. Walked over to the chair. Stared up at him. Mrell looked down at her and didn’t smile.
He looked pale, shaky, like he was about to be sick or run. And as Mrsha looked at him, his head jerked to one side. He had stared at her so fiercely before. Now, up close, as he saw the light of comprehension in her face—suddenly Mrell turned into a statue.
“I—”
She waited. Saw a brown eye flick her way, then skitter away and stare right at the tent flaps. Mrsha waited. But he didn’t look at her.
Like Ekirra when he was being naughty. Mrsha reached for her speaking rune. Then she dropped it. She stood there, waiting.
He never moved. He was frozen. Outside, Gnolls were watching the scrying orb where Chaldion spoke. Neither Mrell nor Mrsha moved. It didn’t even matter.
Mrsha waited. She counted ten seconds. Then twenty. Then thirty. Then…she slowly spread her arms out.
It was not a hug. It was a gesture.
Here I am.
She waited.
Mrell didn’t move. Mrsha stomped her foot, and he jumped. He almost glanced at her. But he didn’t.
Now she was angry. The little Gnoll girl grabbed hold of another chair and yanked herself up. Now she stood there, right in front of him.
I’m right here.
She couldn’t say anything. But she knew he could see her. Yet those eyes didn’t swing her way.
“I—didn’t expect—”
Mrsha clapped her paws together as loudly as she could. Mrell started again. She pointed at her chest.
Look at me. Look at me when you speak!
“Your m—Prha is coming. I sh—”
He began to rise. Mrsha lunged forward. He jerked, and she grabbed his clothes. Now she was touching him. He looked down—jerked again, like he was being zapped by a spell. He stared right over her head. She twisted the clothing.
Look down.
And he did not. He tried, but it was like a magnetic force was dragging his head up. His gaze darted around. Mrsha punched his shoulder. And still, Chieftain Mrell never looked at her. He glanced at her face. He tried to say something.
He refused to meet her eyes.
He didn’t want to meet her eyes.
He was afraid to meet her eyes.
He couldn’t meet her eyes.
Which was it? Whichwasitwhichwasit? How dare you? Her mouth opened and closed, but the adult sat there, unable to hear a word. Only a frustrated half sound. A coughing growl. She clawed at her own throat, trying to make the words.
He saw that and almost reached for her. But when she looked up, he flinched away again.
Mrsha had never…not Tkrn in the prison. Not the worst Drake. Not Lism or anyone else.
