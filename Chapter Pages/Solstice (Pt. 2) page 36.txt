Solstice (Pt. 2)

He told the figure as its eyes stared up from the abyss below. Luan was not going to go out on the ocean for a month.
It was submerged in water, with the scraps of whatever lurked beneath. But both were fading. Going away. Luan was turning his scull when he heard the voice, through the water.
“You make one mistake, Luan. You think there were rules to how we met. Rules for us. There are none.”
Luan stared down. He heard the voice again.
“You should have taken my hand.”
The man turned. He cried out, a shout of mortal horror. How had he not seen? Had he been steered into—he tried to move left, or right. Then he r—
The [Fireball] hit the scull dead on. The [Bounty Hunters], who had been firing left and right of the boat to drive it to shore, stopped shouting abruptly.
“L-Luan?”
The leader stared at the burning wreckage. For a body. But it had hit Luan—he turned to the others.
“But it was going to miss! One second he was there and then—”
“A mirage? W-we hit him, boss. We were only supposed to…”
The Lizardfolk stared at the wreckage. They waited for Luan to surface.
He did not. The leader turned.
“Okay. We destroyed the boat! That’s what we’ll say. No truth spells—go, go!”
They turned, paddling desperately for shore. Leaving the wreckage behind.
The others walked across the world. Searching. Searching for…
A friend.

Or something more.
Liscor. The Summer Solstice was fading. The evening wore on, into night. But it would be a long day, still.
Lyonette du Marquin was weeping. She held Mrsha on Erin’s birthday. Selys was with them. Numbtongue huddled around, Bird, everyone squeezed into the private room in Timbor Parthian’s inn.
He had been kind enough to offer it for this day. They were all here.
It never occurred to them to go to the inn. Why would they stay?
They could not.
They had left this morning. So had the Workers. The staff.
The Wandering Inn was empty. Even Apista had left.
The only thing inside was a young woman. In a Garden. Lying frozen on the bier.
But she wasn’t quite there, was she? As the light faded, something opened the front door of the inn at last. It peered inside.
It was a lost thing. It was of lost things.
It was lost. And as such, she—the body called to it.
My, oh my. You forgot something, didn’t you? You lost it.
Your body.
The soul hung in a place between life and death. Separate. And where there were cracks—
Anything could creep in.
Slowly, almost hesitantly, it crept around the inn. Searching the tables, the walls, the kitchen. Devouring hungrily the food. But searching. It was running out of time.
Where?
There. The door creaked as it clawed at it. Trying to find a way in. The cold iron, the solid door—
Began to open. It could have held off armies and monsters. But not it. The figure was impatient. Desperate. They all were.
It had taken so long to find this place. Something had made it difficult. Almost…obscuring things.
What?
The door to the [Garden of Sanctuary] opened further. And there it was.
A little, moldy loaf lying on the grass. Dark as could be. Imperfect.
It would have worked, too. How silly! The door strained against something. But the inexorable force opened it further. Even this incomplete thing would have worked.
But there it was. A shining token. Brighter than the darkness. It had been kept so well. A promise to meet again.
The glittering coin in the desk drawer.
It smiled.
And the door opened further. Just a little more.
You wouldn’t mind it if you never came back, would you?
You would never find your way back. If you lost it.
