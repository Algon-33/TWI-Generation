“I did. I asked, Ceria. And I haven’t had a reason to regret it. The infection’s not from the bones. It’s just—there. And I don’t feel it. It’s fine. I can move my arms.”
To demonstrate, Yvlon lifted the shoulder that had been dislocated. Ceria hissed.
“Don’t do that! You couldn’t use a potion! Those muscles are torn!”
“I can’t feel them. Ceria, I’m fine.”
“You’re as far from fine as Pisces is!”
The half-Elf snapped back. She looked at Yvlon. The woman had folded her arms. Ceria stared at Ksmvr and Pisces.
“You didn’t tell me. Why didn’t you tell me? I’m your Captain, Yvlon! Pisces knew. And Ksmvr? Did everyone know about Yvlon’s arms but me?”
Yvlon avoided Ceria’s gaze. Ksmvr raised one hand helpfully.
“I knew because I have an inadequate sense of personal privacy, Captain Ceria. My finding out was unintentional on Yvlon’s part.”
“But you knew. And I didn’t because, what, you don’t trust me?”
“I didn’t tell you because you’d react exactly like this. Ceria, what do you want me to do?”
Yvlon glared at Ceria, her cheeks flushed. The half-Elf folded her arms.
“Get help. You can’t continue like this. We need to find you a [Healer]—”
“To do what? They couldn’t even fix my arms! Pisces did. I don’t need to sit around while the [Healers] tell me there’s nothing else they can do. I’m an adventurer, Ceria.”
“Not with those arms.”
The woman’s hands tightened on the table.
“It’s what I want to do.”
“And I should just let you?”
“It’s my choice.”
“Not if you’re killing yourself—”
“What else should I do, then?”
Ceria rocked back. Yvlon’s raised voice prompted movement. Erin hurried over.
“Hey, guys. Do you need anything…?”
“No, Erin. Sorry. We’re fine.”
“It’s totally cool. I get it. If you need a drink, or food? Anything you want tonight.”
“I’m not hungry. Not right now.”
“Got it. Just say when…”
Erin looked at Pisces and hesitated. But for once the energetic [Innkeeper] didn’t say anything. The Horns watched her retreat and whisper to Lyonette. Ceria buried her head in her hands.
“How did this happen?”
“The Wistram team had been pursuing Comrade Pisces for a long time. I believe they ambushed us in an effective, if ill-considered move. We were saved by their inappropriate understanding of Liscorian law and their arrogance. And Mrsha’s nose and Miss Erin.”
Ksmvr looked around the table. Ceria nodded dully.
“Montressa. Dead gods. I haven’t seen her for years. And that’s what she turned into? She’s completely different than the Mons I knew. And—what has she been doing? Those spells! That staff and orb! I didn’t get a chance to ask.”
“Not much opportunity to ask with her screaming at you.”
Yvlon reached for a mug of water. She gritted her teeth. Ceria looked up.
“Yeah. Yeah. They’re—those bastards got us. Not a second time. And we’re safe in Liscor.”
“But there’s a bounty on my head. And I am sure Montressa will not rest until I am captured.”
Pisces looked up. He had a ghastly smile on his face. Ceria hesitated.
“We’ll do something about it.”
“What?”
He stared at her. She hesitated.
“We’ll get the bounty overturned. Appeal it! It’s not right. Maybe Watch Captain Zevara can vouch for us?”
Pisces made a disgusted noise and turned away. Ceria looked around desperately. Yvlon was looking at Pisces sympathetically. Ceria had a thought.
“I’ll—I’ll reach out to Falene. She’s a graduate. Maybe she can help.”
“I will speak to someone as well. She will see something is done if anything. But nothing will change the bounty.”
Pisces muttered darkly. Ceria stared at him. She opened her mouth. She wanted to say something.
“About Montressa. She was really—”
