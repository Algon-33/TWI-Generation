A figure stomped through the crowd. Erin saw an old man—or plant. His beard was not, like Typhenous’ neatly combed. And the [Druid] was either younger or kept younger by his class. It was a tangled mess, though.
And his clothing! It was ragged, stained with old soil and dirt. Not filthy, just not like the [Butler]’s immaculate costume. And the Druid gave off a similar odor.
He wasn’t stinky. Just earthen. He walked with the long, curved staff. And Erin saw the staff was still growing. Buds of flowers and leaves grew from it. Also—there was a bit of blood on the bottom.
“Hm. Portal door?”
The [Druid] poked at the edge of the boundary with a staff. He glanced at Magnolia.
“As I said, Nalthaliarstrelous. May I call you Nathal?”
“No. This feels like….Liscor.”
“Again, as I said. Won’t you indulge us? This entire affair falls apart without you.”
The [Druid] crossed his arms. He didn’t seem to care. He glanced at Erin.
“Who’re you?”
“Hi, I’m Erin.”
That was all Erin could think to say. She was on the wrong-foot here. And more—she was being overpowered.
Inside her inn. But the three [Ladies] were quite literally forcing Erin backwards. Erin could feel it—especially Wuvren. She felt compelled not to speak, or interrupt the scene. She was fighting, but it was three versus one.
“[Innkeeper]. Hm.”
The [Druid] glanced about. Then his eyes brightened.
“A garden. Here?”
He walked through the doorway. He passed by Erin and looked around. His eyes found the Garden of Sanctuary.
“Ah.”
He hurried into it. Erin gaped. He’d just gone into her Garden! Magnolia tsked.
“Oh dear. I should have predicted—Ressa, fetch him.”
The [Maid] hurried after Nalthaliarstrelous. She ran smack into the doorway. The open air blocked Ressa as she pushed against it.
Magnolia snickered. She covered her mouth as Ressa looked back at her. Then both of them looked at Erin.
“Miss Solstice? If you’d allow Ressa a moment? We really do have a schedule to keep.”
“Why are you here?”
Erin was trembling. She saw Ceria gaping. Mouthing Magnolia’s name. But everyone was stuck. Magnolia sighed.
“It would be hard to explain. Oh well. We have ways. Excuse me? Little Gnoll? Mrsha?”
She bent down. Mrsha stared at Magnolia as the woman smiled at her.
“Would you mind fetching Nalthaliarstrelous? Please?”
Erin heard the [Charm] in the voice. She glowered. Mrsha blinked a few times. She walked towards the door—and someone scooped her up.
“I’ll do it. Excuse me, Erin. Lady Reinhart.”
Lyonette patted Mrsha on the head. She turned her head. Magnolia Reinhart met Lyonette’s eyes. The [Princess] curtsied.
“Oh? And you are?”
Magnolia Reinhart touched the tip of her hat. She regarded Lyonette levelly. The [Princess] was breathing hard, but she was moving. She bowed deeply.
“I am the [Barmaid] in charge of The Wandering Inn. May I serve you [Ladies]?”
“Hm. I believe so. Our [Druid] has invaded the garden. I would quite like him back.”
“Of course, Lady Reinhart.”
The [Princess] turned. Magnolia raised a finger.
“Ah—but before you do. Might I ask, Miss…[Barmaid]?”
Lyonette froze. Her shoulders hunched. And she turned with a friendly smile on her face.
“Yes, Lady Reinhart?”
The [Lady] regarded her as Ressa stepped back.
“Do you enjoy it, working here? I ask just out of curiosity.”
The young woman hesitated. Then she curtsied.
“Yes, milady. Quite a lot.”
Magnolia smiled. And she dipped her hat in a gracious nod.
“All well and good, then. If you could fetch Nalthaliarstrelous? And do use his name. He’s peculiar about that.”
