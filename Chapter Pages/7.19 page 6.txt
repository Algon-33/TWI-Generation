Still—Xrn got her way. The Antinium would come to Erin’s inn. Each night, in fact. They had a budget. And it was large enough to make Lyonette smile all day—and that was aside from the news that Pawn and at least a dozen Antinium would have rooms in Erin’s inn as the second and third floors were constructed.
Xrn had paid in advance. And they might double or even go three to a room, but they’d be here. Heck—she was doing great things.
And terrible. And it wasn’t like her presence didn’t affect Erin. It did—it made Erin worried. And thoughtful. Just not predisposed to support Xrn wholly.
So Erin amended her plans.
“I’m not gonna make alcohol. Too much work. I’ll just roll into phase two of my plan. It’s all related. I’m gonna borrow the kitchen, okay, Lyonette? I’m making stuff for Palt.”
The [Princess] could never follow Erin. She eyed the young woman.
“How is alcohol and the kitchen related for…oh.”
Her eyes widened. Erin blinked.
“Oh, sorry. Not Palt. Pelt! Those names are so similar, it cracks me up each time.”
She grinned. Then she pointed.
“Door! Kitchen!”
Erin walked into the kitchen. Lyonette followed her, sighing. She walked into the inn and began serving clients.
The Wistram [Mages] came downstairs. Palt, as always, had trouble navigating the stairwell.
“Move it, Palt! I’m hungry!”
Montressa complained. Beza reached out and Palt nearly bit at her.
“Push me and I’ll kick you, Bezale! I’m hurrying!”
“What’s for breakfast?”
“Eggs benedict! Get them while it’s hot! Can I borrow the newspaper when you’re done, Numbtongue? I want to share it with my friends. Isn’t it amazing?”
“Mhm.”
The Wistram [Mages] exchanged a knowing glance about the newspaper. But Palt was heading over to a table.
“I think we’ll be investigating this um, Golden Triangle thing. We’ve got orders from the top, Palt. You?”
“I’m off my leash. The Golden Triangle?”
“Yup. In Pallass. Apparently Naili wants us on it now. Something to do with, you know? The guests? Sounds like trouble, but what do I know?”
Montressa rolled her eyes as she took her plate. Beza was nodding.
“We will look into it. Quickly. Apparently, some [Lords] have joined the movement. And nations. Thousands of gold are being turned into profits.”
“I did hear about it. It sounds lucrative. Only…”
Palt’s eyes narrowed. He glanced at the kitchen and Montressa sighed.
“You do your thing. We’ll do ours.”
“Maybe I’ll just see if Erin wants to chat. Or—if she needs help. Is she cooking, Lyonette?”
“Something, Palt. If you want to help, be my guest. And if you could make some more of your saffron rice tonight? It always sells!”
Lyonette smiled gratefully at the Centaur. He trotted into the kitchen.
A few seconds later he trotted out. Beza and Montressa looked up as he went back to his plate.
“What’s wrong, Palt? Not gonna help Erin out?”
Montressa gave the Centaur a suspicious look. The [Illusionist] pulled out a smokeless cigar—he was running out—and shuddered.
“Not this time. I would, but…I can’t help with construction or tasting. Not my field.”
“What?”
Beza looked incredulous. But Palt just nodded to the kitchen. A young woman edged out. She was holding something. She lifted it and the Minotauress’ jaw dropped.
“Can I get anyone to help me taste test this?”
Numbtongue, Mrsha, and Beza all stared at what Erin was holding. Mrsha fainted onto the ground. Numbtongue slowly raised a hand. Beza looked at Montressa and grinned.
“I knew I liked this inn. I’ll help! Is it free?”
“Erin, what is that?”
