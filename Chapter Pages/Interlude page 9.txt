Interlude

If it is, I walk through it. My cane taps the mud. Every few feet I run into something. A body. Sometimes my cane taps on armor, other times flesh. If I were anywhere else I would be confused, unsettled by the strange forms lying around me. But I know what has passed here. And I am sick.
Everything is so…quiet. I can hear practically nothing. Nothing but my heartbeat. There are distant sounds. Galloping hooves, sometimes voices. The buzzing of flies. But around me nothing but silence. The dead lie in droves. Invisible to the blind man.
But I can feel them. Soft shapes, hard metal. They’re lying everywhere. I can’t imagine how many. I know there was a battle here, but I can see none of it. I wish my senses as an emperor extended to this place. I wish I could know the extent of my failure. My unforgivable…
Dead. Just like that. And the smell. I gag, but my nose has already gotten somewhat accustomed to the smell. It will only grow worse as time passes. And, I’m told, the dead will begin rising. I shouldn’t be here. But I can’t help it. I have to know. I have to know.
“Emperor. Your majesty!”
A voice calls out to me. Gamel. He’s been following me. I ignore him. I nearly trip over an arm. Bent down to touch clammy flesh. The body’s warming. I shudder.
“What have I done?”
“Sire, please—”
A hand reaches for me. I knock it away. Walk forwards. I’m deaf to the voice that implores me to move back, to rest. I’ve been walking through the night and into the day. Searching for something to make sense of it all.
How could I? I didn’t realize this would be the result. Could I have done anything differently? There must be consequences for this. There must—I thought they were monsters.
“Laken!”
Gamel grabs me. I start.
“Gamel?”
His voice is hoarse.
“Laken—sire. You must rest. Let me take you away. Lord Yitton and Lord Gralton—”
“Let them wait. Gamel, I have to be here. I have to witness this. How many are there around me?”
I cannot see them. But I know they are there. Gamel hesitates.
“A—score, sire. Many bodies. Please—”
“Thousands? Tens of thousands?”
“I cannot count them all. Your majesty—”
I’m shaking. I push Gamel back and stumble forwards. Where am I? I don’t know. I move forwards, tapping with my stick. Then the tip of it strikes something and something makes a sound. I freeze and Gamel draws in his breath.
“Emperor! Stand back! One of them is alive!”
He draws his sword. I hear it unsheathed, hear the laugh from below. I hold out a trembling hand.
“Gamel, hold.”
“­Sire!”
“Hold. This Goblin. Is it hurt? Is it trying to attack me?”
There’s a pause. Gamel gulps.
“It—should be dead, sire. Somehow, it’s breathing. And it’s looking at you.”
“I see. You there. I apologize, but I can’t see you. I’m quite blind, you see.”
I sense something in front of me. Cautiously I tap forwards and hear a faint sound. Breathing. And—a voice? My heart skips a beat.
“Can you talk?”
“Your m—”
“Back up, Gamel.”
I bend my head to listen. A low voice. Weak. But the words are perfectly understandable. If I were not told—no, if I forget all of what’s passed—I could believe I was listening to another Human being lying on the ground.
Maybe this is just a strange dream. Or a trick. But I cannot help but believe. I listen, as the Goblin speaks. And I shake my head.
“I’m sorry.”
I hear a faint laugh. Scorn. The Goblin has every right to it. What good are my words? He—it is a he—is dying. I kneel down in the muck. I hear a sound from Gamel, but I ignore it.
