“I see. Autonomous Workers. Not Individuals. And you are all Archers?”
“Yes, Individual Pawn. I am Archer B25.”
“I am Archer B11.”
“I am Archer B3.”
“I am Archer B8.”
“I am…”
Pawn’s head turned to each Worker as they began to introduce themselves. They did it eagerly, never mind that even Mrsha would have caught onto the pattern after the eighth Worker. But Pawn listened to all twenty five, nodding as each spoke their name. Because it mattered to them.
It was their name. And suddenly, Pawn had so many questions.
“You are all on break?”
“Yes, Individual Pawn. We are relieved from duty.”
“I see. Then will you sit with me? Some of the fluff places are open.”
In fact, they all were. The Soldiers let the Workers sit with Pawn. The Workers carefully touched at the blankets and pillows, afraid to sit too heavily. Pawn sat on the ground, refusing the pillows.
“You’re [Archers]. And you…fight.”
“Yes, Individual Pawn. Revalantor Klbkch assigned us to an archery unit. We were the second one formed. We support the Soldiers. It is an experimental role. We are experimental.”
“No. You’re not.”
The Workers started. Pawn held up a hand.
“I’m sorry. I meant…you’re not experimental. You’re all very—vital. You help fight, don’t you? That is a function the Hive needs. You use bows. That’s brave.”
They stared at him, hungrily. And Pawn didn’t know why, until he remembered what it was like being them. Hungry for…
“Was it hard?”
“We fulfill our roles. We try not to fail. Sometimes we do. Our arrows miss.”
“Arrows miss. But you shoot at monsters coming straight at you. You do a good job. Have—have you ever been above?”
“Once.”
The whisper came from all of them. And they spoke in unison as much as apart. Pawn looked at them.
“Only once?”
“We were on a patrol. We saw the sky. We fought Shield Spiders. We did not eat food. The inn was closed. But we saw a dog. It barked at us.”
The Workers all nodded together. That was important. Pawn remembered being a [Builder] above. Yes, it was special if you saw anything other than the building you were ordered to construct, deconstruct, or repair. He nodded solemnly.
“That is very special.”
And inside, he felt a knife cutting his organs to pieces. Look at these Workers. They stared at Pawn as if they were staring at the Queen herself. And they had only been above once. The same for many Soldiers. Purple Smiles took patrols above of course, but—
“Let’s go above.”
The word came out of Pawn. It stunned the Workers. They hugged the pillows and blankets.
“Now?”
“Are we allowed? Is it permitted?”
“We have gone above once, though.”
“Some Workers have not. Archer Group F has not.”
“No? Then they should come too. Let’s get them. Where are they?”
Pawn stood up. He felt terrible, but in a different way all of a sudden. Look at these Workers! What was he doing? The Workers stood with him.
“Archer Group F is on the frontlines. Individual Anand has their group.”
“Let’s find them. You—come with me. Purple Smiles! I’m going to lead a patrol to the surface. That’s fine. I think.”
Pawn waved at Purple Smiles. The [Sergeant] smiled widely with his mandibles. Soldiers turned. Pawn pointed at a group waiting for their turn on the sparring circles.
“Are you free? Come with me. We’ll go to the surface.”
