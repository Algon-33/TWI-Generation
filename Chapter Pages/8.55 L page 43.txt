“…Besides. It will do you little good. So consider this meeting a moment of hope, nothing more. Hope…but my dear. I know. You know. It will not be more than that.”
“Why not? You could take me to him—her?”
For some reason, him was Rafaema’s instinct. Magnolia smiled at Rafaema as Ressa shifted, eyes widening. Magnolia saw it, but shook her head at both of them.
“My dear Rafaema. I cannot imagine a world in which that does not include your…guardians. Your minders. And believe me, that is unacceptable.”
Makhir. Rafaema heard a bang from the door and a loud voice followed by muffled conversation. He’d already followed her? Well, she had flown into the window—Ressa stood up.
“I’ll talk to them. Reynold—let him see her.”
A fighting Gnoll at the gates—Makhir. He saw Rafaema, then was pulled back.
“Wall Lady!”
“I’m fine, Makhir! Leave me be!”
She shouted back, furious. Then turned to Magnolia.
“You see.”
“Who is it? Are they—are they young? Did they send you here to meet me? Could I send a message? How is it possible? Why doesn’t Manus know?”
Magnolia Reinhart’s face looked more and more pained as Rafaema begged for answers. She folded her hands in her lap.
“Not young. Wall Lady, truly. The more you know, the more painful it will be. Leave it be. Our meeting was not by design, I assure you. As for how I know? It is completely my news sources, which, I must say, have elements even Manus cannot safeguard against. He…may know. I suspect he does. But you will not meet with him, I think.”
“Why?”
Magnolia searched for some tea. But there was none, so she reached for the wine bottle, and sighed as she put it back.
“…Because he has no interest in you.”
“Not me? We are the last ones in the world! Unless—there are more?”
Magnolia Reinhart’s face wasn’t blank, it was just nothing. No clue to Rafaema. The Lightning Dragon focused.
“Why not? I have so many questions. We could be—you know about…?”
Cire? She was afraid she was giving something away, but Magnolia just sighed.
“My dear. The reason he does not care—no, let me put it another way. He may genuinely not know. I suspected he did, but sometimes I overestimate his intelligence. Either way—if he did not seek you out, even if he did not know, I do not think he would meet with you. And, to be clear, he would find you. You could never find him.”
“Why wouldn’t he?”
Magnolia gave her a long look. A sad look. She glanced towards the door.
“Rafaema of Manus. What would you have to offer him? Nothing. Nothing but youth and, I think, grief. What could you do but entangle him in petty affairs? He may wish to meet one of his kin. That is true. That has always been true. But one of his kin. Not a child surrounded by minders. He has met too many of you, I think. Too many of us. Too many children.”
Rafaema sat there, vibrating. She felt something rising in her chest—she was hyperventilating and Magnolia saw it. The [Lady] reached out.
“Control your breathing. Calm. Calm yourself, Rafaema.”
Her aura was like an added link of chain in a wall. Rafaema stabilized. Then she cried out.
“I don’t know what is happening. I can’t control myself!”
“You are growing up. That’s all. It is never pleasant, Humans, Drakes, or otherwise. Find someone with aura training. Or go sit cross-legged and meditate for a year. [Monks] and whatnot.”
Magnolia sat back, sighing. Rafaema saw Makhir arguing his way forwards. She leaned towards Magnolia, desperately.
“Tell me. Tell me and…I’ll seek him out.”
“No.”
Magnolia Reinhart decided to pour herself a cup of wine. Rafaema’s fists clenched.
“Tell me! Or it will be a matter for Manus!”
