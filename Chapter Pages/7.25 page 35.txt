“This is your fault! They had bets! Bets! It wasn’t supposed to be like this! You were supposed to go and we were safe! You took your door!”
The man was babbling. Erin saw the people around her restraining the [Mayor]. She didn’t know what to say.
“He’s distraught. Pay him no mind. This wasn’t your fault.”
A voice spoke wearily from the side. Erin turned and jumped.
“Fals!”
She threw her arms around him. The City Runner staggered. He looked relieved to see Erin and sagged in her arms.
“Erin Solstice. You came.”
“Of course. As soon as I heard. Are you okay? Where’s Ryoka?”
“She left. I’m sorry. She was hurt.”
“Oh…”
Erin had known. She closed her eyes. Why had Ryoka been here? But there was no time to ask questions. With the help arriving, Fals looked ready to collapse. Erin looked at him.
“You need to rest. Come on. Back to the inn.”
“I can still move.”
“No. We have it. You did so well, Fals. Rest.”
The City Runner’s energy went out of him at Erin’s words. He dropped and Erin had to get someone else to help her half-carry Fals. Someone else led Cetris away.
This was her night. Working in Celum. It was insane. Erin couldn’t believe this burned-out city was the same place she’d been fighting with.

Hours later, closer to midnight, The Wandering Inn was bustling. The door kept opening and closing and people filled the hallways. Drassi admitted a line of people from Esthelm, ready to help, and pointed.
“Wait in the hallways. Or common room. We’re letting through people from Celum. Make room, please! Left side!”
The [Builders] nodded, moving left while the right-hand traffic of frightened Humans, some with only the burned clothing on their backs, sat, waiting to be let into Esthelm or Liscor. Many were crying, or just too numb for words.
It was a familiar look. As they sat there, a little figure crept past them. Mrsha carefully poked a woman holding her sons. They jumped in terror, looked at her.
Solemnly, Mrsha offered them a cup of goat’s milk. She was passing out refreshments.
“Oh…for us? Thank you.”
The little Gnoll nodded. She looked at the two boys and they stared at the Gnoll. Mrsha carefully handed them two more mugs off her little tray and yawned.
“Is that you, Mrsha? Thank you for helping. But you must rest. Time for bed.”
A figure appeared behind Mrsha. The Humans froze, slopping the milk out of their mugs. Pawn saw the little Gnoll shake her head, blearily going back for more drinks.
“Be at peace. I am Pawn. I will help heal anyone who needs it. I have sustenance. Potions. Do not be alarmed. What is your name?”
The frightened mother hesitated. Something about the Antinium was…soothing. Perhaps it was the gently smoking censer he held, or his…nature. She untensed.
“Lila. I—we’re fine, sir.”
The Antinium opened his mandibles and raised them. The Humans flinched, but his voice was soft. He knelt, looking at them.
“You are not. But you will be safe.”
Something about his voice made them feel he was genuine. The family nodded slowly. The [Priest] walked down the line of Humans, introducing himself.
This was disaster. Tragedy. The door flickered to Liscor and Drassi waved at the others.
“Through here! We have beds—Pawn, please take them.”
“Yes, Drassi. Everyone, follow me. You will be safe. There is room for all.”
The [Priest] led the frightened people away. Drassi leaned on the door.
“Celum, next.”
She opened the door, tired. She’d been doing this for hours. But it wasn’t even hard work. No one could rest with the destruction.
