She spoke, and this is what Belavierr said in The Wandering Inn, the only words that mattered. The only words that fit.
“[Immortal Moment].”
The world beyond stopped. Numbtongue stopped, mid-cut. Niers, Ulvama…Mrsha saw the entire world turn dark. Freeze. And then there she was. Belavierr stood in the doorway, walking past the Goblin. With all the time in the world she stood at the open doorway. Then she smiled down at Mrsha.
Awkwardly.
“Hello, little girl. Won’t you let me in?”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: This is going to be a cliffhanger because I owe the revised chapter next time! Diana Gill will be editing it and showing her process and it will be intense! As intense as this chapter?
…Yes. Maybe. Possibly! It’s all coming together. So watch out! Thanks for reading and remember—the chapter will be delayed for Public readers until revised, whereas Patrons can read the original and revised edits! So…it might be an update or two of delays, but that’s for quality!
I improved markedly with the last revision process. Rebecca Brewer’s help was useful and I did notice writing tics—as well as the need to add more description and tighten up areas of my writing. I wonder what I’ll learn this time? Well, I don’t always get a chance to inject quality as I write fast, but that’s why we’re here. Thanks for reading and see you next time!
And don’t worry. The moment will keep. For as long as it needs to…
