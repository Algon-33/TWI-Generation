“Yes. I still believe. I still work for that day, little Bird. The day we return and bring justice and vengeance to Rhir. So does Klbkch. But I have grown. I am…different now. Very different from the Queen I once was. I eat this—food. I cannot help it. I cannot stop. It hurts.”
She gestured towards Garry’s kitchen. And the [Cook] looked up at her, suddenly alarmed. Bird glanced at the kitchen.
“Does it hurt very muchly? Eating?”
“No. Living. Always, Bird. We destroyed our bodies birthing the first thousands of Antinium. And we were not meant for it; we had to modify ourselves during those first days in Izril. Experiment—some of us bore more of the cost than others. Silent Queen, the Flying Queen, and I were…lucky. We were youngest, our bodies frail, so we were not chosen for the first tests. The older Queens accepted it. Eight died. Of the first that survived were the Twisted Queen. The Armored Queen. The Grand Queen at the time was less affected. But we all suffer.”
“It sounds bad. I do not like it. Do you want a healing potion?”
Bird’s voice quivered. The Free Queen made a sound like a laugh.
“It is. And no healing potion can change how our bodies have altered, Bird. But we persevere. And I—I have found what I need. I was exiled from the other Hives. Cast out, because I tried to create an Individual. Or one of the True Antinium. One who could think as we originally did. I thought it was an impossible task at times. But Klbkchhezeim believed. And now. Now I have found a True Antinium.”
“Where?”
Bird looked around excitedly. The Free Queen made the same sound. Garry looked up.
“She means you, Bird.”
“Me?”
“Yes.”
The Free Queen reached for Bird’s head. And she stopped. She looked at Bird and tried. Oh, she tried. But it was hard. Harder than words. It shouldn’t have been. Why did it have to be him?
“If it were my mentor, she could have found out what makes you different. But I am not her. I have none of her Skill. And even if I took you apart, I might not find out what it makes the True Antinium. But even a fragment of a chance is enough. If I could just kill you without regret. If you did not sing, little Bird. How easy it would be.”
And he looked at her. And the Free Queen saw he understood. Bird looked at her feelers. At her limbs. At her. And he spoke clearly.
“But I do not want to die.”
“I know.”
The Free Queen held him to her face. Her mandibles opened and closed.
“And yet, you can hear me. Barely. But it is enough. What makes you so, Bird? I must know. The True Antinium are what made us strong. If I was sure it would be so easy. And if I knew it would matter…to strike a blow at our enemy, I would kill you, dear Bird. I would tear myself apart bit by bit if it would help.”
“But I do not want to die.”
He looked at her. The Free Queen hesitated. She reached for him and Bird rocked. But the Free Queen did not touch him. Slowly, gently, she placed him on the ground. Garry ran to Bird and hugged him. Bird stared up. The Free Queen sat. And she felt old and tired. And it hurt.
“What should I do? We are waning, Bird. Waning. Even Klbkchhezeim, my Slayer, is faded.”
“Really? Klbkch is very scary. He has swords.”
This time the Free Queen did laugh. She thought of Klbkchhezeim and laughed, and laughed, a despairing, echoing sound.
