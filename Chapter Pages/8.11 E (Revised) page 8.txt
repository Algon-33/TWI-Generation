Erin pulled away. She shook her head, trying to explain. Trying to tell her…she looked around and spoke.
“I’m sorry. Mom? Mom, I’m really sorry. I think I’m dreaming. I think—I died. And I’m just pretending I’m back home.”
Shauna Solstice blinked. Then her face turned pale.
“Erin. Do you remember…?”
The young woman slowly nodded. She was uncertain, but the feeling grew in her chest. She clenched her hand, and felt something was wrong. She didn’t remember. And yet? She looked up at her mother.
“This sounds crazy, Mom. I don’t…remember where I went, when I vanished. I know why I came back, though. I died. I can’t remember a single thing—but I remember my friends. I had friends. I don’t know their faces. But I know they were there. I remember the people who died for me. It feels like a dream, right now…so far away, so—silly.”
The certainty was growing in her. Like the tears, something was welling behind an invisible dam. She strained for the memories. What had it been? What had she lost?
Pain lanced through her chest. Shauna reached out.
“Erin, let me—let me call your father. And the agent…”
She fumbled for her phone. Her daughter was still speaking. Her eyes searched the distance, looking past the walls.
“It was somewhere else. Another…another world. And it was good and bad. And I died. I remember.”
She touched her chest. That was what was wrong. Shauna made a sound. Erin looked up and saw her mother was crying.
“Erin, don’t strain yourself. This could be—just breathe. Don’t—don’t say you’re dead.”
Guilt flashed across Erin. Yet still, she shook her head.
“I’m sorry. I can’t remember entirely. Something’s…I can’t remember it all. But. I could never forget. They died for me. I remember how they laughed and how they left.”
She stood up, slowly. Now, her head moved. Searching. Her room felt so empty. All the mundane things, all the things that had been so familiar, a worn plushy, warm blankets, the chess games—it felt hollow. She shook her head.
“I’ve changed. I don’t fit in here. I can’t sit in my old bed and not feel as though something’s wrong.”
She walked past her mother. Shauna tried to block her.
“Your father’s on the way. Erin, stop. What are you doing?”
Erin’s mother stopped as the young woman looked at her. Because there was something different in Erin’s eyes now. Certainty. She walked into the hallway of her house. Looking for…again, Erin shook her head. Trying to throw something off her. It was closing in, like fog, eating away what she knew had happened. Yet, it couldn’t erase it all. She remembered.
“I held them as they died. I watched them. I wish each and every one of them had survived. I would do anything to change what happened. But deny it? Forget? Forget? How could I be so petty? So small?”
She turned her head. Shauna pushed into the hallway.
“Erin!”
The bathroom door. It was no wardrobe and the bathroom light was significantly less cool than a light post. Erin still walked towards it. Shauna pulled at her.
“Erin. Erin, sit down. You’re having an episode. Erin?”
“I killed people. I killed monsters and I met heroes. I served drinks to adventurers and friends. I was there. I—I have to go back.”
Erin struggled. She tried to explain, pulling away from her mother and feeling horrible. Yet she had to.
“I have to! Mom! Let me go. Let me—”
Something was telling her to go. None of this—was any of it real? Erin longed to explain it. But she felt it, more strongly than anything. She struggled free.
“Erin!”
