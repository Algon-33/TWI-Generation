Mating Rituals Pt.2

“No. I don’t think he’s even scored a single point. And I don’t know if I have, either.”
That was all he said. And after a while, the Antinium stood up. Sex might be seen, or partaken in. Erin let them go with Relc. But the Senior Guardsman had a sudden thought as he went with the Antinium. He turned to Beilmark. And he was suddenly grave.
“Beil. Um…Antinium. Guys. You know, about your missing…do you…do you think that it’s possible—I mean, Klbkch looks different. And he’s Klb. But I’ve never heard—I mean, I thought it was him and the Queen or something. But does he not have…”
He gestured silently. Beilmark’s ears perked up. Belgrade and the others looked at each other.
“I cannot imagine why, Senior Guardsman Relc. He inhabited a Worker body before his new one. And I understand genitalia are a weak point.”
Relc stared. Then he leaned against the doorway.
“Oh no. No wonder he’s so angry—Beilmark. You take them. I’ve gotta—”
“Done.”
The Guardswoman was nodding. The Antinium stared at each other.
“Is it really that bad a thing?”
The female Gnoll shrugged as Anand looked at her.
“Males think so.”

Sex. Or lack thereof. How it dominated things, when you let it. But there were bypasses. Workarounds. Like the vial Xif was showing Octavia and Saliss.
[Alchemists] didn’t just do it explosively, they didn’t do it at all. Because they didn’t need to. With this. Octavia eyed the vial. It was, of course, shimmering a bit. But she’d seen a number of odd ingredients going into it.
“I’ve seen aphrodisiacs. But um…Master Xif, Master Saliss. What is this?”
The two [Alchemists] looked at each other. Saliss tapped the vial.
“This is a potion you can drink that makes you orgasm. It’s outlawed in Pallass, mainly because of the impropriety.”
“Org—you mean, it helps in bed?”
Saliss rolled his eyes and Xif grinned.
“No. I mean, you drink this? You have a good time. Not the same as aphrodisiac, or a love potion. Different effects. Some are more mental, other long-lasting without being as…dramatic. See, I’m not good at this. Which is why we’re here. Hey, Xif.”
“Saliss. I whipped up one dose since I heard you’d be bringing Miss Cotton here. Miss Cotton.”
“Master Xif.”
The two nodded stiffly at each other. Saliss just grinned.
“Don’t worry, Octavia. This isn’t an imposition. Xif is delighted to have you here.”
“Yes, using my ingredients and shop.”
“We’re paying you back for it. And you get your share.”
Saliss rubbed his claws together. Octavia looked around.
“I’m sorry, but why does this benefit Master Xif? Also, why is this potion here if it’s banned in Pallass?”
The Gnoll coughed. And Saliss chuckled.
“We’re teaching you the recipe. So we…have to make some. And it occurred to us that Liscor doesn’t ban these potions. Or…other cities in the north.”
The Stitch-Woman’s eyes went round.
“Oh! Then—there’s a new market? But this potion, will it sell?”
She eyed the potion dubiously. Something that bypassed all the pleasure of sex? How was that better than the real thing? But Saliss was just nodding.
“It will sell. The reason the Walled Cities banned them was because too many ingredients went towards making them. A huge market and we actually had a shortage of other potions.”
“Why? Because it was addictive?”
“Not alchemically. But—here. Try some if you want. As much as you care to.”
He offered Octavia the vial. She hesitated. It was common to try a potion’s effects so you knew what it did. She eyed Saliss, and then downed the vial in one.
Octavia paused. She knew better than to say ‘nothing happened’. She just had to wait for…
