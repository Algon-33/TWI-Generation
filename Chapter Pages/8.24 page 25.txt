“High-level targets. Send in the Order of the Thirsting Veil!”
Each army had its champions who could break formations. You had to deal with them, but they were trying to give their fellows an opening.
Not on his watch. General Vexil snapped.
“[No Retreat! No Surrender! Hold Your Ground!]”
The buckling pikes froze. Instantly, they swung their weapons up, presenting perfect rows of teeth, despite the small holes in them. They’d hold—even if the [Knights] rampaged all the way through them from behind.
Time returned to normal. Vexil whirled and pointed at Ser Zulv and the [Knights] who’d come with him.
“Mark that group of [Knights]. I want them dead.”
“That’s Wildfire’s Wrath. A company of elite [Summer Knights].”
“Run them into our veterans!”
Vexil turned back. The first rank might take horrendous casualties, but the pikes were aimed at the [Knights] about to charge into the valley before them. They weren’t all Level 40+! He waited…and saw the ground flicker. General Vexil’s eyes went wide.

Ailendamus had dug a trench to force the [Knights] to climb up into the stabbing pikes. A wonderful tactic using nothing but geography to punish enemy forces. A classic that had killed entire armies on Earth; taking the high ground was a nightmare.
Tyrion Veltras had just looked at Ryoka when she pointed out the nightmare of fighting like that. His response had been ‘so what’?
It was a giant hole in the ground. This? This was a magical world.

“Now! Up!”
The first scrolls were unrolled. The Summer Knights charged into the trench. No—over the trench. Rabbiteater stared down at the glowing ‘ground’. He followed the [Knight] in front of him up—over the light bridge.
The [Pikemen] looked up as the first Summer Knights climbed the temporary bridges and charged down onto them. Rabbiteater saw the first terrified Humans trying to swing their pikes up—then he thrust his lance forwards.
“Forwards!”
Talia and Chise were right behind them. They thrust their lances forwards, wrenching them loose. The Summer Knights crashed forwards.

“Hey. They stole our tactics.”
One of Embria’s [Soldiers] pointed at the [Light Bridge] spell. The Drake rolled her eyes.
“We didn’t invent it, you idiots. Keep watching.”

“They’ve passed the first rank, General! Orders?”
“Put up the [Stone Walls]! Now!”
[Mages] began erecting walls of stone, raising them in front of the charging [Knights]. Vexil watched, stomach churning.
This was going south—the Season of Summer was rampaging forwards. The second rank of pikes was advancing into them, but the Summer’s Champion couldn’t be stopped! He was clearing a path for the [Knights] around him to continue their charge unimpeded.
“Send the Order of the Thirsting Veil forwards!”
The [Knights] on standby and not fighting the Spring Knights surged forwards to halt the charge of the Summer’s Champion. General Vexil pointed.
“[Formation: Anchors of Lead]!”

The Summer’s Champion grunted as he hit a [Soldier] and felt the weight of the impact push him back slightly. Suddenly, trying to push the [Soldiers] was difficult. Each one seemed to weigh three times as much!
“Enemy [Knights] incoming!”
Ser Zulv called. Greysten bared his teeth.
“With me, Zulv, Wildfire! Let’s crush them! Summer fades! [Call to Single Combat]! Come, Ailendamus’ champion!”
