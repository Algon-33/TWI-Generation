I don’t know if it was not cooked enough or sat out too long. It tasted fine, but my stomach started hurting as I was writing, live, at the end of my day. It got worse and worse, but I could not tell if it was back pain or stomach pain because they sometimes run together.
And I couldn’t sit up straight. Then I had to lie down in the middle of writing and I couldn’t even get up. I was fairly sure it was food poisoning and am now, but for three hours, the pain really sucked. As in, for the first time I was wondering if I was going to call an ambulance if I had to endure it much longer.
I’ve never had pain from food poisoning that intense before, but after three hours it went away and I could handle moving and doing things…now it’s fine, as I type this. Hurts, but it wasn’t ‘I cannot move’ pain.
That’s my story. It’s hour 4 of food poisoning and I have chills despite it being the same temperature as always. So whatever this chapter was, I’m sure it was shorter. Nasty stuff. I have one more of those frozen pizzas left, but if I eat it, it’ll be charred.
The point is: I hate getting sick. This is pirateaba’s mini-story about food poisoning. Hope you didn’t enjoy it.
 
Author’s Note: I wrote that last around two days ago in torment. I have finished the chapter, but I’m still a bit queasy even now. Certainly not at my best, but I got the chapter done because writing took my mind off the pain…when I could actually stand and sit. Book-authors don’t tap out due to food poisoning, I’m pretty sure, but this is the genuine web serial experience.
Hope for a healthier me next time. Thanks for reading.
