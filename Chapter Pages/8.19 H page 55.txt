This has been 6 straight days of writing, since I now try to pre-write some stuff. A few notes: the audiobook is out for Book 3 of The Wandering Inn! Give it a listen and congratulations to the winner of the frying pan!
Second…I have another shot scheduled for May 4th, so I might have to take a week off after that? Or an update? I’ll see, but I don’t want to use up my 1-week break so soon. However, I am told the second vaccine sucks.
I don’t have much else to say. I really hoped you enjoyed this long, long arc. Which was very tiring to write. That’s all for me. Thanks for reading.
