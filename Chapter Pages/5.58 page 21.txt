“She couldn’t! She would never threaten one of her teammates. You lie, Garen. She wouldn’t do—”
“I am not lying!”
Garen bellowed at Moore. The half-Giant opened his mouth. Jelaqua interrupted him quietly.
“I think she might have, Moore.”
He made a small noise. Jelaqua looked up at him, her expression bleak. She looked at Garen, shook her head.
“She said that? Exactly? Word for word?”
He nodded. Jelaqua closed her eyes.
“Halassia. She shouldn’t have—and Ukrina would—those idiots always did love their cities, even if they were outcast. They should have waited for me to…”
She trailed off. Moore looked at Jelaqua and then seemed to fold in on himself. The two sat there, and Garen felt a surge of—what? Vindictiveness? Triumph? Relief? It didn’t make him feel better. But then Seborn looked up.
“So what?”
The other two looked at him. Garen did too. Seborn shook his head. His eyes were cold. Unchanged. He looked at Jelaqua,  then straight at Garen.
“So what? This changes nothing. They tried to take the key from you. You were the one who struck first. I saw their bodies. You stabbed the other three before they could so much as move. Only Ukrina fought.”
“I was…”
Garen remembered that moment. He remembered Ukrina pressing him, Halassia insisting. Reaching for the key. Reaching for hope. And the way their expressions changed. He remembered the sword in his hand, making a decision—
“It was not my fault.”
“Wrong.”
Garen shook. He looked at Seborn, at Jelaqua, and at Moore. He whipped his head back and forth.
“Wrong? Wrong? I did nothing wrong! They threatened me! They denied me! To my face! I told them all, the greatest Goblin secrets, and they told me I was wrong. They threatened to kill me.”
“To stop a Goblin King? Absolutely.”
Seborn nodded. Garen shouted at him.
“But I am not a King! I was a teammate! Part of—part of the tribe! A Halfseeker! It was not my fault! I fought with others for years! I gave all to team! But I was betrayed. Again. And again.”
He turned away from the Halfseekers, looked past his tribe. They stared at him, still, silent. Garen spoke, bitterly.
“I have always been betrayed. Before, I would have been my brother’s champion. Strongest warrior in a tribe. But I was betrayed. And then, I would have been part of my team, become Named Adventurer. Found the Goblin King’s treasure, shared it if it could be shared. But I was betrayed. And then I would have fought with Rags as Chieftain. But she betrayed me. Redscar betrayed me and others. And then Tremborag’s tribe betrayed. Reiss betrayed. It is all betrayal. All of you. I did nothing wrong.”
He looked around, pointing at the Halfseekers, at each face in turn. Garen waited for them to acknowledged their guilt, to agree, at last. Now the truth had come out. But they didn’t. They looked at each other. Each face was different. There was pain, regret, and shaken beliefs. But Jelaqua still shook her head. She looked back at Garen.
“But you killed them.”
Garen’s stomach turned over. The Selphid looked at him from behind the dead eyes, and her tone was bitter.
“You keep saying you were betrayed. And they did wrong, Garen. I can’t deny that. They shouldn’t have threatened their teammate. Not like that. But. You. Killed. Them. And that we do not forgive.”
She glanced down at her claws. Then she gazed up at him and her eyes were cold again.
“This changes nothing. Let us go and give us our weapons, Garen. We’ll finish this here in front of your precious tribe.”
He felt as if he’d been punched. Garen looked at Jelaqua. She shook her head.
“Traitor.”
