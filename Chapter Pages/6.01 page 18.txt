Ryoka tried to remember how sunscreen was actually made. That would be something interesting, wouldn’t it? Her mind was racing with all kinds of questions about vampires. And as it happened, they had the time to talk. All the time to talk about silly things. And it wasn’t just Ryoka asking the questions.
“So if you stepped on a nail…”
“That’s my worst nightmare. Rusty nail into bare feet. Or glass. But—look, it doesn’t happen.”
“It has to have happened once.”
“Twice. Ever. Glass is something you can spot. The same goes for metal and other stuff. Dog crap…yeah.”
“That’s disgusting!”
“Three times. And it was all the fault of the owners. Look, the worst thing I ever stepped on was a snail. Once. But nails? Never. And even if you had a normal shoe on, a nail would go right through that, wouldn’t it?”
“True. I stepped on a nail once.”
“How’d that feel, then?”
“Well, vampires don’t feel pain as much as regular people. And it healed up soon after I pulled it out.”
“…I hate you even more.”
“Want to become a vampire?”
“No thanks. I like sitting in the sun. You do know that moonlight’s actually sunlight, just reflected off the moon—er, moons, right?”
“What? That sounds silly. Besides, I can handle some light. Like the shade. It’s just direct light that’s a problem.”
“Okay. Garlic?”
“Hate it. I’m allergic. Dad gets hives if someone so much as brings it into the same room.”
“Gotcha. Uh, silver?”
“It burns. It’s one of the reasons I can’t do alchemy full-time. And it makes me itch if there’s too much of it around.”
“Wood stakes? Through the heart?”
Fierre paused and gave Ryoka a look.
“Would you survive a stake through the heart?”
“Point.”
The girl shrugged.
“We can’t heal if something’s stuck in our bodies. I suppose that’s why. Yes, wood hurts. Silver’s still worse.”
“How about crosses? Holy water?”
“Holy what? And why would a cross bother me? Is that some kind of weapon?”
“Hmm. Never mind.”
That was interesting. Maybe there was a faith component involved. Ryoka didn’t doubt it. She continued down her list.
“Can you…turn into a bat? Mist? And how about entering places uninvited? Crossing streams of water?”
Fierre shifted uncomfortably and shaded her faced with one gloved hand. She already looked slightly tan as the sun rose higher.
“Mist…maybe Bamer would know if that’s possible. He’s the oldest vampire I know. I’ll ask him next time I go back home. As for the rest…I don’t like doing it, but I can. How do you know so much about vampires?”
“Stories.”
“Does your country have an obsession with us or something? Because mother’s bad enough.”
“Oh, believe me. If you met some people…you wouldn’t even have to charm them. They’d be begging you to bite them and pull them into your boudoir. You have one of those, right? And they’d expect you to talk like this. With ve accent, you undershzand? Zuh clazzic mark of zhe vampire.”
“Hahaha! Stop that.”
“Vhat? Vhy are you svo angry? I’m just—hey!”
Fierre suddenly grabbed Ryoka in a headlock. Ryoka wasn’t expecting that and was too slow to pull away. She couldn’t. Fierre looked was shorter and slimmer—but she was strong.
“Gah! Get off!”
Ryoka punched Fierre in the side. The vampire didn’t so much as budge. Ryoka didn’t want to hit her that hard—and then she remembered. Vampire. So she drew back, belted Fierre in the side—and nothing happened. Ryoka blinked, and then tried to swept Fierre’s legs. The girl staggered, and it was Ryoka who fell down.
“Oops. Sorry.”
Fierre bent and helped Ryoka up. The Runner girl stared at Fierre.
“That was embarrassing.”
Another shared grin. Ryoka rubbed at her neck.
