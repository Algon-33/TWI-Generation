I stare at the drink. It’s still half full. I put it to my lips and drink the rest down. The world spins, and the last thing I feel is myself falling backwards. And then, for a few moments, I’m sitting around a camp fire again. Laughing. Happy. And I ask for their forgiveness and know peace.
Until I wake.

Outside the inn, the Frost Faeries watched as Ryoka Griffin collapsed backwards and Erin scrambled to catch her. They hovered outside in the cold, staring through one of the windows. It wasn’t that they couldn’t enter; it was just that they didn’t mind the cold and they didn’t want their conversation to be heard.
 
“The drink is made from the flowers. The innkeeper made it.”
“That’s not supposed to happen. Mortals don’t use the flowers we give them! They’re supposed to throw them away!”
 
The faeries watched as Erin laid Ryoka down and then looked at the other patrons of her inn. They all had the same far-off expression in their eyes.
 
“Should we remove the flowers?”
“But ‘twas a gift! We cannot take it back!”
“What if we gave actual gold? Would that suffice?”
 
Inside the inn, Erin brushed against Klbkch. The Antinium had gone completely still after drinking his mug, just like Selys and Halrac. Now the slight nudge sent him toppling backwards, and like a domino the Drake and Human toppled over as well. The faeries watched as Erin began to panic.
 
“‘Tis funny.”
“Yes.”
 
The faeries paused. They looked at each other.
 
“I wonder what the drink tastes like?”
“Swill, I heard.”
“Good swill?”
 
There was only one way to find out. The faeries swooped into the inn.
 
“Innkeep! A mug of your finest swill!”
 
And both Ryoka and Mrsha slept soundly, dreaming of a happier time. That was, until they woke. But though the dream faded, part of it remained, filling them up. Mending cracks in their hearts. Like a flower, growing in the snow.
