Everyone looked at Stan. He was nodding, looking at Yvlon and Ceria for confirmation.
“I didn’t see it all, but—well, it was after the fight. Yvlon and Ceria here had just been hauled off to the jail—”
“Because they’d brawled with us. That other one too. Pisces?”
Alais muttered, flushing. Yvlon nodded. Kam glanced up sharply.
“The [Necromancer]. Tell us about him. You’re actually working with one? After Liscor?”
“He saved Ceria’s life. Went into the crypt, Kam.”
“Talk about him later! What’s this about the [Bandits]?”
Walt interrupted impatiently. Stan was nodding, and Yvlon was leaning over to whisper with Kam when the [Mages] walked into the tavern. Five of them. At first, no one noticed, but Ceria glanced up muzzily, sensing the magical energy. So did another team captain.
Ulinde, the Selphid, glanced around, and then spotted Ceria at the bar. She pointed the half-Elf out.
“That her, Montressa?”
“Yes.”
The Centaur named Palt was lighting a new roll. He sucked on it and blew out more smoke.
“She’s got companions. Want to wait?”
“Adventurers. They look like Silver-ranks. We can handle them. Let’s not waste time.”
Beza snorted. She still looked at Montressa first. The [Mage] nodded and they all walked forwards.
“Ceria Springwalker.”
Isceil interrupted Stan’s story at the bar. The adventurers turned, most blinking as they saw the five [Mages]. Ceria looked up. She focused on the Drake’s face first.
“Huh? That’s me. Do I know you?”
“No. But you know her.”
The Drake jerked his head over to the young woman. Ceria turned. Yvlon saw her pause uncertainly. And then Ceria dropped her mug.
“Mons? Montressa?”
She jerked out of her seat, standing up unsteadily. Montressa gave Ceria a flat, long stare.
“That’s me. Hello, Ceria. Is your team here?”
“I—Montressa? How did you get here? Tree rot! Is that you?”
Ceria stared unsteadily at Montressa and then went to pinch herself. Yvlon stared. She’d heard Ceria’s tale of her days in Wistram and she vaguely recalled the name. Alais blinked around. She could sense the [Mages] too. She sat up a bit and her tone was respectful.
“Who’s this Ceria? An old friend?”
“I—yes?”
The half-Elf blinked uncertainly at Mons. Worriedly, Yvlon thought. But she smiled and gestured around to Yvlon.
“Everyone, this is Montressa. Montressa, it’s good to see you. Yvlon—meet Montressa. You remember me telling you about her? This is Yvlon, one of my teammates. I—”
She paused. Montressa was just staring at Ceria. Looking the half-Elf up and down. And—Yvlon was rapidly sobering—there was absolutely no warmth in her eyes. Much the opposite. The other [Mages] looked equally…
Slowly, the adventurers put down their cups and all turned. They could all feel it in the air. Ceria’s smile faltered.
“Mons? I have a team. The Horns of Hammerad. And…you know who’s on my team?”
“An old friend. I know. Pisces. I just met him. But I never thought you’d be working with him. Looks like you really haven’t changed.”
Montressa spoke quietly. She stared at Ceria. Yvlon felt her skin crawling. Beside her, Kam gave Yvlon a slow nudge.
“What? You met Pisces?”
“I did. My team and I are all [Mages] from Wistram. We’re here on a mission. We just apprehended Pisces for his crimes. He’ll stand trial in Wistram.”
The room froze over. Ceria stared at Montressa, blinking, not quite comprehending. Her smile vanished. She looked at Montressa, then the other four [Mages].
“What? But—hold on, we were kicked out. The Council exiled us. You can’t—wait, where’s Pisces?”
“What did you do with him?”
