Incredulity. Some of the [Mages] stood up. It was so fast! But it was a circle; they sensed the complete power in it. It engulfed the tables around Eldavin—it didn’t seem to be doing much, but it was a beautifully complex pattern!
“Magnificent.”
Someone murmured. Inscribed magics like spell circles weren’t as common as direct-action spells and this one was elegant! Complete, without perceivable gaps or ebbs and flow in the structure of the spell. It was, well, perfect, such that if you were trying to break or interfere with it, there was no good place to start, no weak point.
Applause. A few [Mages] began applauding Eldavin, standing up to clap. Some of the others hesitated. Eldavin just inhaled.
The Libertarians were caught in the middle of the spell circle, along with Mena, Seky, Soner, and the others. They were beginning to sense something, but it wasn’t apparent.
“What is this spell circle, High Mage?”
“I don’t know…”
Eldavin was murmuring something under his breath. He was drawing magic to him, and now all the Archmages and guests; indeed, the entire hall was staring. The Golems and staff were standing as well—well, that wasn’t accurate. They were in different positions. The staff were frozen uncertainly, but…
Feor snapped his fingers and laughed. Teura turned to him.
“Archmage?”
“Oh, I just remembered. There was a custom before Archmage Zelkyr became the undisputed master of Wistram. A silly thing. If you wanted the Archmage’s attention, in the old days, you just cast a spell and…”
His eyes focused on Eldavin and his voice trailed off. Feor began to stand. Then he saw the serving staff. The mortal, living ones were just staring. But the Golems had moved.
All the Golems were standing against the far walls.
The doors blew open. Cognita, Truestone Golem, a giant marble figure, strode into the banquet hall. She turned to Eldavin. The half-Elf’s head turned.
“Rievan. I don’t feel well. My mana feels like it’s…”
Timor plucked at the [Mage]’s sleeve. Rievan stood up.
“He’s draining our mana!”
He shouted and pointed at Eldavin. The [Grand Mage] pointed back.
“[Blooming Fireball].”
A gigantic orb appeared. It struck the table where the Libertarians were sitting and sent them flying. The plates, tables, and people all went soaring. Charles de Trevalier crashed into a table where the [Depth Mages] were sitting. One of them pushed him off.
Silence. Then, Eldavin pointed at the head table.
“[Valmira’s Comet].”
The second burning spell arced across the floor. The Archmages stared. Viltach raised his hands.
“[Force Sh—]”
Naili dove out of the way of the table. Feor raised his finger.
“[Lightning Bolt]! [Barrier of Scintillation]!”
A shimmering force field appeared around him as the spell hit the comet. It detonated and Viltach went crashing back over the edge of the table. Verdan was knocked back, but his anchoring spell protected him.
Feor stumbled as his shield caught the blast. Eldavin waved his finger around.
“[Firefly].”
Glowing sparks of fire appeared in the air. They dove at the Archmage’s table.
Chaos in the banquet hall! Half the [Mages] were on their feet. The Libertarians not blasted away stared at the [Grand Mage].
“He’s lost his mind! Defend the Archmages!”
That was an extraordinarily stupid comment from a lower-level [Mage]. She pointed her wand and Eldavin pointed a finger.
“Protect yourselves first. Let’s see. [Greater Spellshield]!”
The jet of lightning streaking towards him vanished before it struck him. The Grand Magus saw the [Mage] check herself.
“[Arrows of Light]!”
“[Ice Spike]!”
“[Fireball]!”
