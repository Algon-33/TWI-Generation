Interlude – A Meeting of [Druids]
Page 43
After Chapter Thoughts: Well, we’re over my projected chapter length by…10,000 words. And again, this is a suitable interlude where NOTHING AT ALL…
You know what; I just wanted to call it ‘A Meeting of [Druids]’. That’s a cool interlude title. I hope you enjoyed the craziness. And while not as restful as I would have liked, I enjoyed it a lot. I wish I could have added a few more scenes, but I pushed the limits as-is.
For now, I’ll just say that my break allows me to write like this! And there is much to thank from these wonderful artists!
I’m featuring two artists this time. Firstly, Plushie. Who has made a bunch of Mrsha-emotes! We’re already using them in the Discord server, but they’re so cute on their own! Also, there’s an amazing picture of Bird the Hunter and more!
The second artist is Eris, who has done a sprite of Ryoka Griffin! It would be great in a videogame…give thanks to both of them! Have a good night and thanks for reading!
