The Tier 4 spell conjured a breeze. Montressa felt her own heart beating slower as the wind blew. For a moment—before her natural spell resistance took over—she felt herself draining of the worry, the fear and anxiety—
And Erin was speaking. She waved the lantern. The saddening fire burned bright.
“Hey! Listen. Who’s attacking Hexel? He’s my guest! And Calruz? This isn’t right. I know you all! You know me! Who’s angry at Humans? The Antinium aren’t bad! Let’s all just put down our rocks and stuff, okay? I know you’re mad. But…why don’t we go to my inn? Free drinks! Free cookies!”
The crowd stared at her. The [Mages] kept casting; Montressa saw faces slackening. Staring at Erin. She saw Erin smiling.
“Let’s play some football! Hey—hey, Palt. We’ll get Joseph and Kevin to set it up. A few tactical sports games and everyone will forget about this.”
She turned her head. The Centaur glanced past her. He had the black cigar in his mouth.
“Maybe. But Erin—”
“Hey everyone! Let’s play some soccer instead of smashing things, huh?”
The [Innkeeper] turned back and shouted at the crowd. Her cheerful voice rang out. And Montressa felt something snap.
“Soccer?”
A Drake near Erin blinked. He passed a claw over his face. And Montressa saw—Beza’s [Calm] spell fading from him. He looked at Erin. She smiled.
“Sure. Free drinks, soccer—what about it?”
The bronze-scaled Drake looked at Erin. Just—uncomprehendingly. He stared around. And then his brows crossed.
“Will soccer pay for my rent? I have no more money. What am I supposed to do? I won’t have a home in a week.”
Erin’s smile faltered.
“But—that’s bad. But breaking things doesn’t solve anything. Let’s all calm down.”
The Drake was breathing heavily. Montressa pointed at him.
“[Calm].”
But it didn’t work. Illusions spells lost their potency the more you used them in rapid succession. The Drake’s eyes flickered. Then he stared at the flame. In Erin’s lantern.
He was quicker on the draw. And Erin was being far less subtle about it than when she’d used it on Montressa and Beza.
“What are you doing? That fire—what’s that? You—you think everything’s going to be better if I have a drink and eat a cookie? And kick a stupid damn ball around?”
The other Gnolls and Drakes started. Montressa felt sweat running down her back. She heard Palt muttering.
“[Fog of Apathy]—”
This time mists began to coalesce. Dampening emotion. And it worked—but more and more people were beginning to notice. They pinched each other, gritted their teeth.
And the air became electric. A Gnoll stared at the fire. And then at Erin. He focused on Palt and spoke.
“They’re using spells on us.”
Erin’s face froze. The murmur was muted. People blinked. And then—they all realized it at once. Erin Solstice raised her lantern.
“Listen to me—”
The blue flame went out. The [Innkeeper] stared at it in horror. Palt’s fog tore to wisps and dissipated. Montressa felt her spells fizzling out. She couldn’t even cast [Calm]. In a moment, the air grew hot.
Beilmark cursed as she saw the crowd swing around. Erin Solstice stood there. She focused. Trying to make the others calm. She concentrated—
The dam burst. The Drake screamed in fury. He ran at Erin, a fist raised. Erin dropped the lantern. She was faster. She decked him.
[Minotaur Punch]. The Drake went sprawling. The crowd stared at Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked around. Montressa was backing up.
“I think—”
“Kill them.”
The roar came from dozens of voices. And the mob rushed forwards. If they had been angry before—the calming spells had doubled their fury. Now they tore forwards at Erin—and City Hall.
