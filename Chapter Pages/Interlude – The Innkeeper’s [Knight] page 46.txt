Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 46
Zel Shivertail clapped him on the shoulder. The [General] was approving. Rabbiteater stood straight. He would have fallen, but Erin was there. She looked up at him.
“I’ll be waiting for you to come back. Have an adventure. Do good things. Fall in love. Be silly. Make mistakes. But come back and tell me about it, okay?”
“Okay. I promise.”
He reached for her. But she was gone. The [Knight] stumbled. Then he remembered.
He kept his back straight. The [Soldiers] backed away.
“The—the [General]—”
If he took a single step, he’d fall. He was dizzy. He heard the babbling voice in his head.
 
Level 32—
 
Yes. That was what they’d mistaken. He was not just the Goblin Slayer. Not just Ser Solstice. He was their warrior. They had made him.
Rabbiteater raised a hand and roared. The [Soldiers] fled, dragging their [General].
[Champion]. The Goblin laughed. He swayed—
And the racing figures broke through the camp.
“Ser Solstice!”
Talia Kallinad aimed the spare horse his way. The Order of Seasons was mounted! She had his cloak, streaming behind her, and the axe in her hands. He stared at her.
“Stop them! Stop…”
The [Soldiers] were too afraid to get close to the [Knight] who’d brought down Yerzhen. Talia slowed. She jumped from the saddle, reaching for Rabbiteater.
“He beat the Bear of Ailendamus?”
Voices. Rabbiteater heard the others talking.
“He can’t ride. You—Markus. Get him moving! Cut a path forwards! Move! Move!”
Hands were helping him into the saddle, urging him along. The horse ran next to another. Rabbiteater just sagged against the horse.
“Nice Skills.”
He wondered what Erin would say. Then—the last voice spoke to him. Saying something that made his eyes flutter open.
[Knight-Errant Level 9!]
A knight-errant. A word he barely knew. A [Knight]. But one…who went on quests. A silly [Knight], on an adventure. Who would one day go home.
Believe there was something right. Ahead of him, Talia was riding, glancing back towards the limp figure. Rabbiteater adjusted his helmet, broken nearly to bits. Around him, the Order of Seasons raced like an honor guard.
The light was fading in the evening. The [Knights] streamed away from the camp, and would soon be hard to track. Not that pursuit was organized or coming. The Goblin heard a voice.
“Ser Solstice. Ser Solstice…”
“Bean porridge. What?”
“Your helmet, Ser Solstice…”
Helmet? The Goblin felt at it. It was dented but—what? He looked up. And realized he could see the face of the [Knight] helping him stand in the saddle more clearly. Ser Markus. The Knight of the Spring looked Rabbiteater in the eyes.
“The visor’s up.”
“Oh.”
Slowly, Rabbiteater lowered it. Ser Markus looked at him. Then at Talia, two more who’d helped get him into the saddle.
“We had better get you another helmet.”
Was he blind? The Goblin, the [Knight], the [Champion], wanted to laugh.
“You saw.”
He waited for them to dump him out of the saddle. Ser Markus looked around. He spoke towards Talia’s back, the other two.
“I saw a [Knight] beat a [General] with his bare hands. I’ve seldom seen greater valor in battle.”
“Hear hear!”
One of the other [Knights] shouted, oblivious. Rabbiteater looked at Ser Markus. Then he laughed.

Somewhere else, Erin Solstice sat, weary. But she was smiling. She felt…he was safe. That was all. She sat there, in her room, and looked at an imaginary Goblin.
“Come home someday. Don’t take too long, okay? I’ll be waiting.”
She smiled as he asked a question.
“…I promise.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I declare this to the one of the most AMBITIOUS return-chapters ever. Also, long. Also, two chapters in one.
