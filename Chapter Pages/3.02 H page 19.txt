Ceria whirled around, looking for movement, a deadly spell, a monster, anything. But she saw nothing.
Then something glowed. She turned and saw something on one of the walls. It was…flickering at her. She stared at it. A word? Writing?
No. A magical rune. Ceria instantly tried to look away, but it was too late. She’d already seen it! She tried to close her eyes, but—
“Nothing?”
She stared around. Nothing had happened. She looked over at Ksmvr. He was staring at the magical words. Then he looked at her.
“Ksmvr? Are you okay?”
He hesitated. Then the Antinium nodded. And then he shook his head.
“What?”
He paused.
“I—I am an Aberration. No. I am Antinium.”
“What do you mean? Aberration? Ksmvr?”
He hesitated.
“I—I—I—I—”
He kept repeating the word. Ceria stared at him. Was something wrong? But that was how Ksmvr always acted, wasn’t it? Yes? No?
Why was she talking to an Antinium?
Suddenly, someone grabbed her from behind. Ceria screamed and turned, but it was only Pisces. He stared at her, eyes furious.
“Pisces, what’s wr—”
“What are you doing in bed, boy?”
He screamed the words at her, spittle flying, face red. Ceria jerked backwards, but Pisces had a death-grip on her. He shouted in her ears.
“Fencing practice begins at dawn! Get moving, and I swear, if you shirk I’ll tan your back!”
Something was wrong. Something was right. Ceria knocked Pisces’ hand away and scrambled backwards. She looked around. Yvlon. What was a Yvlon?
“Who are you?”
She was looking down the tip of a sword. A tall, blonde woman stared down at Ceria, chin tilted imperiously upwards as she aimed the sword at Ceria’s nose.
“Explain this uncouth behavior at once. What have you done with me?”
“You? What are you—Yvlon?”
“Ylvon? That is my niece, child. I am Yenelaw Byres, and I demand to know what you have done. What sorcery is this?”
“I don’t know. I—”
Ceria hesitated. Something was wrong. Something was right. Wrong. Right. When two wrongs make a right, who was the shipwright?
“Get moving!”
Pisces howled at Yvlon, pointing his finger at her. She shifted her sword to him and he danced back, suddenly on guard.
“Oh? Angry, are you? Testing me? You’ll have to do better than that, brat.”
“I am Yennais Bryres. Who, pray, are you?”
“I—I—I—help me—I—I—”
Ksmvr was clutching at his head. Pisces and Yvlon were shouting at the same time. Someone had to do something! Ceria opened her mouth, but then realized something dreadful.
I’ve forgotten how to breathe.
She had to tell the others. But she couldn’t breathe! Ceria scrabbled at her throat. She’d tear it out! Then she’d be able to breathe through the hole!
Ksmvr stumbled over to her, head in his hands. Her hands?
“i reJEct. aBErRation Is NoT—I am Antinium. I ReFUSE. i—”
Pisces tapped Ceria on the shoulder. She gasped for air and then stared in horror at the man-sized Creler wearing dirty robes.
“Fencing is a noble art, young man. Don’t you agree? Well, we shall see you master the forms or you will go without dinner tonight.”
A butterfly made of steel turned to Ceria and opened its mouth into Erin’s smiling face.
“What am I doing here? Answer me! You there in the frock!”
She had to do something. Stab them! Stab herself! Didn’t she have a skeleton somewhere around here?
Ceria reached for a dagger, but she’d forgotten what her hands were too. She stared at the pulsating flesh-thing on her hand and tried not to scream. Her palm opened up, and little eyes with twig-like legs started crawling out of the hole in her body.
Everything was normal. That was it. Her head twisted—almost of its own volition and stared around the dark room.
