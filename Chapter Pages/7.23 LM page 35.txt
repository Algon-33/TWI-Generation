The [Princess] caught herself the first time, and then gave her full name. There was no use hiding. They looked at each other. Lyonette noticed Maviola’s worn clothing.
“You—lost your money pouch, right? Ceria wanted to leave some coin for you.”
“Oh. Thank you. I’ll pay her back.”
Maviola accepted the small pouch of coins. She looked at Lyonette. And the two exchanged an unspoken thought.
They looked at each other. And gave each other small smiles. Exchanged a nod.
“Can I get you something to eat?”
“I haven’t had lunch. Thank you. What’s—a ‘lasagna’?”
Lyonette brought her some. Maviola sat down as Olesm spoke to Drassi. The female Drake’s tail began wagging with excitement.
“No way! I can do that! Just give me one second! Where’s the newspaper? Yeah—and if we get a [Scribe]—sure!”
“I talked with Beilmark already. Do you know if I can talk to…Bird?”
“Sure. He’s upstairs.”
Olesm went up the steps. Maviola watched him out of the corner of her eyes as she was served. She gasped at the lovely square of food.
“Oh! I’ve had this in Terandria. It just wasn’t called that.”
“Yes—do you want a drink?”
“Um—some blue fruit juice. Thank you.”
The [Lady] smiled. And then Erin noticed her. The [Innkeeper] had been glancing up, sensing something familiar.
“Oh. Hey. Don’t I know you?”
“Maviola. I was here yesterday. Thank you for having me.”
Erin nodded, vaguely. She opened her mouth, but Joseph was blinking at Apista.
“What is that?”
Maviola turned back to her food, smiling as Erin was distracted. They’d speak again. She reached for her fork—and saw a bold little paw reaching for some of her complimentary fries. Maviola frowned and ducked her head under the table.
Mrsha froze, in the midst of her theft. Maviola’s eyes lit up as the little Gnoll stared boldly at her. The [Lady] laughed. And then fixed a piercing gaze on Mrsha.
“What a beautiful little child. Steal from my plate and face the consequences.”
She bared her teeth. Mrsha stared back at Maviola’s look. Which was young in feature, but in expression—reminded her of the really old granny-Gnolls. Mrsha slowly backed away from her plate.
“I’m so sorry. Did Mrsha bother you? Mrsha! No desserts!”
Lyonette hurried back with the drink. Mrsha fled. The [Princess] hesitated. Then she sat down opposite Maviola.
“Are you—staying in Liscor?”
“Just for a bit. To get away from things. And you?”
“I live here.”
Maviola El glanced up. She looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] saw Maviola laugh, and her eyes lit up.
“It seems fun!”
“It really is. Hard at times, but—I do like it. Are you…? What brought you here?”
Lady Firestarter sipped from her drink.
“One last adventure. But I’ve done this kind of thing more than once.”
“Really?”
Maviola winked at the [Princess]. Lyonette glanced around. She frowned.
“Shoot. Mrsha! Enough! I’m sorry, I have to—”
Mrsha the Invincible was trying to pick a fight with Kevin’s knees. Lyonette sighed; she had to work since Drassi was suddenly very busy with a quill and paper. She looked at Maviola.
“Let’s…talk. When we have the time. I’m busy today, but I have days off.”
“That would be nice. I’m actually following that blue Drake around today. Olesm Swifttail. Do you know him?”
“Yes. He’s actually—a friend of the inn. Sort of. But—he hasn’t been around a lot. It’s complicated.”
Lyonette gestured awkwardly. Maviola leaned forwards.
“I know. Can I get another lasagna for him? He’ll want to speak to you as well.”
“Me? What for?”
“You’ll see.”
Maviola sat back. When Olesm came down, bursting with excitement, Lyonette sat down at the table. She blinked. But then agreed to his idea.
