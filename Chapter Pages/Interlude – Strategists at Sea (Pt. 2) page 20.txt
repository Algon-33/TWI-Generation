Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)
Page 20
Wil pointed at Therrium. The [Depth Captain] recoiled. He saw more sand-warriors coming out of the sandstorm whirling around him. And—four [Strategists] plus two [Commanders] were combining their abilities. He spun around.
“Back to the ship! Fall back!”
The Drowned Crews needed no encouragement. They streamed back to the ship. Wil exhaled. He looked at Venaz. Then—they turned.
“[Unit: Enhanced Strength]! [Unstoppable Advance]!”
The Minotaur began chanting again as Wil and the other [Storm Sailors] faced the second crew. The other [Depth Captain] saw Wil pointing.
“[Ram’s Charge]. [Blades of Glory]! [Everpiercing Swords]! [Unit: Form of Giants]—”
The [Strategist] saw her face pale. She shouted.
“Retreat! Let them burn their Skills!”
Her crew ran, as the sand-apparitions followed. Wil grinned. He didn’t have [Blades of Glory], or the other Skills he was shouting. The [Storm Sailors] rushed forwards, cutting the lines. Venaz was laughing.
Neither crew realized or remembered they’d used the Skills in a battle not ten minutes ago! They had to recharge! It didn’t take either [Depth Captain] long to realize the trick. They howled, but the gangplanks and ropes had been thrown off the ship. And The Emerald Signet was moving.
“After them!”
Captain Therrium was red in the face. He saw the [Storm Captain] unfurling a scroll.
“[Galewinds]!”
Lasc shouted. Instantly, a breeze filled The Emerald Signet’s sails. It shot forwards as the two Drowned Ships turned. And still—the sandstorm was battering the two ships.
For six more minutes. Captain Therrium was shielding his face. He cursed Fetohep’s magical protections. He’d grab the chest and strip them one layer at a time. He knew curses!

The Emerald Signet emerged from the sandstorm with the two Drowned Ships in hot pursuit. Captain Lasc had a death-grip on his ship’s helm. His lookouts were shouting information as Delivan strode to the back of the ship.
“Permission to fire ship-spells, Captain?”
“Granted!”
“Aye, sir! [Depth Explosion]!”
A blast rocked The Passing Shadow. Therrium’s ship listed for a second—but it was reinforced.
“Damn! They have armor on them! These aren’t ordinary Drowned Ships! And they’re fast!”
“Not as fast as we are! Which is why they’re throwing spells! Brace!”
Inky shouted. She was halfway up the mast, staring backwards. She dropped to the deck as magical bolts of light began shooting from the other ships.
“Dead gods, that’s a bombardment spell! Watch out! Those are [Light Spears]!”
Dozens of the oversized magical arrows were hitting The Emerald Signet. Wil saw one burn a [Sailor] off her feet. He took cover behind the mast with the others.
“Take cover! We’re gaining! We’re headed straight for the House of Minos!”
Captain Lasc bellowed, ignoring the spells raining down around him. Two tore through the sails and he swore as the spells caught the fabric on fire.
“Douse those flames! Get to cover and get the wounded belowdecks! Drop all unnecessary cargo!”
He was steering the ship, trading some speed for a slight variation in their movement. A huge blast of fire missed the sails as Lasc spun the wheel, anticipating it. Helplessly, the students could only watch the other two ships gaining.
“We have to do something!”
“King Fetohep—can you help—King Fetohep?”
Wil turned. The casket was inert again. Merrik swore.
“Damn. I knew something was up! The ‘curse’ must have limited magic! No wonder the [King] wanted us to take the casket!”
“Don’t worry. A [Storm Ship] can outmaneuver Drowned Ships. And Lasc has a final option if we keep our distance. We can do this—”
