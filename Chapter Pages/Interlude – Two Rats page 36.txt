Interlude – Two Rats
Page 36
This was how the tale ended. The important tale, that was. It was with a half-Elf. A day later. The Minotaur still felt his healed wounds. And he still bore the marks. But neither one talked about it.
“Well, the election’s today.”
“Really?”
Calruz looked up. He was staring at a basket and a book and a strange, symmetrical bar and round thing lying on the ground. It was made of metal and heavy when he picked it up. Ceria had pushed them through. The half-Elf shrugged self-consciously.
“Yup.”
“I thought it was later. Or rather, I had the impression it was an ongoing issue.”
“Nope. It was only a week, remember? I guess this was the last big day.”
“And so my fate is part of the election.”
The Minotaur carefully inspected the basket. It was…moving. Ceria smiled, her face pale.
“Maybe. You know, Lism dropped the line about executing you horribly. But he’s shouting about all the rest. So’s Krshia. She told Erin in private that she’d let you live if she was elected.”
“Hm. What’s this object for, Ceria? And the book?”
“Oh. I bought it in the market. It wasn’t much. I think it’s battle tactics or something.”
“The Conquests of Tulm the Mithril, a History, Hrm. It must be new. I haven’t read about him. I know the name of course. You got it from Pallass, of course.”
The Minotaur picked up the book and opened it awkwardly with his one arm. Ceria smiled faintly.
“I did. I can’t believe I didn’t think to bring them before. Uh—Krshia said—”
“I heard you. What made her change her mind? I cannot imagine the Gnolls would want me to live. Isn’t she taking a risk?”
“Well, yes. She’s betting on Erin’s support. Wild, isn’t it? But I think something else convinced the Gnolls to pass on demanding your execution as part of her winning.”
Calruz looked up from the book and put it down next to his cot. He eyed the basket again.
“Really? Which is?”
“You saying how much you’d rather die than stay in the cell. Uh—the Gnolls thought it would be better to let you live in that case. Some of them, anyways. Fancy that?”
The half-Elf smiled. Calruz stared at her. Then he guffawed.
“That’s what they said?”
He laughed until his still-healing lungs wheezed and he sat down. He shook his head as Ceria stared at him.
“Alright. What’s this heavy thing?”
“A barbell.”
“A what?”
“It’s a weight. Something you lift to build muscle. There’s also a bar with weights—Erin said you need two hands for that, though. She asked me to bring it here.”
“Why? I’m…grateful. It’s an interesting idea. But why?”
Ceria shrugged.
“I don’t know. She didn’t want to come, but she said it was cruel to leave you without anything to do. And apparently uh, the weights fit a prison? That’s Erin’s logic. Don’t ask me to explain it.”
“Very well. And what’s this?”
At last the Minotaur shifted his attention to the basket. He opened the lid and recoiled. Ceria grinned at his expression.
“That’s a…problem from the inn. Lyonette decided they weren’t allowed there and we had no idea what to do. If we threw them out, they’d probably come back to the inn. So it was Mrsha—”
“The Gnoll child?”
Calruz looked up, and an expression of pain crossed his face. Ceria nodded, losing her smile.
“Yeah. Her. She wanted to give it to you.”
“Me?”
The Minotaur stared down at the two little rats, moving around the padded basket. One nibbled at a bit of cheese. The other looked up and inspected him warily. What new fate was this? What hell of tortures, what odyssey of strange lands?
