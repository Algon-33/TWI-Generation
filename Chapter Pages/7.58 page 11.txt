She tried again. This time Ryoka struggled.
“What are you doing?”
“Giving you my boon! It’s a Skill! If you’re going to—why isn’t it working? Please don’t tell me I have to kiss anywhere else. I don’t even think—what’s wrong?”
Ryoka spluttered. She got Lyonette off her.
“What? A boon? Lyonette—I don’t think it’ll work. I’m not really part of…the leveling system.”
“But—”
The [Princess] gave up. She looked at Ryoka. The two stared at each other—then started chuckling. Lyonette shook her head.
“I’ve ruined the moment. Go. If you have to go—promise me you’ll come back. For all of us. And say goodbye to Mrsha.”
“I promise. I swear.”
Ryoka looked up. Lyonette smiled. Then she left.
For a few minutes, Ryoka sat there, wiping saliva off her forehead. She felt teary, stupid—why hadn’t she thought of how much it would wreck Mrsha, thinking she was going to die?—and still, resolute.
But shakily. It could break. It might break. Ryoka took a breath.
“Erin? Do you have anything else to add?”
Someone opened the door. Erin was even tearier than Lyonette and Ryoka had been. She blew her nose.
“One seconb. I’b stuffy.”
“Ew.”
Ryoka waited as Erin cleaned her face. The [Innkeeper] had been listening. When she came into the room, she looked at Ryoka.
“I was—going to hit you and tie you up in the basement.”
“Please don’t. I have to do this.”
“Do you?”
Erin sat down. She tried to speak coherently, but it was hard. She was hiccupping, now.
“If—Ryoka. If you die—why do you—have to—?”
Ryoka smiled slightly. It was time to explain. And to Erin—it was a different explanation. She had told Lyonette the truth. That was why Ryoka Griffin had been such an angry young woman. Part of it, anyways. But there was another reason.
“Erin. I want to see Ivolethe again. Because she has something I need. The wind. I regret giving up my levels, Erin. My classes.”
“Can’t you w—”
“No I can’t. Not for the winter. Not another year. Everything’s happening too fast, Erin. Earthers in this world, war—I can’t.”
Ryoka met Erin’s eyes. The [Innkeeper] stared at her through a red-rimmed gaze. Ryoka went on, slowly.
“We cannot wait for better days. The ability to change the world—I would do almost anything for it short of losing myself. It’s one thing to try to be good. But good intentions are nothing without power. And that’s why I need to meet Ivolethe. Also—because it’s the right thing. But also because of that. So I can do this run. Other runs, without endangering my life like this time.”
It was a circular thing. Risk your life to get stronger so you didn’t risk your life. But wasn’t that how leveling worked? Erin shook her head.
“You want levels?”
“I do. I should have become a [Runner]. Because look at you, Erin. You can do so much. If we got into a fight—you would probably win. Your inn is a fortress. You have so many Skills—I want that power.”
Erin’s face was troubled.
“Ryoka. That’s not why I leveled up. Power corrupts. Absolute power—”
Ryoka cut her off, shaking her head rapidly.
“No. Don’t say that, Erin. It’s something people say and it drives me crazy. Like ‘the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over’. That’s not what insanity is. And Einstein didn’t say it. It’s a stupid quote, like ‘power corrupts’.”
“But it’s true, right?”
Erin saw her friend snort gently. Ryoka rolled her shoulder, stretching out one arm.
