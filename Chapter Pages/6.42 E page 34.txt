Gralton leans over. I hear Gamel exclaim. The [Dog Lord] frowns. The rain’s falling, but I’m shrugging off my cloak. It’s hot. I hear him muttering, reading out loud.
“They’re coming—no, they’re notifying you they’re sending—what in the name of—”
Impatiently, I turn my head.
“Yitton, can you read it out loud? Gralton, hand it to—”
And then I feel it. One second it’s gone, and then it’s blazing in my head. I shout and the horse rears. I can’t grab at the reins. I can feel myself falling, hear a bellow from Gralton. And Yitton catches me halfway down. But that’s not what makes me shout. I can’t hear Gamel shouting at me, Yitton’s voice.
It’s in my head! No! My eyes! It’s so—I push at my eyes.
“What’s—god! What’s happening—”
“Laken! What is it?”
I flail wildly. It’s right there! What is—I’ve never—
And then I realize. It’s light.
Light. In my head. A beacon. Blazing. I can feel it. Coming north. And west. From Riverfarm. I sit up, shaking. It’s burning. I twist as the others swing from the saddles.
“Your Majesty, what’s happening?”
“Are we under attack? Is it Riverfarm?”
Gralton draws a sword. Yitton’s supporting me. I shake my head. Croak.
“Gralton, ride.”
He pauses. Then gets what I mean. I hear an intake of breath. All I can do is feel the beacon in my head. They’re there. Intruders! A fiery blaze. And she’s there too. I can feel them. Gralton whistles. I hear a horse trotting.
“It’ll take me three days to get to my estates! I can bring an army to Riverfarm in two days!”
“Do it.”
He doesn’t wait for a reply, but takes off, roaring for the caravan and his guards. I stand up, shaking. Gamel’s chasing a horse. Yitton supports me.
“What is it?”
“The Order of Seasons sent someone. Belavierr’s there too. They’re—trouble, Yitton. Something is happening in Riverfarm. And I’m not there.”
Five days. I try to shut my eyes, but the light’s still there. I should have sent Gralton the instant the coven arrived.
“I can’t leave the Goblins. If I do—”
Can I? I leave, and what does Yitton do? The [Guards]—I hesitate. Yitton makes the decision for me. He snaps as people gallop towards us, shouting urgent questions.
“We push on. Fastest speed. Tell the [Mages] to prepare [Light] spells for night riding. We’re pushing on through the night! We will be at Riverfarm in exactly five days!”
He overrides the objections, snapping orders with uncharacteristic force. The people withdraw. I’m still standing. Yitton speaks urgently to me.
“Laken. If you ride now, there is no guarantee you’ll be able to stop whatever’s there. Wait for Gralton to bring an army to bear. He can muster thousands. More if need be. This could be targeted at you. A magic-user can easily attack you with a small escort. You cannot risk your life.”
I know. I know that. But I stand there. Listening to Yitton talk about five days. Riverfarm holding out. And I think of a [Witch] that could hang a village in a night. A blazing [Knight]. Fire and conspiracy and death.
Durene’s there. Prost, Rie. Ryoka, Frostwing, Bismarck. I turn my head north and west. And I climb in the carriage as it rolls forwards, as the caravan doubles its pace and Gralton and his escort race ahead.
I know in my marrow, in the burning in my eyes, that we will be too late.
