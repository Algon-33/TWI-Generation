They wore Galuc’s body. They did not know him. They did not deserve even the flawed copies of him.
And Pawn. Klbkch stood up. He fell down. Relc was pleading for him to stop. A [Priest]? A class made of the very thing they fought against. Why had he allowed Pawn to be an [Acolyte]? No, no.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong. Wrong.
Wrongwrongwrongwrongwrongwrongwrongwrong—
Wrong, it was all wrong. They should have been true. Should have known their destiny. Should have been together. But he was alone. He and the Free Queen, and she was a child who had to try and live up to legends. But she couldn’t. She didn’t even know what they were. Klbkch was the only one who remained.
He was alone.
Klbkch screamed, a sound coming from the very depths of his hopeless soul. He leapt. Berserk with fury, rage. But—it was the cruelty of it.
Rage did nothing. Look at him. Relc’s fist sent him sprawling. Sent green blood painting the cobblestones as the Walled Cities watched and rejoiced, vicious, victorious.
And now the Drake was pleading.
“Klb. Don’t make me do this. We’re pals.”
Klbkch lay on the ground. And Relc’s voice, the word. Pleading. With that emotion.
That—at last, was what made him snap.
The Antinium stood. In the dark street, surrounded by the crowd. Facing the Drake. Illuminated by the glow of the scrying orb. And his voice—
“fRieNDS? yOU dOn’t knOW ME. NoNe oF YOu dO.”
He looked at Relc. The Drake closed his eyes. Then he looked at Klbkch.
“Well, come on, then, buddy. Show me.”
Klbkch charged. He moved, faster than he ever had. Leaping. He saw the fist coming down.
He struck Relc across the chest. The Drake staggered. Punch, coming up. Klbkch saw it. He jerked back.
He was a warrior of the True Antinium. Centenium. He had battled monsters this world had never known! Dark dreams of a sleeping god. Things as terrible as Crelers.
Worse. He had lived through wars that Relc had never known. He saw it all. The Drake, moving, for a punch from his left, then a kick.
Dodge. Leg-hook. Klbkch threw Relc and leapt on him. The Drakes roared as Relc hit the ground, trying to roll, took a kick. But—
The Drake took a blow with all of Klbkch’s weight to his face. And his scales tore and bled. But still—he stood. And when he punched—it was so fast—
Klbkch tried to dodge. And the blow carried him into the crowd. Broken, he felt his chitin cracking. And it was so unfair.
The Antinium refused to fall. Refused to stop, as Relc set himself, pleading. But he was so weak. Klbkch ran forwards, fell.
Fell again. And even the watching crowd began to feel for him. His helpless fury. The scream that didn’t stop. All but the ones who hated Antinium with no quarter. Who—rejoiced.
And that was all. As Klbkch fell and rose, there was no changing. No matter how he strained, his body wasn’t enough. His rage could not change anything. True Antinium never broke. But his soul far exceeded his flesh.
Nothing more. It would continue until Relc stopped hitting his friend. Weeping at the sight of the broken chitin and green blood. Continue, for Klbkch was—
Worthless. The Antinium could do nothing. Nothing to change. He had died too many times. Lost too much of what he had been.
As he fell. Klbkch could not have known this. He had not been there. But the [Princess] had learned it just this morning. It was just a fact.
As Zevara watched him fall, reaching out to call an end to it. As Relc stared at Klbkch, willing him not to stand. As 4th Company shouted, reveling. The leaders of the Walled Cities smiled, seeing the Slayer fall.
Just a fact.
Did you…
Klbkch’s head hit the pavement. Cracking.
