The [Bard]’s lips turned into a smile. He tapped his chest.
“Yes. I Numbtongue.”
“Careful. You don’t know what tribe he’s from. This is a mess.”
Reiss sat there. Numbtongue ignored him. It was…harder to ignore Pyrite’s voice though. The Hobgoblin was telling him something and in Pyrite’s way, he had attached a big warning sign to it.
Tattoos. His ability in fighting. Not a Redfang, clearly. This Goblin can only come from one tribe. Be careful.
The smaller Goblin slapped his chest as he put one of the daggers in his belt.
“Nolocks. [Deadly Skulker]. You save me. You are here? In this…safe place?”
He stared around the Garden wonderingly. Numbtongue nodded. How did he even explain Erin to someone? But Nolocks had sensed the inn.
“Yes. This is a safe place. The—owner is a friend to Goblins.”
“Friend to Goblins. Hah! Good joke!”
Nolocks chortled and slapped his thigh. Then he stared back to where the door had been.
“That Human?”
“Yes. You…Nolocks, what is your tribe? I never seen that before. Where?”
Numbtongue touched the Goblin’s tattoos gently. The [Skulker] grinned. He tapped the one right above a bicep. It was…a fish? The tattoos were cruder than the ones Wailant had, stylized.
“Kraken Eater Tribe. Chieftain is Naumel. Naumel, biggest Goblin in the world. Strongest! He come.”
Kraken Eater Tribe? Pyrite’s memories sang. He knew that tribe! One of the strongest in the north. Along with the Molten Stone tribe and Mountain City tribe. Their Chieftain was huge, a fighting maniac. He’d once come to fight Pyrite and nearly killed the Goldstone Chieftain.
He had killed more adventurers than most Goblins ever met. And his tribe moved around the coast—even across the sea to evade pursuit.
“Your Chieftain is coming?”
Nolocks shrugged. He switched to the Goblin tongue to explain.
“Big-big fight. Warriors captured. North. Chieftain knows. Chieftain lived—sent magic from Molten Stone tribe. Will come if I don’t go. Always fights. Fight here, fight there…doesn’t matter. Someday, Chieftain come to Invrisil.”
For war. Numbtongue saw Reiss shift. The Goblin Lord stared at Nolocks. He spoke.
“I sent emissaries to both Chieftains, along with Tremborag. All three refused. They refused Velan the Kind as well. Well—the [Witch] did, and Tremborag. This Kraken Eater’s Chieftain might be too young. But I have heard rumors he is as large as Tremborag.”
Nolocks was oblivious to the commentary. He swung his free dagger, excited by the idea. The loss of his fellow Goblins didn’t seem to bother him.
“Saw Arcsinger. Elia Arcsinger.”
Numbtongue felt a chill. Her. He nodded. Nolocks grinned.
“When Chieftain hears—he will come. To Invrisil. He come and kill Humans. Kill adventurers.”
“No.”
Numbtongue reached out, pushed Nolocks slightly. The [Skulker] blinked.
“No?”
“No killing Humans. This inn—it has a rule. ‘No Killing Goblins’. So—no killing Humans. Or Gnolls. Or Antinium.”
“What Antrininium?”
“Bug-people.”
“Huh. No kill?”
The [Bard] batted the dagger down. Hob to Goblin, he explained.
“No killing anyone. I—am Numbtongue. Former Redfang. I protect this place. Kill only people who attack. Monsters. Human [Innkeeper] who is friend? That is Erin Solstice. I protect her.”
Nolock’s eyes flickered to the door.
“Strange. You like?”
He grinned at Numbtongue; the [Bard] had forgotten how perceptive fellow Goblins were. Nolocks made a gesture.
“Human for babies?”
“No! Stop that!”
The Redfang smacked Nolocks on the head. The [Skulker] growled, then laughed.
“Okay. No kill! No kill! Promise. Promise by Chieftain.”
