Ksmvr piped up, looking at Pisces. The [Necromancer] flushed. Ceria saw him open his mouth and snap down at Ksmvr.
“My peers? Where are they? If I find anyone worthy of sharing my thoughts with, I will be pleasantly surprised!”
The Antinium flinched. He stared up at Pisces and then looked down.
“Oh. I am sorry for presuming.”
“Pisces! Apologize to Ksmvr!”
Yvlon shot to her feet. She glared at Pisces. He was flushed as he glared at her. The armored woman narrowed her eyes.
“You’re out of line. Who cares if you’re common-born? You’re overreacting. We know the bounty poster is false. You don’t have to take it out on Ksmvr because you’re embarrassed we know you’re not from an aristocratic house! It doesn’t matter!”
It was the wrong thing to say. Pisces’s eyes widened. He stared at Yvlon for one second and then spoke.
“Spoken like a noble child.”
Yvlon’s cheeks went white. She sat down abruptly and said not a word more. Ceria stared at Pisces. Those cutting words. She clenched her fists.
“You jackass! We put ourselves on the line trying to help you! We’re your team! Don’t we deserve at least some answers—”
“Why? So you can lecture me on how wrong I am? Turn up your nose until you have need of my abilities?”
Pisces whirled on Ceria. She took a step back.
“I—you know Montressa has a reason for her fury! You know that, Pisces! I’m angrier than anyone about what she did! But you have to remember what happened! She does! She broke down when she saw the undead illusion! Pisces! Calvaron and all the others—”
“What of them?”
Ceria had to say it.
“It was your fault they died. It was an accident, but they died. You know why Montressa blames you. I’ve forgiven you. But it was still your fault. If you won’t admit that—you’re every bit the monster that Minotauress called you.”
The table went silent. The room went silent. Everyone stared at Ceria. Pisces looked at her. He was shaking. When he opened his mouth, his voice was wavering. But not with guilt. Not with regret. With pure rage.
“I don’t regret it now. Not at all. I meant every word I said. Calvaron? I don’t even recall his face. I only wish that curse had killed all of Wistram! All of them and—”
Ceria punched him in the face. If it was a movie, it should have been a slap. But Ceria was an adventurer. Pisces’ head jerked back and he stumbled, nearly falling into his chair. Ksmvr caught him, but Pisces struck his hand away. Silently, he looked at Ceria.
She was breathing hard, staring at him, appalled by what she’d done.
“Pisces, I—”
He whirled and strode away. Ceria saw him storming up the stairs to his room. Erin was frozen at the bar. Lyonette stared at Pisces. Mrsha was gone.
In the silence afterwards, Ceria looked at Yvlon and Ksmvr. She worked her mouth silently.
“I—damn it. Dead gods damn it.”
She sat back down. Why did she say it? Now? But Pisces had been—her team sat around her. And the mood in the air was like filth, like bitterness given form. Ceria wanted to go back and break her fist on Montressa and her team. She hated them. Hated Pisces for being him. She sat there—

Erin saw it all. And still, she hesitated. She could see herself going over to the team, or following Pisces. And…she had seen it before. She remembered a young woman. Ryoka. But this was even worse. She ached for Pisces. And for the Horns. She tried to do something. But nothing fit.
A square peg in a round hole. Or…a complicated mess, that no one shining bullet could solve. Nothing Erin had. She got up, abruptly.
“I’m going out. Lyonette, keep an eye on the inn.”
“Sure. Mrsha? Where’d she go? Mrsha?”
