Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 40
“They were here. They stood in this place. And I will never forget it! This inn will not forget they were here. My silly friends. My heroes. My protectors.” 
The words of Ser Solstice were clenched in one fist, the paper crumpling. Erin shouted at him.
“You were right here. I asked you to die for me! Okay? Enough? It’s never enough! You will always be here. Even when you leave!”
The statues in the garden. Numbtongue’s claws dug into her shoulder. The ghost of the Goblin Lord watched. Slowly, he reached out and touched her shoulder.
Then there was light. Selys was wavering, wondering why Erin was so upset. She threw up her claws as she rushed towards Erin along with the others.
Flame. It burned around her, a flash so brilliant the others put up their hands to shield their eyes. Erin did not reach for it.
It was not a color they knew. For a moment—then Selys stumbled. The floorboards, the walls!
The inn was shaking.
“What is happening?”
Bird shouted from his tower. Below, Erin Solstice raised her hand. She broke past distance. Reaching out.
She was no [King]. But he had sat in this inn! He was her guest!
And she would never forget that. She shouted the words into the sky.
“[Boon of the Guest: Zel Shivertail]!”
Altestiel’s eyes widened. Lyonette gasped.

The visor popped up. The [Soldiers] stared—and then recoiled.
“G—”
The Goblin sat there. Eyes wide. Blinking into the light. Had he heard that right? The [Soldier] reached for his sword as the [Mage] jerked, his fingers to his temple.
“Impossible.”
“It’s a fucking—kill it! Kill—”
The other [Soldiers] didn’t know what the three had seen. They moved, to stop the disgrace to Ailendamus’ name. Seeing the crimson eyes and green skin, recoiling. The ones holding Rabbiteater tightened their grip.
Too late. Too slow. The four [Soldiers] went flying.
The [Mage], Telich, stared blankly as a figure rose. He saw the visor close. Then a crimson flash from between the visor’s slits. He looked blankly at the [Soldiers] on the ground.
“What are you doing? Wh—”
Rabbiteater grabbed him. Telich cried out.
“[Flame J—]”
A claw like a razor severed his throat. It had gone through the steel gauntlets! The Hobgoblin stared at his hands.
“Kill it! Kill the Go—”
He lowered the dying mage. He saw a [Soldier] jump at him, snarling, a spiked brass knuckle aiming for his head. He was so—
Rabbiteater punched and stepped back. He saw the man’s head snap back—back—
The dead Human dropped like a sack onto the ground. The other [Soldiers] stared in horror.
“But he was a [Brawler]—”
They looked at the [Knight] as he regarded the claw sticking out of his gauntlets. A razor’s edge. Yet—his armor was gleaming. Reinforced.
An arrow bounced off the chest plate. The figure had already been dodging. He leapt forwards. The [Archer] put up his arms to block.
The second blow broke both arms and the man’s face. The [Knight] whirled. The [Soldiers] stared in horror at the crimson light shining from his visor. One of them whispered.
“Ailendamus save us.”

“Prisoner escape!”
“Again?”
The bellow came from General Yerzhen’s tent. He emerged to see the army’s camp in chaos once more.
The [Knights] were free! They’d broken out of the manacles! How?
The answer was Talia Kallinad. Her armor was glowing from the heat of her aura. She’d melted the manacles on her and her comrades. They were burned from the heat. But they fought with a furious intensity.
“What’s happening? They were ransomed!”
The half-Elf [Captain of the Fist] was incredulous. Then he heard the shouts.
“Ser Solstice! Where is he?”
“Those damned idiots!”
