One swung at her. Wind blew him from the saddle. Charlay and Ryoka’s dust clouds were whipping the air, throwing the [Bandits] off. But Ryoka was alone and there were twelve, the [Pyromancer] and men and women with weapons, riding at her, fighting their horses. Twelve. And Durene was—no, wait. Eleven?
Something moved in the cloud. Ryoka saw a man jerk and fly off his horse. He hit the ground and Ryoka saw what had knocked him from the saddle.
A quarterstaff. As the man lay, winded, the hands holding the quarterstaff withdrew. He sat up and Durene’s foot came down. The man screamed before Durene stomped. The other [Bandits] looked up.
“Dead gods, what is that?”
They hadn’t seen Durene behind the wagon. The [Pyromancer] turned in alarm, pointed his staff.
“[Fast Fireball]—”
“Durene!”
The half-Troll girl raised her arms. The second explosion engulfed her. Ryoka screamed. No! She ran forwards; saw a woman swinging on her from the right. Ryoka tried to dodge. A blade clipped her back, laying it open. The pain made Ryoka scream, but she ran. The [Bandit] followed her. She raised her sword for another strike—
And someone roared. Ryoka jerked, dodged left. A huge shape crashed into the horse. The animal and rider went down. The [Bandit] turned and saw a huge mouth snapping at her. It was her turn to scream.
It was the last sound she made. Bismarck bit, worried the corpse, tossed it, and turned. The other [Bandits] descending on Ryoka noticed the Mossbear through the dust too late. The Mossbear tore a man from the saddle and dropped on him. The paw hit the man’s chest with a dull crunch.
“It’s a damned bear! I told you!”
“Kill it! Kill it! Mafial!”
“Move clear you idiots!”
The [Pyromancer] bellowed. He shot a thin stream and Bismarck roared, flinching away from the fire. The [Pyromancer] lifted his burning staff as the other [Bandits] rode clear.
“[Fireb—]”
A huge hand grabbed his horse. The [Mage] jerked and looked down. Durene howled as she tossed the man from the saddle. The man flew and Durene swung her staff. A man riding towards her caught the blow. He was wearing chainmail, but the metal did nothing as his ribs snapped.  He fell, screaming, choking.
Ryoka stared. Durene lifted the staff and swung it, still screaming in pain. She was half-blinded by the [Fireball], but it hadn’t brought her down. In fact—her staff caught another [Rider] and he tumbled.
“Shoot her—”
An arrow hit Durene in the chest. She staggered and the [Bandit] holding the crossbow lowered it, dumbfounded. The arrow had stuck in Durene’s skin, barely two inches deep. She howled and the man on the ground raised his shield. He had a shield. Armor. And all she had was a staff.
But it was thick. A walking staff. A quarterstaff. And it came down with all of Durene’s strength. The thud as it struck the man’s helmet stayed with Ryoka as she stumbled forwards. She flung a caltrop, called the wind.
The [Pyromancer] was alive. He was winded, but he got up as Ryoka tried to bombard him with grit and caltrops. He snarled, pointing his staff at her as his bloody eye and good one focused on her. Ryoka leapt sideways.
The two faced each other as the [Bandits] circled, fighting Bismarck and Durene. Ryoka grabbed for another Tripvine bag, her caltrops—the [Pyromancer] raised his staff and she knew she was too close. She tensed—and her eyes widened.
“Wiskeria?”
The [Pyromancer]’s head turned. Someone was walking out of the destroyed wagon’s front. It was…a [Witch].
