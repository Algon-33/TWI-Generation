“What?”
The Dragon blinked at Erin’s whisper. The young woman looked at him. She paused.
“Nothing.”
She did not trust him. Not yet. Ryoka said this was a good person. She trusted Eldavin. But Erin didn’t know him. She looked up at Eldavin. She knew literally nothing. Even Montressa and Bezale didn’t know anything. Palt only had rumors of the half-Elven [Grand Mage] who had once been part of Wistram.
“Can I ask why you’re friends with Ryoka?”
“Friends?”
The question seemed to offend the half-Elf. He frowned.
“She has done me some services in the past. And she has…rendered services to me. I owe her a debt due to our bargain. We are not friends.”
Erin eyed the laptop under his arm. A copy of Kevin’s. She nodded slowly.
Power. That was scary power if he’d actually duplicated the laptop. But what…who was Eldavin? Erin felt like she was only seeing a fraction of him, as weird as that was. And it made her wary. She knew he was powerful. Scarily powerful.
“I’m um. An [Innkeeper].”
“Yes. That fact is apparent. What is your point?”
He was also pretty rude. The Grand Magus snorted at Erin, impatiently. She frowned. But went on, scuffing at the ground.
“You…you’re pretty good at magic and stuff, right? High-level?”
“One could infer so.”
The Dragon cautiously replied. He had no idea where the young woman was going with this. She looked up.
“Um. I just wanted to ask. Since you’re here and all…you must have lived a long time.”
“You could say that too.”
He whispered. The Human child looked up at him. And he, finally, saw her nervousness. Uncertainty.
“I was hoping you had some advice. I’m sort of…high-level myself. And this inn is cool. The [Garden of Sanctuary] is strong. You said it yourself. But every time something bad happens—Magnolia Reinhart was in here a little bit ago. And I couldn’t stop her.”
Teriarch blinked. She had? He consulted his notes, searching the [Messages] he collected and read for news about that. Erin went on.
“I level up. But when something bad happens, I can’t stop it. I was wondering…if you had any advice. I mean, I know you’re a [Mage] and I’m an [Innkeeper]—but what do you do? To keep people alive?”
The question made the Dragon stop. He looked down at the [Innkeeper]. And suddenly—his focus was on her, not watching the War of Stars or whatever it was called with Ryoka Griffin.
Slowly, the Dragon replied. Searching Erin’s honest face.
“…Erin Solstice. You are quite talented for an [Innkeeper] of your age. This inn proves it.”
“Thanks.”
She looked up at him. The Dragon went on, looking at Erin. Seeing all the other [Innkeepers] he had ever met flash through her. None had ever been honored with the [Garden of Sanctuary]. But some had been…
“There have been legends, girl. Who reached levels higher than yours by your age. They come—as you do—by virtue of the challenges they surmounted. I cannot ever remember an [Innkeeper] who rose as you did. But [Warriors]? [Mages]? Of all kinds, I have met them.”
She was silent. Listening. The Dragon went on, his voice turning older. If you closed your eyes, you could almost see them in his words.
“Those grand heroes died. Many, in small places, by accident, as their enemies overwhelmed them. By chance. Never forget that. Some became legends. But ultimately—they all died. Some were so mighty that they could slay entire armies themselves. Some had vast empires. And even then—they fell to a blade in the back. A greater foe than themselves.”
He was bad at pep talks. But he was good at honesty. The old being went on, looking at Erin.
“Are you asking how to make your inn safe?”
