Erin looked around. Black-bodied Worker Antinium filled the street. They stood in front of her. Suddenly, they all bowed their heads and the Worker in front spoke.
“These ones offer condolences to the Innkeeper Solstice.”
Selys whispered in a panicked voice to Krshia and Erin.
“What are they doing? They shouldn’t be here! Someone should call the Watch!”
Krshia nudged Selys hard.
“Silence. Listen.”
The Worker continued.
“These ones wish for the Innkeeper Solstice to heal from wounds received. These ones express their regret for her suffering.”
Erin stared at him stupidly.
“Why?”
The leading Worker appeared confused.
“It is part of custom. These ones are taught to express regret/sadness/loss for death.”
“But I didn’t die. What about Klbkch? What about your—friend. The other Worker? He died protecting me.”
The Worker paused, and then shook his head.
“The Prognugator carried out his duties. The Worker died carrying out his duties. No mourning is necessary for broken shells and dead individuals. These ones merely express regret of individual Klbkch’s failure to protect.”
Erin stared at him.
“So you’re saying you’re sorry I got hurt?”
“These ones express regret for the failure of the Prognugator to protect the Innkeeper Solstice.”
“It wasn’t failure. Don’t—don’t say that.”
The Worker bowed his head again.
“This one offers apologies for its mistake.”
“Can’t you feel sorry? For Klbkch? And your friend?”
“This one apologizes. But this one cannot. These ones offer regret to the Innkeeper Solstice.”
Erin waited. But the Worker just kept its head bowed.
“Is that it?”
“Yes. These ones will disperse to assigned duties. Forgive these ones for disturbing the Innkeeper Solstice and others.”
As one, the Workers turned. Erin hesitated.
“Wait.”
They stopped, and turned back to her. She paused, and closed her eyes. Erin took a deep breath, and then looked at the Worker.
“…Come to my inn. I’ll feed you, and you can play chess with me.”
“What? Erin!”
Selys grabbed for her, but Erin was moving. She reached out and touched the lead Worker on the shoulder. He went very still.
“You said you’re sorry? I’m sorry. It was my fault Klbkch and the other Worker died. And that’s a bad thing. Even if you can’t understand it, I want to do something. Let me help you. Somehow.”
The Worker hesitated.
“These ones are not permitted to leave the city or move about without permission.”
“Why not?”
“These ones are not suitable for independent action. These ones must not be unaccompanied.”
“I’ll accompany you. Just—come with me. Please? It doesn’t have to be all of you. What about just you? What’s your name?”
The Worker went deathly still. All the Workers did. Erin looked at them curiously. Selys gasped and ran forward.
“Erin!”
She grabbed the human’s shoulder urgently. Selys whispered loudly in Erin’s ear.
“You never ask them what their names are! They don’t have any!”
“Why not?”
The Worker shuddered and looked at Erin. Selys raised one hand as her tail thrashed wildly.
“They just don’t!”
“This one has no name. This one is not important. This one is not an individual.”
“You could be.”
“Erin!”
This time Selys tried to grab Erin and drag her away. Erin fought her hands off.
“Why? What’s wrong?”
She poked the Worker in the chest.
“You’re an individual. You’re you. And the Worker who died? He was someone. Klbkch was someone. You’re all important, and that means when one of you dies it’s a bad thing.”
The Worker shook his head as the other Workers around him backed away.
“This one is not an individual. This one cannot be.”
“You are. Can’t you understand? You’re all special.”
