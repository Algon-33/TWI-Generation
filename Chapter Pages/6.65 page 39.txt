“On your feet, soldier!”
“Not—I got bit.”
The Drake’s body was covered in deep lacerations. He was bleeding, but green and yellow ran with the blood. Poison. The potion Erin had used on him hadn’t worked.
Embria stared at him, wide-eyed. She turned and bellowed.
“[Healer]! Sergeant Tilk! Creler poison! Get over here now!”
Erin stumbled towards Relc. But a Gnoll shoved her aside. The [Healer] ran as Embria turned. The waves of Crelers pouring out of the inn didn’t stop! All of them were coming through the door!
“What happened? Where are they coming from?”
The [Innkeeper] looked around. She knew the answers as soon as she asked. She spotted adventurers, Silver-rank, collapsed outside the gates. All of them were wounded. But there weren’t enough. Less than a third who’d gone through were back. Most of the road crew was alive. Reikhle was babbling as Olesm pointed.
“They came out of the Bloodfields! Thousands! We barely escaped—”
“[Attack Formation]! Hold that line! Embria, advance!”
Olesm bellowed. The Watch was forming a line as the walls unleashed their spells on the Crelers. The huge Crelers were being brought down as Embria and the high-level [Soldiers] aimed at them. The small Crelers died to swords, arrows, maces—even boots. But they died hard. And Gnolls and Drakes were screaming as the Crelers bit straight through steel!
“We didn’t see it. They just appeared—”
A female adventurer was babbling as Olesm turned to her. The [Strategist] was swearing.
“I don’t care! How many? An Adult? We need to sound the alarm in Pallass! [Rapid Retreat]! Pull back on the flank!”
“The Horns? Where are the Horns of Hammerad?”
Erin called out. She saw Lyonette and Mrsha, tending to Numbtongue. The Hobgoblin was on the ground. The [Princess] was shouting for one of the [Healers].
“They’re still out there.”
A voice. Erin whirled, expecting to see—
It was Palt. He was bleeding. Creler bites had torn open his chest. The Centaur was half-collapsed. Ulinde was on his back. What was—Erin stared at the Selphid. Something had torn her half to pieces. And Beza—the Minotauress was silent.
“The Horns? There are adventurers out there?”
Olesm whirled. Palt was staring at Erin. The [Illusionist]’s voice was a whisper.
“We—we held as long as we could. I tried. I’m sorry. Isceil’s dead. It killed him. We fought—but we couldn’t hold out.”
“But it was minutes—”
“Ten minutes. You didn’t open the door for ten minutes!”
The female adventurer whirled on Erin, cursing. The [Innkeeper] looked at her.
“No. My [Dangersense]—I checked the door not a minute after it went off—”
“We were there! We sent [Messages]! But you didn’t open the door!”
“I didn’t know.”
Erin whispered. Palt looked around, vaguely. He was shaking.
“They stayed behind to buy us time. They were trying to retreat. But there were too many Crelers! Hundreds! Baby Crelers and Juvenile ones—and an Adult. An Adult Creler.”
Olesm looked at Palt. He stared at the inn. So did Erin. The Crelers were slowing in coming out. But they were still coming. Dying. She looked at Relc, trying to move. Seborn and Moore, downed. Numbtongue.
Something in her head began counting.
“How long…?”
Ten minutes ago. Plus nine of fighting. Nine? About right. Erin stared at the Watch, holding the Crelers back.
Nineteen minutes.

Grimalkin of Pallass folded his arms. He stared at the breathless, wide-eyed Drassi as his students paused on their third lap around the city.
“No.”
“What?”
The [Gossip] clutched at a stitch in her side. She’d raced across the city, looking for him. The [Sinew Magus] shook his head.
