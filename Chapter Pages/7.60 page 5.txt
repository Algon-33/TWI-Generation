The bows which had slain Loren trained on the boy. He halted. And Mire spoke at last.
“Enough! Don’t kill him!”
“Exit with your arms raised.”
The [Assassin] did. Her arm, actually. The [Commander] stared at her.
“That’s her. [Assassin]! Drop your gear on the ground! [Mages]—”
They were checking her, appraising her to make sure she had no secret weapons. Bitterly, Mire tossed her potion, her belt, her bag of holding, secret blades on the ground.
Her son, her daughters, stared at her. The illusion ended. The [Assassin] laughed.
“You’ve taken it all from me. I surrender. Just—just let them live and I’ll tell you everything.”
“Secure her.”
The [Commander] didn’t take his burning eyes off Mire. [Soldiers]—Veltras’ best—dragged her down, securing her in cuffs that blocked both Skills and magic. Relics in their own right. Mire bared her teeth as they shackled her legs; hard to do with one arm.
“Mother!”
“Keep them back. Mire the Alchemist. You have made an attempt on the lives of multiple members of the Five Families. What say you, if anything?”
They forced her face into the dirt. Mire spat up at them.
“I’m an [Assassin]. I had my orders. You’re a [Soldier]. Listen, I know all the Faces, and the Guild’s locations—”
“I’m sure you do. My duty, however, is clear. For your crimes, the House of Veltras judges you guilty. By admission. By witness. By magic. That is enough. The sentence is death. Execute her.”
“Wh—no! I have information!”
Mire had not been expecting that. She’d been prepared to bargain it all away. There was a cry from the manor.
“Keep the children back. No—lock them inside. Away from the windows.”
The [Commander] glanced over Mire’s shoulder. Mire struggled then, trying to throw the arms off. Break the grips—fight barehanded.
“Sword.”
The [Commander] dismounted. Mire cursed, screaming. There were voices from behind her. Arguing, begging, pleading. One of the [Soldiers] cried out as the youngest daughter shoved him aside. The children raced past the guards. It couldn’t be true. Even now—
Mire looked up as the sword swung down. Her head rolled. The [Commander] wiped the blade and handed it to the [Soldier].
“Target neutralized. To the next. You—you. Ensure the children are managed until Lord Veltras decides their fate.”
Such was House Veltras’ justice.

The hatred of it—it was almost funny. Look how efficiently vicious they were when you roused them to it.
House Veltras, and its prideful [Lord]. If only they were this ruthless to begin with, it would have never come to that.
You couldn’t have threatened Magnolia Reinhart the same way you did Lord Tyrion. But now he’d found his wrath.
“We were close. I had my hand on his throat. I could have killed them. I was more powerful than the leader of one of the Five Families.”
She mumbled. Not sure if the words were actually coming out of her lips. She felt odd. Naked.
Her mask was gone. That was worse than the lack of her gear. Her mask.
The [Toxins Expert] had wondered why she wasn’t dead when she first woke up. But the answer was obvious.
To her disappointment, it was not Lord Tyrion Veltras who descended the steps into this small place. But it made a lot of sense. The [Assassin] mumbled.
“Am I in the Veltras Manor?”
“I would not suffer your presence. Nor would Ullim. Your companions are dead. Your Guild is burning, [Assassin]. The cure has been delivered. All your plans have come to naught.”
