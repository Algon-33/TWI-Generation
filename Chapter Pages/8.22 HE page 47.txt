Erin looked up with Califor, Xarkouth, and the others. She saw the Giant point with one finger as he held his other arm still.
He hadn’t grown tired. But the Giant had…
Shivered. Why? Erin turned, and her phantom heart would have skipped a beat if it beat at all.
The lost one. It was…
It was smiling at them. Smiling without lips. Without a face. As clear as the sunlight streaming down, Erin realized something.
It had just had an idea. It slowly backed away, and the ghosts watched as it vanished into the distance. They looked at each other. Then…got back to work.
The sun shone down, briefly. While it did, the girl sat with the dead. For as long as it lasted, then…
They told her their stories.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Notes: I’m back! I have gotten all my vaccine shots and let me tell you…that one update off?
Not restful. Shivers, lightheadedness, and exceptional, I mean, amazing arm pain! Well, it’s done with now, but I still get my monthly mid-break! That…was an unpleasant few days.
However, I’m back to writing and whilst they didn’t win, the Horns took 2nd (I think?), and so I wrote this chapter combining plot elements. If they’d won, you’d get Pisces next chapter.
Instead, it’s Relc! Probably next chapter? We’ll see—I’m back to work, so let’s get to it! I write, you read. You also pay me, so I guess I don’t get to complain? But I love complaining. Thanks for reading and see you next chapter!
