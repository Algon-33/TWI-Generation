“Sure. Will anyone play with us?”
Selys looked around. She caught the eye of a Centaur, moodily smoking near an open window.
“Palt. Do you want to…”
“No.”
The Centaur glanced up. Normally, Palt was affable as could be. Right now? He gave the deck of cards a dark look. Selys blinked. She looked at Erin, whom she was fairly certain Palt liked. Erin wore a guilty expression.
“Anyone else? Montressa? Beza?”
“I will not play with her.”
The Minotauress folded her arms. Selys looked around.
“…Bird?”
“No! I am not playing! You cannot have my birds!”
The Worker shouted. He was possessively clutching his boiled eggs to him as he had lunch. Selys looked at Erin and raised one brow.
“What did you do, Erin?”
“Nothing! I was just playing—and I kept winning—”
“Miss Erin has an unusual gift for playing cards. Which in turn takes away from our enjoyment of the game.”
Palt explained as he blew a smoke ring out the window. Erin blushed as Selys looked at her.
“Well…”
“Apparently it’s known as ‘counting outs’. And Erin can do it in her head.”
Montressa was counting the coins she had left. Erin had returned some of the money, but she’d swept the table too many times for anyone else to be happy. She’d even won two birds off of Bird.
“You never told me you’re a [Gambler], Erin.”
Selys was surprised. Erin shook her head instantly.
“What? Psh. I don’t gamble. I thought you all liked to play!”
She pointed accusatorially at the Wistram [Mages]. All three looked quite put out.
“We like to play fair games, Erin.”
Montressa shot back. Erin turned red.
“What? All three of you were cheating! You used magic to see my hand!”
“That’s how you play in Wistram! And it didn’t help because you figured it out each time we tried! You—you’re using calculations to win! That’s not fair!”
“It’s just math! Odds! Probability! It’s easy! And you have to not show people what you’re really thinking.”
“So says the board game expert.”
Selys rolled her eyes. Of course Erin was good at games like this. She could be surprisingly competitive and when she learned a game, she learned it. Especially how to win. And her poker face? Erin’s poker face? It was probably unbeatable.
“So, do you want to play, Selys? Or—I know! Why don’t you check out my garden? I was planting stuff with the others all day.”
“I…”
Selys glanced at the cards and table. And at the Garden of Sanctuary. And she realized she didn’t really want to do either. Perhaps it was that, or Drassi’s nettling comment that made Selys look back the way she’d come.
“You know, Erin? I was sort of wondering. Is the door to Pallass open? I…might want to visit again.”
Erin Solstice blinked. She looked at Selys. And then she smiled.
“Yeah. And the grass has it fully charged up so it’s easy…easier. Lyonette wants to charge people. But if we go now, she doesn’t have to know…”
“I can pay—”
The [Heiress] saw Drassi roll her eyes. Erin laughed as she led Selys down the passage to the door. She waited as a group of Humans came through.
“You coming for the inn?”
“Uh? No, Miss. We’re here to work, actually.”
A small group of women and men hurriedly bowed to Erin, some removing their caps. Erin smiled.
“Really? Where are you from? Wait—Esthelm?”
“We’ve got day-jobs in Liscor.”
“Oh—then let me put you through. One sec, Selys…”
The Drake watched as the Human disappeared. Liscor was changing a lot. Selys looked at Erin, in her [Innkeeper]’s work clothing, a bit dirty from gardening and newly dried from her pond bath.
