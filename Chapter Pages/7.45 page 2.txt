Ryoka could imagine ten thousand scenarios where something in Valeterisa’s trapped mansion caught up with Fierre. But…why not Ryoka as well? It made no sense.
She was panicking, Ryoka knew. She slapped her cheeks.
The facts. Stick to the facts, you idiot. And the facts were—Fierre was sick. She had been cured. And now she was sick.
Something had made her unwell. Find what that was. Ryoka stood up. She looked around, meeting their eyes. Colfa and Himilt’s last.
“I didn’t do this. At least, not on purpose. I was sure what I gave Fierre would help. If I’m wrong, I’ll pay for it. But I don’t think I am. I think something happened to Fierre, when she got here or just before. We need to find out what that is. Cure Fierre, if possible. Have you given her a potion?”
“That was the first thing we tried! I bought what I could in Reizmelt—there are some [Healer]’s remedies that help us.”
“Okay. Okay. Then—can you show me where Fierre was? What she ate and what she did, step by step?”
“Why?”
Rivel glared at Ryoka. The young woman gave him an odd look.
“I need to see exactly what Fierre did. Each and every thing! Any one of those things could be the culprit here.”
It was a logical, orderly way of looking at the problem. Rivel hesitated and Himilt nodded. His eyes focused on Ryoka, searching her like the first time they had met.
“We can do that. I’ll show you around. Bamer—help Colfa. Anything you know, any old stories. Rivel, you stay with Fierre.”
“I still think it’s this ‘cure’. How are you so certain? Do you know what was in this potion?”
It was fair to ask. Ryoka felt flushed, as she looked down at Fierre.
“No. But I am certain.”
“Then who made it? What grade of potion was it? If you have no idea, how can you be so sure? Fierre is a—a Vampire. Not a Human.”
“I know that! But the person who gave it to me was certain it would cure anyone. He gave me a panacea. A relic-class potion. He—it was a Grand Mage of Wistram.”
The others traded looks. Colfa inhaled and exhaled as her eyes flickered.
“How do you kn—would that even—why d—baaaah.”
The ‘baaah’ made Ryoka jump. It hadn’t actually come from Colfa. Rather—just behind her and lower to the ground.
A sheep had wandered into Fierre’s room. A familiar sheep with a luxurious coat.
“Fluffles? Get out! This isn’t the time!”
Ryoka stared at the sheep as Colfa pointed. She forgot that Fierre’s family really were good, local farmers. And that their livestock had a habit of wandering indoors.
Fluffles the Sixth baahed until Colfa pushed him out of the room with her foot. She turned back to Ryoka, but Fluffles had reminded everyone.
“Be sure. I need to mix up a tonic. It—be sure! Himilt, deal with the Human. Bamer, come with me!”
She swept out of the room. Ryoka heard another baaah as the sheep was carried away. She turned to Himilt.
“I—let’s go. I need to know what Fierre did.”
“Are you sure her sickness came from here?”
The father looked at Ryoka. She didn’t.
“No. I need to make a list of everything Fierre did. She was almost never out of sight—we even slept in the same carriage. The carriage, damn. And the island…I’ll make a list. I have paper—no—”
Ryoka cursed again. No paper or quills or ink in her bag of holding! She’d tossed everything out to make room for the magical items she’d taken from Valeterisa’s mansion. The Vampire farmer shook his head.
“We have paper and ink. Come with me. Rivel—shout if Fierre gets worse.”
The two strode from the room. Ryoka was taking deep breaths. Focus. Write it all down. Be logical about this. It’s not bad. She’s just feverish. She’s going to be okay. Focus—
