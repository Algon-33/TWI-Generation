“Farmstead looks untouched. I don’t know. 4th, 1st—I think we’re made. Fall back?”
“Not without taking revenge! The Scalespeaker will have all our tails! We’re approaching the inn! W—”
“1st Squad under attack! Under—”
The [Ambush Captain] heard shouting through their link.
“City Watch! Surrender!”
“Contact! Fall back! F—aaah! AAAAH!”
The scream came from 2nd Squad. The [Ambush Captain] shouted through his Skill.
“What is it? What is it?”
“Anti—”
Then silence. The [Ambush Captain] tried again as his Drake [Elite Skirmishers] stopped, staring nervously at their leader.
“1st Squad, fall back! 2nd, where are you? Do you need reinforcements? 3rd? Is anyone there at all?”
“Captain. I think—this was a bad idea.”
One of the Drakes whispered. The [Ambush Captain] was shaking.
“We can’t leave without firing a single shot! Our city’s pride—we’re undetected. The others were just sloppy. Let’s…”
He focused on the building closest to them.
“The inn. We’ll sack the inn and go. Move up the hill!”
The Drakes surged out of their cover, their camouflaged cloaks rippling in the wind. They had the element of surprise! The Watch was occupied, and the Antinium were too!
“For Hectval! K—”
An arrow sprouted out of one of the Drake’s heads. He dropped as the [Ambush Captain] began to shout.
“Archer! Take cover!”
They screamed—and another Drake raised his crossbow only to have an arrow appear in his throat. The [Ambush Captain] stared in horror up at the inn. And the figure shooting down the hill. He recognized, with horror, the legendary Antinium that had climbed onto Pallass’ walls. No. Why here?
Bird the—

The Wandering Inn’s lower floors were in chaos. Lyonette had all the guests far from the doors and Todi’s elites had manned the kill-zone. So had the inn’s staff—Silveran had two crossbows trained on the door. The [Princess] though, was worried.
“Mrsha, stay in the [Garden]! No one goes out until Zevara takes care of it! Bird! Don’t attack them! Bird! Stop killing them! They might not be enemies!”
This could be a diplomatic incident! Belgrade had gone off and attacked one of the patrols! Lyonette was tearing at her hair. But the worst offender was—
“Numbtongue, stop!”
He and Badarrow halted as they went for the doors. Snapjaw was rolling her eyes. But the two were glaring at each other.
“I get five first.”
“Pssh. Bow.”
The two shoved at each other. Lyonette ran over as Mrsha peeked out of the [Garden]. A worried Moore pulled her to safety.
“Are you two competing? Don’t be idiots!”
“Bird will kill all of them. Our turn.”
The [Bard] had the Dragonblood Crystal sword and his guitar on his back. Lyonette shook her head.
“Absolutely not. Numbtongue! Come back! Don’t—argh!”
He ignored her. The Hobgoblin bounded for the door as Badarrow surged up the stairs.

Death! Niers howled as he cut at the air. The two adventurers were hesitating. He taunted them. Which one would come first? He spat another bit of blood out of his mouth.
“I’m not old yet! Let’s see if you can slay the Titan, you little insects! Come on!”
He brandished his sword. The taunting worked at last. The adventurer captain surged forwards with a roar, bringing his mace up to hammer the little target down.
As if Fraerlings stood still. Niers spun to meet him as the [Mage] belatedly ran flat-footed towards him on the left. He leapt forwards.
Idiots. They’d forgotten his boots.
“Hop!”
He shot upwards. The adventurer recoiled, but he was fast.
“[Scythe’s Arc]!”
He screamed. Niers grinned. He pointed at the man.
“[R—”
