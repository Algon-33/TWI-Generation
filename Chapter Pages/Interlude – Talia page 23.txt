Interlude – Talia

The Goblin Slayer pointed, through the trees to the base of the hills. Ser Thornst frowned.
“You tracked them?”
“Here. And there.”
“Let me see.”
One of the other [Spring Knights] who had a tracking Skill moved forwards. He squatted by the body and studied the tracks in the ground. It was all dirt to Talia, but he seemed to agree. As he noted the stiffness of the Goblin corpse, Talia stepped back with Chise, Thornst, and Lorell to confer. The senior [Summer Knights] eyed the Goblin Slayer. He was watching them all.
“What an odd warrior. Not a [Knight], clearly. But he has the armor of one. That’s good steel. New. Quite mobile as well.”
Ser Thornst nodded to the Goblin Slayer’s armor. Indeed, he wore light armor, not as heavy as some of the [Knights], but it covered his body, allowing for superior movement. Talia knew a well-fitted suit of armor was like a second skin. A trained [Knight] could run, jump, swim, and climb in it with ease. Ser Lorell frowned darkly.
“He seems to match the description of this ‘Goblin Slayer’. I did hear a rumor of him on the road earlier. But he did not state he was such. An imposter, perhaps?”
“His armor is meticulously maintained, for all of the smell. They’re not all one set, though.”
Dame Chise studied the armored figure. Talia agreed. The armor was good beneath the dirt. Ser Lorell pursed his lips.
“He seems to be pursuing the Goblins. Should we insist on taking precedence?”
“Would he agree? This isn’t Terandria, Ser Lorell.”
“Nevertheless, we are nineteen.”
“If he’s an adventurer, he might object…”
“I’ll speak to him. Perhaps he can tell us more.”
Talia backed out of the conversation and moved over to the Goblin Slayer. He was speaking to the [Spring Knight]. Ser Shait was speaking.
“I count a large group. I’d say…fifty? More? Moving in the direction of the hills, indeed. That squares with the thirty-some Ogres. The Goblins…”
“Twenty five. Males and females. No Hobs. Few Goblins are with the Ogres.”
The Goblin Slayer’s voice made the [Knights] look up. Ser Eldein blinked.
“You can count so accurately, sir?”
The helmeted head moved towards him.
“I know Goblins. Twenty five.”
A specialized class for hunting Goblins, perhaps. Talia had met [Hunters] like the [Witch Hunters] who were like that. She had never met one that killed just Goblins. She studied the silent figure as Ser Eldein paused.
“No Hobs? Ah, Hobgoblins. Is that unusual, Sir Slayer?”
She squatted down next to the Goblin Slayer, steeling her stomach against the smell of the body. It had yet to truly stink. The Goblin Slayer paused.
“Hobs rarely appear in slave tribes. Goblins move too slow for Ogres. Tracks also show the same.”
“Slave tribes?”
“Yes. This is one. Goblins obey larger monsters. Twenty five for fighting came this way. Thirty Ogres. This one was one of them.”
“Why did it die? An accident? Its head looks—”
“Crushed. Ogre club.”
The Goblin Slayer dispassionately pointed. Talia nodded. Even she could read that much.
“And you’re sure of the count?”
“Fifteen female. Ten male.”
“More female than male?”
Ser Thornst had come over. He frowned. For answer, the Goblin Slayer pulled at the dead Goblin’s loincloth. The [Knights] recoiled.
“Sir Slayer!”
“Look. Female.”
Talia averted her gaze.
“That is unseemly.”
“The Goblin’s dead. Angered the Ogres. Probably.”
