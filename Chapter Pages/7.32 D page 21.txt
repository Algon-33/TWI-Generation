[Geneva] – Thank you, again. I’m doing the best I can. Honestly, I have enough resources. But the Yellow Rivers disease is spreading.
[Joseph] – I’ve seen it in the news. It’s not where I am yet, but it looks bad. What can be done?
[Geneva] – We need a cure. But there are no antibiotics in this world that I know of. Do you know any [Alchemists]?
[Joseph] – Yes. I know a high-level one. Antibiotics? Do you mean, like, penicillin?
[Geneva] – Yes! If you have come across any supplements or substances with similar properties, we need it urgently where I am.
[Joseph] – We have penicillin. How much do you need?
[Geneva] – What? Say again?
[Joseph] – We have penicillin. An [Alchemist] I know made it for me. Also, baking soda. And matches. Do you need some for this Yellow Rivers thing?
[Joseph] – …Hello?
[Joseph] – Are you still there?
 
Chaos in the United Nations headquarters. Some of the others knocked on the door to ask what the screaming was about. Daly nearly knocked Dawson flat.
“Dawson! We’ve found fucking penicillin!”
“What? What?”
“Shut up! Everyone shut up!”
Paige was shouting. Kirana looked around, and then clapped her hands.
The miniature shockwave turned the noise into silence. The [Housekeeper] looked at Geneva. The [Doctor] was pale-faced.
 
[Geneva] – Please confirm. You have penicillin? How?
[Joseph] – I asked one of my [Alchemist] friends to research it months ago. A friend of mine…was sick. It wasn’t ready then. Now, it is. Do you need it?
[Geneva] – Yes. The Yellow Rivers disease is a bacteria. We need as much as possible. It may halt this pandemic. We need it.
[Joseph] – Okay.
 
“How do we get the stuff? It’s in Izril?”
“Ships. How long will that take?”
Siri was conferring with Luan. He was grimacing over a map.
“At least…”
 
[Geneva] – If possible, we need it sent to us at all speed. I know it is difficult, but we are aware it is possible to teleport small items.
[Joseph] – Yes. Okay.
[Geneva] – However, we need as much as possible. And the methods of creating more. Written instructions as well as large a supply to cultivate more. Assuming this is a mold? I am sorry, but if possible, we need a Courier. We will attempt to send as much gold as needed. We are calculating how much we can send you.
[Joseph] – Okay. I will have it sent by Courier today.
[Geneva] – What? Please clarify?
[Joseph] – I will arrange it by Courier. Don’t worry. I can do it. What else do you need?
 
And there was silence. Erin Solstice sat there. Lyonette was pale-faced from the thought of hiring a Courier. But she looked at Erin. Mrsha stared up, peering at Erin’s face. Bird smiled. So did Numbtongue.
Her eyes were focused. She was just sitting there. But the air was charged.
 
[Geneva] – If you can, we need to see how effective this penicillin-substitute is for the Yellow Rivers disease.
[Joseph] – I see. I can arrange that too. What else? They say they’ve found a cure in Pallass, though.
[Geneva] – That is incorrect. The crystals are not a workable solution. This [Healer] has not dealt with enough patients and those ‘cured’ may still be carriers. She has treated six patients and her crystals cannot be bought or produced in enough numbers. This penicillin-substitute is a better option. Are you sure it is penicillin?
 
Erin felt a moment of panic. But Ryoka had gone over it with Octavia.
 
[Joseph] – Fairly sure. It was tested. Okay. Understood.
[Geneva] – Can you send the penicillin?
[Joseph] – I will. Please wait for me to send a response confirming. But I will get it to you as fast as possible. Trust me.
[Geneva] – Thank you.
 
“Thank you.”
