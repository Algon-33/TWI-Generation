“I know. It must have been bad if you curled up like that. I should have gone after you instead of letting you leave. Want to talk about it?”
Silently, the Worker nodded. He hugged his knees as he sat with Erin. She waited for him to speak. It was so…reassuring to look at her. After a while, Pawn felt like the words were ready to come out.
“I hurt Lyonette.”
“Yep.”
“…Is she alright now?”
Erin shrugged.
“I gave her the day off. She went to Celum for a while with Mrsha. Today she was good. Upset, but she wanted to do her job. And I think she’s not angry at you. Much. But she is still upset about what you said.”
“That is good. Good. Not what I said. But good that she is better. I didn’t mean to—it was not my intention. Does she know that?”
Pawn looked down. He felt very small. Erin watched him for a while.
“I didn’t ask. I’m sure she understands you wanted to help. But that’s the problem, isn’t it? You tried to help her and she didn’t want it.”
Pawn nodded mechanically. He looked up at Erin, hesitated.
“Do you know what we were talking about?”
“I heard the shouted bits. And I got the rest from context.”
Erin smiled slightly. She looked pensive for a moment and then glanced at Pawn.
“I know she’s a [Princess]. That’s what it was all about, right? Did something happen to her class?”
“Yes. She lost it. I was trying to help her get it back. I didn’t think it was right that she lost it. But when I tried to pray—I—”
Pawn broke off, shaking his head.
“She lost it? Really? She didn’t tell me that!”
Both of Erin’s brows shot up. Pawn looked at her, surprised.
“You did not know? She didn’t tell you?”
The young woman shook her head.
“She told me she lost something. Not what. And I know she was a princess, but I don’t know if she ever told me herself. Ryoka definitely told me…um, I forget.”
Frowning, Erin tilted her head. After a while she gave up and shrugged.
“It doesn’t matter, I guess. Lyonette didn’t need to tell me anything. She told you, though. And you were worried, weren’t you? You tried to help her get it back.”
“Yes. And now she hates me. Because I did not respect her wishes.”
The Worker grabbed his knees and rocked back and forth. Erin watched him, concerned. She stopped Pawn with one hand and patted his knee gently.
“Hmm. I don’t know if she hates you. I think you went too far.”
Pawn looked at her, feeling a shred of hope.
“Really?”
Erin nodded.
“I know you don’t understand being social, Pawn. Lyonette understands that too. I think she feels bad about shouting at you. But—how can I explain this? You did do something bad. Just a tiny bit.”
She paused, biting her lip softly and trying to find the best words. Pawn waited. He ached. At last, Erin went on.
“We want to be talked to. We want to be cared about. But sometimes we also need to be alone. Some days we don’t want to talk to our friends. And that’s especially true of when we need to be alone.”
“But she was sad. I tried to help.”
Again, Erin nodded.
“And that was great. Really. Sometimes when you’re sad, you need to hug someone. But sometimes, some people just want to be alone. And that’s fine too. I think Lyonette liked you coming the first time. But after that? After you kept trying to check up on her? And change her? Pray for her to make her get her class back? That was too much.”
“But her class—”
“She lost it. It’s gone, Pawn. If she wanted to get it back, I think she would have asked. But she didn’t ask, did she?”
Pawn didn’t answer. Erin scooted a bit closer. Her hand was warm on his knee.
