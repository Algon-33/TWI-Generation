Interlude – The Revenant and the Naga
Page 31
Author’s Note: It’s a chapter below 20,000 words. What madness is this!?
Well, I was aiming for it. And this interlude was planned a long time in advance. I combined two perspectives rather than just go for the Seven Legends of Emir Yazdil, and I hope it was interesting!
But I took it easier since we’re winding down to the end of the month. There have been some long chapters, even with the two week break! One more and then I’m on my regular week off before February. The poll chapter awaits!
Until then, I hope you enjoy…you find this chapter interesting. It wasn’t the easiest to write, despite being short. But now you know. And knowing…probably isn’t a good thing all the time.
Thanks for reading! See you next chapter!
