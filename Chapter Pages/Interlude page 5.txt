Rags asked it as she looked at the others. At Redscar. At Snapjaw. After so much, they still looked to her? Redscar nodded. He half-smiled. Pain ran through him and her. But he still smiled.
“Who else could be Chieftain?”
Rags looked around. At Redscar. At the two Redfangs, Rabbiteater and Badarrow. At Snapjaw. Poisonbite. She shook her head. And then she stood tall.
The little Goblin climbed onto a rock. She stood in front of the Goblins. Thousands. They had lost their tribes. Their leaders. Their family and friends. The Humans had shattered them. The Drakes had pushed them away. They had been used again. Used and killed.
But still, they were here. And the living were here thanks to the dead. They looked up at the small Goblin. She took a breath of the cold air and looked past them. The sky was lightening. Dawn was not far away. Rags closed her eyes. Then she drew her sword. The Goblins below her did the same.
Their weapons were heavy. Blood stained. But as they raised them, flames burst into life. Their weapons ignited, and the fire burned in the darkness. Candles for the fallen. Rags held her flaming blade aloft and looked at them. Her people. She shouted down at them.
“I am Rags! Chieftain of the Flooded Water tribe! Chieftain of the Redfangs! Chieftain of Reiss’ Goblins! Chieftain of the Cave Goblins! Great Chieftain of the Mountain! Follow me.”
And they did. The Goblins limped after the small Goblin. They supported each other. They wept and mourned, but they did follow. Their eyes fixed on the small Goblin’s back. Was she a bit taller than before? Surely. A tiny bit. She seemed taller. Still a child. But taller.
She walked ahead of them as the sun rose. It was cold. And she was so tired. But still Rags walked. The light shone down on her body and she shaded her eyes. And she led them forwards.
Into tomorrow.

They found him as dawn shone down on the battlefield. Only when Tyrion Veltras’ army had left the Floodplains did the gates of Liscor open. Oh, some Humans still remained on the field, but the army had gone. That left only the Goblin dead.
And the Antinium. They lay in a neat row. A hundred and one bodies. Fragments, really. The Painted Soldiers had died as Antinium do. Hard. They had fought to the last. He knelt before them as they approached him.
“Pawn? Pawn!”
Lyonette rushed towards the Worker. He was motionless. She called out and the other searching Antinium made a beeline towards him. Belgrade, Anand—and Klbkch. The Revalantor was riding a horse of all things. He dismounted and the horse shifted uneasily. But it was too well-trained to move.
“Pawn. Are you—are you okay?”
The Worker didn’t move. He knelt in front of the Painted Soldiers. In front of a Soldier with yellow spatters of paint.
“They’re all dead.”
“They fought well.”
That was all Klbkch said as he dismounted. Lyonette looked up, her eyes flashing, but Klbkch just strode past her. He surveyed the dead as Anand and Belgrade approached. They had an escort of Painted Soldiers. They stopped in front of the bodies.
“All of them?”
Belgrade stared at the fallen. Anand shook his head.
“It was statistically unlikely they would survive. The fact that Pawn did is nothing short of a—”
He broke off. Pawn hadn’t moved. His antennae was broken. He was broken. Klbkch stared down at him. Then he glanced at the body.
“Yellow Splatters is dead.”
Pawn jerked. Lyonette glared up at Klbkch.
“Be quiet! Can’t you be kind? Can’t you be sorry for them? Pawn just lost—”
“They were under his command. Pawn led them. They fell. They fulfilled their duties.”
