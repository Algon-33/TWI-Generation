He didn’t know. He didn’t know. He thought he knew, but there was nothing in this world that was sure. Nothing that was true. So Toren had come here, to find the one thing he could believe.
To know.
For a long time, the two just looked at each other. The young woman, seated, breathing quicker. Eyes wide. The skeleton, alive in undeath.
Their history played before them. Toren remembered it all. Waking. First becoming him, obeying orders. Struggling with her orders.
Leveling. Finding joy in it. Finding joy in killing. Growing. Hating her orders.
A song.
An exploding inn.
Lyonette. Mrsha. Snow.
The sleigh.
And then—Esthelm. The Goblins. Her…death.
The dungeon. Hearing her name.
And back to here. Toren didn’t know what Erin thought as she looked at him. But he remembered it all so clearly. So clearly—and yet the Toren of old was a stranger to him.
A foolish skeleton, who understood nothing. Who took pleasure in simple leveling, in fighting. Who knew nothing of—pain. Of regret.
Because Toren regretted killing Erin. It had torn at him. He had lost the pleasure he took from killing, from leveling itself! He had become she. And she had tried to show him something.
But it turned out he and she had been wrong. Because Erin had never died.
She tried to kill him.
Or perhaps not. The skeleton waited. He was alone. The sword he’d stabbed Bevussa with hung at his hip. A worn shield lay on his back. He had torn away the clothes she wore, left them, and the mask in the kitchen. Erin was…unarmed? She had a knife on the belt at her side. Two potions.
A golden ring on one hand. It looked strange to Toren. Gold, then bronze. Magic flickered.
Toren didn’t move. He was waiting for Erin. He would wait forever, if need be. Now, in this moment, he was afraid. Relieved. Furious. Happy. Something…else. So many emotions, but balanced perfectly together, waiting for the uncertain future.
Anything could happen. And Toren didn’t know what came next. He had no idea. He waited for Erin to do something. She might attack. Flee. Question. Her head might explode. She could just go back to sleep.
She might even hug him—
Toren waited. And at last, Erin stood up.
“Toren.”
He jerked at his name. Erin smiled. She spread her arms.
“It’s so…good to see you, Toren! Are you okay? I thought you got lost when I told you to carry me in the sled—”
Toren smiled. But then—he heard a sound in his skull. He twitched.
Ding. The sleigh bells. He remembered them. He remembered everything. He remembered why he had hated her.
No. Wait. Erin was looking at him. She’d paused when he moved. Her voice was cheerful, bright. She gestured around the inn.
“I…I’m so glad you’re back! The inn’s a bit of a mess. But it wasn’t your fault this time! It was Crelers! Hey—why don’t you grab a broom, or help me clean up? I’ll just go look for one—”
Clean up? Hey, Toren! Clean the rooms! Hey Toren, get me some water! 
Hey, Toren!
The skeleton stared. That wasn’t it either. Erin paused as his arms dropped. She stared at him. And he stared back.
Waiting.
“Doesn’t look like there’s a dust rag around here. I’m just going to…”
The door. She was edging towards the door. Then one of the holes in the walls, closer. Toren walked forwards. Erin halted.
“Toren?”
He walked around the table. Blocking the way she’d come. Erin’s eyes flicked towards him. And then the opening. She looked around. Toren stared at her. Erin looked back. And he saw it.
Something in the eyes. More than fear. More than surprise. Something—the skeleton hesitated.
“It’s so good to see you.”
