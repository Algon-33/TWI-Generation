Maybe Klbkch just needed to cool down. Normally, Relc would suggest a drink. Or a visit to a brothel. Neither really was working out so he decided to drop it.
After some thought, Relc decided not to let Klbkch in on the big, amazing thing he was part of. Not that he didn’t want to do right by Klbkch. But making a bit of coin on the side didn’t seem to be the Antinium’s highest priority.
“Our break ends in ten minutes. We will return to the barracks now. I am going to visit The Wandering Inn. Erin Solstice has invited me. I will listen to her. Perhaps she can allay my…reservations.”
That was all Klbkch said. He sounded more stable at that. But he liked Erin. They both did. Relc nodded, relieved.
“Hey, Klb, great idea. I’m going there myself. I’ll see you there, huh?”
“Perhaps.”
Klbkch marched off with Relc towards the barracks. The Drake exhaled. It was coming to evening. Problem solved! Klbkch would get to Erin, cool down, and maybe stop being so tense. Relc was trying, but it was hard being as considerate as he was.
The former [Sergeant] stretched as he signed off work. He didn’t have a night patrol. He looked at the [Guardswoman] on duty.
“Hey, Beilmark. You wanna hear how to make more coin?”
The Gnoll Senior Guardswoman looked up.
“Relc. You pitched your stupid thing to me yesterday on patrol. I’m not interested. It sounds like too much work.”
“What? Nah. You get returns! Hey, you were all with me on handing out copies of the Antinium sex story.”
Relc kept his voice low. Still, Klbkch twitched as he stowed his gear. Beilmark eyed Klbkch.
“That was different. This isn’t interesting.”
“Fine. I’ll go find some people before I visit the inn. Erin says there are peach tarts. Mm.”
“Hm. There are. Miss Lyonette brought some to Watch Captain Zevara. They smelled good.”
“Really? Damn. I’d better hurry up!”
Relc hurried out of the Watch House. Normally, he’d be already at the inn. Klbkch was certainly striding that way. But today—Relc had another mission. And he’d never have partaken of any extra-curricular work, but this was a special case. This was money.
“Hey, Kelli. Kelli! You’re off-duty, right? Give me a minute—no, five. I’ve gotta show you something.”
A Drake [Guardswoman] going off-duty sighed as she turned to face the Drake [Guardsman]. She turned, resigned.
“Relc. If this is the Antinium sex thing, I laughed at that once. It gets old. What is it?”
“Not the sex thing, Kelli. This is actually good. For everyone! How would you like to make some coin?”
The [Guardswoman] raised her brows. She looked quickly at Relc. But he wasn’t the kind of [Guard] to pursue illegal activities. Not only did Zevara make her Watch swear on truth spell that they weren’t criminal each month (a tradition among Drake City Watches), Relc just…wasn’t that kind of Drake. Lazy, rude, thoughtless, but never criminal.
“…Okay. You have me interested. This had better not be anything stupid, though.”
“Nothing like that. I’m serious, Kelli. Listen—this is…hold on. I have a brochure.”
Relc dug around in his belt pouch. He came out with a folded, colored bit of paper.
“Okay, so the way it works is—you give me money—”
“Hah!”
“No, wait! You give me money, and I send the money to this organization. They’re funding high-level adventurers.”
Relc waved his claws. Kelli paused.
“Wait, what? You don’t keep the money?”
“No. And the best part is—you get the money back.”
“You’re making no sense.”
“Darn, I always get this part wrong. Let me explain. Here, read this. It says what I’m saying.”
