Solstice (Pt. 8)

“I enjoyed it. You have met your friend. Be well, Ryoka Griffin. If you ever come back here—visit me again. But I doubt it will be so.”
“Thank you.”
Tears sprang into Ryoka’s eyes. But Nama did not prolong the farewell. She gently touched Ryoka’s cheeks with her furry hands. Then turned.
“Kneel.”
Ivolethe whispered to Ryoka. The Wind Runner looked at her. Then she did, bowing her head. Ivolethe kept the bow. She looked at Ryoka as Nama walked back into the forest.
“You are luckier than I could have dreamed. To have met her.”
“She protected me from a giant. And—the Wild Hunt. And some of the lesser fae.”
“Aye. She could do that. You are lucky she was kindly.”
“Could she not be?”
The young woman felt a slight bit of unease in her chest. She gazed after Nama.
“She’s a Brownie, right? A type of…”
Ivolethe was staring at Ryoka. She shook her head slowly. Then narrowed her eyes.
“Ah. She’s fixed an image in your head. No Brownie could have held off the Wild Hunt. You silly…silly thing. Did you not ask yourself who could do that?”
“I…but she looks like…”
Exactly what she wanted Ryoka to see. She had never said she was a Brownie. Ivolethe nodded.
“What do you think I see?”
So saying, she reached out and touched Ryoka’s eyelids gently. And Ryoka looked up.
The forest of world trees rose higher than she could see, even if she craned back her head. Unimaginably vast.
The forest of the fae, where the Sword in the Stone rested. And all things could live there. Even—
“I chose the largest tree I could find. And it is still a bit too small.”
In the place where Nama had been, the vast trees shifted as something passed them by. Ryoka’s legs stopped working. Just as well she was kneeling.
“She lost her husband and her child.”
“Yes. No doubt she did. And she was still kind to you. Be grateful.”
Ivolethe bowed again. And then rose and took Ryoka’s hand. The young woman stared at her.
“This place is so wonderful. And horrible.”
“Would you have it any other way?”
She laughed at Ryoka. Then, Ivolethe pointed.
“Now we have thanked the one who matters. We will meet some of the others again. But it is time, Ryoka.”
“Time?”
Ryoka’s nerves hummed. She looked at Ivolethe. Yet her friend was just smiling.
“Yes. Time. Let us fly. I will show you the delights of my world.”
“But Ivolethe—I need your help. Erin—”
“Tell me about it.”
The faerie leapt into the air. Ryoka copied her, flying higher as the world disappeared below her. Ivolethe laughed, swooping around.
“Don’t fly like a straight line, fool! Fly like this!”
She dove corkscrewing about and pulling up out of the dive in a near-vertical climb. Like the Frost Faeries always flew. Ryoka tried to copy her. She shouted in delight and alarm.
“But Ivolethe!”
“Tell me your woes! I know some of them! But tell me! We have time!”
“We do?”
Ryoka slowed. The Frost Faerie drifted back to her, sitting on the air.
“We do. You have won the time. So let go, my dear friend, and tell me everything. You have been gone such a short time as we count such things. So why did I miss you?”
She mock-glared. And then seized Ryoka in an aerial hug again, swinging her down, then letting Ryoka fly across the sky. The young woman caught herself and flew back. She tackled Ivolethe. And the two were laughing.
Their time was not unlimited. But Ivolethe had promised Ryoka and so it was. As night passed across the Summer Solstice of every world—the sun shone in Avalon. They flew across the many lands of the fae. They landed, talking, meeting folk.
Laughing, jesting, telling each other stories of what had passed.
