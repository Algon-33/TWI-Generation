Two days later, Maviola El woke up. She inhaled, and cried out at the pain in her chest.
“What—”
She had been dead. She had been—
The two black arrows stood out in her chest. Immobilizing her—her arms and legs were bound. With string as black as the fletching…
“Maviola El. You have left the north.”
Two ringed eyes glowed in the darkness before Belavierr the Stitch Witch emerged. She stood there. Tall. Eyes as vast as forever. Broad hat sweeping low as she bent over Maviola.
“Belavierr.”
Maviola struggled. But her flame—her heart—the pain of the two arrowheads dug into her. She wanted to scream. The battle? She remembered—
She remembered the Gnoll grabbing her as her world went dark. The Drake with the shield—
They had not burned when her soul caught fire. For a simple reason.
The Gnoll and Drake stood there. Perfect in every detail. Eyes empty. Staring straight ahead.
Puppets. Belavierr ignored them as she walked around Maviola. The [Lady] was bound to a plinth of stone.
No. A bier. Like the one they had laid Erin on. Not as cold. But still, chilling.
Maviola’s breath came in gasps. Her clothes were ragged. One of her lungs—she struggled to speak. There was no blood though, from the arrow wounds. Had Belavierr stopped it?
“I…should have known. The arrows did not burn. You—”
The [Witch] waited. Maviola just spat.
“You!”
“Me.”
Belavierr replied, obliviously. Her eyes looked Maviola up and down. The [Witch] went on.
“I saw you. In the orb. You did not die. Then you came south. You should have stayed. Now, I have you.”
“You have nothing, Temptress. Spider! Face me, rather than attack me from afar.”
Maviola struggled. Belavierr’s head twisted sideways and down. She regarded Maviola. Then she did something that made the [Lady] frightened.
She.
Smiled.
“No. I do not think so. I think I have what I want.”
“You will never get anything from me. I have denied you twice now. Touch me. Let us see who comes out unscathed.”
The [Lady] stopped struggling. No one would escape Belavierr so easily. She tried to ignite again, but something was wrong.
“You—what have you done? You aren’t fighting my aura. You—you have killed fire, here.”
“Yes.”
“You can’t do that.”
That was not a [Witch]’s magic. To so simply outlaw fire. Unless Belavierr had made some great working—but twice, Maviola had burned her.
This time? Belavierr just smiled.
“I did not.”
A figure stepped out of the shadows. Maviola had not sensed him at all.
He was dead.
Az’kerash, the Necromancer, bowed slightly to Maviola.
“The Matriarch of the House of El.”
She went still. Suddenly—terrible fear engulfed her.
“Az’kerash. The Necromancer of Terandria.”
Alive. She did not need to be told what that meant. It meant—Maviola looked at him. Now, her eyes adjusted to the room.
She saw the Chosen, standing around, looking down at her. But it was Belavierr whom Maviola feared most. Belavierr and the Necromancer.
She was smiling. Maviola had never seen such an expression on Belavierr’s face. The emotion was—satisfaction. Satisfaction. Pleasure. Gloating, even.
And malice.
“I remember you. Twice. It feels different. Now—I am awake. You burned me.”
“You work with the Spider, Necromancer? Take care. Two monsters of your ilk cannot surely coexist.”
Maviola ignored Belavierr. She spat at Az’kerash. The Necromancer raised one brow. His black eyes and white pupils regarded her.
“I take little pleasure in this, Lady El. But your kind are enemies of mine.”
“The House of El?”
“The living. My children and I will rule over a different world.”
