The Fraerling shook his head. He looked around at the laughing students and at Venaz, who was still guffawing. Niers picked up the nearest object—a tiny mug—and threw it at Venaz. It hit the Minotaur in the eye and he roared in pain.
“No.”
Niers looked back at Umina. His gaze was sad and suddenly, old. He gestured at the scrying orb.
“It would never work, Umina. But it isn’t something to mock, either.”
“It should work.”
The Lizardgirl spoke quietly. Niers nodded. He bowed his head.
“Perhaps—”
He waited. But in his heart he knew. The young woman waved her flag.

“Peace?”
The words were repeated with derision among the nobility. They stared at the distant figure. To them, her voice was so tiny that they had to have it repeated back to them. But the content had gotten through. Some crazed girl was shouting for peace. Tyrion exchanged a look with Jericha.
“She’s right in front of the Goblin Lord’s army, sire. And she is a resident of Liscor—from the Face-Eater moth attack. Should we send a rider to grab her?”
“No.”
Tyrion shook his head. He stared past Jericha, past the Goblin Lord’s army. He couldn’t even see the young woman. Nor could he imagine it. Peace? With the Goblins? With the Drakes? He shook his head again.
“Ignore her. She’s…”
He trailed off. What was she? Deluded? Insane?
“Wrong.”
That was the only word for it. Tyrion looked back at Jericha. He looked away. If this was some kind of stalling tactic, or strange ploy, it was completely useless. It had bought seconds, and for what? No one was listening. The girl’s words were…pointless.

“Goblins are not evil.”
Reiss whispered the words. He heard them again, from the young woman. She shouted them at the army of Goblins. At him.
“I know you can hear me! Hey! Let’s talk! Don’t fight! We’re not enemies! I know you can be good. Just listen! Okay?”
He stared at her. She was just one Human. One, like the others. But she called to him. In his mind, he could sense those Goblins who were Chieftains. He could tell Rags was behind him. And Garen. He could even sense distant powers, far-off presences that might be Goblin Lords as well. But he had never felt something like this.
He could sense her. Not as a similar presence to a chieftain but as an…instinct. Something in him that told him that ahead of him was…safety. A friend. And Reiss wasn’t the only one. The Goblins in his army stared at Erin. And they felt the same certainty.
There she stood. She waved the flag and told them to stop. Reiss listened, but the voice in his head was dismissive.
“A foolish attempt. Why would anyone conceive—ignore fools like that, my apprentice. That girl is not too far from a zombie in terms of intellect. And why she would assume…do I know her?”
“Who is she?”
Reiss stared at the girl. He heard a name in his mind. A memory. Rags speaking of someone, a friend.
Erin Solstice. And for a second, Reiss wanted to go forwards. He wanted to raise a flag of his own and go over to Erin. To talk. He hesitated. His master’s voice was impatient. But the young woman—Reiss began to urge his Shield Spider forwards. If—

“Peace! Rah, rah, peace!”
Erin was running out of things to say. But the Goblin Lord’s army hadn’t moved. She hoped. She smiled and tried to shout the optimism in her chest out to the world.
“We can work things out! We can do this! Yes we can! Truce! Let’s negotiate I have an inn! Parley! Par—”

“Fire.”
