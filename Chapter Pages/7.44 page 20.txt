She was on the ground. Ryoka tasted blood in her mouth. Her head was ringing. She—Ryoka tasted blood. What was—was—?
“Silver and steel!”
Ylawes exclaimed. He’d seen all of it. The Guildmistress had punched Ryoka in the jaw before the young woman could even raise her hands. Then she’d hit Ryoka in the side and while Ryoka was folded up, Mihaela had hit her in the back of the head.
Ryoka was lying on the ground, blood coming from her mouth. Mihaela stood over her.
“Not good. Get up and we’ll try again.”
“Guildmistress! Enough!”
Salamani blocked her, arms outstretched. Ryoka might not even have heard Mihaela; she was trying to get up, clearly dizzy.
“Salamani. You’re starting to annoy me.”
Mihaela saw Ryoka pushing herself up. The City Runner looked around muzzily.
“Wh—dr—”
She was fumbling for a potion. Mihaela pointed at Ryoka’s belt, with a friendly…smile.
“Heal up. This is just a test.”
Ryoka spat, gagging on the blood, and drank from the potion. Some of the dizziness and confusion faded. She spat again.
“I—”
“All healed up? Let’s try again.”
This time Salamani tried to stop her. Ylawes saw it. But however fast the Mage Runner was—and he was quick—Mihaela was faster. She blurred down, ducking Salamani’s hand. Ryoka bl—
Her feet left the ground for a second as Mihaela hit her in the ribs. Ylawes heard something crack. Ryoka fell down and doubled over, clutching at her chest.
“Healing potion. Let’s try again.”
Mihaela stood over her. Salamani whirled.
“Mihaela! Enough!”
It was enough for Ylawes too. He strode forwards. Dawil grabbed for him, cursing.
“Lad—this isn’t a good idea—”
“Guildmistress Godfrey. Isn’t this enough? Ryoka can’t defend herself.”
Ylawes saw Mihaela turn. She looked at him blankly, then Falene and Dawil. The half-Elf hissed with annoyance as she and Dawil joined their captain. But what else was there to do? To Ylawes, nothing.
He blocked Mihaela as Ryoka reached for a high-grade potion, still on the ground. Mihaela looked at Ylawes.
“Who are you? This is Runner’s Guild business, [Knight]. Out of my way.”
She looked around. Some of Reizmelt’s citizens were staring at the Wind Runner, who was part of their city, even if she was only new by a few months. But they were hesitating. They had all seen Mihaela move.
Ylawes felt his skin crawling. But he blocked Mihaela, with Salamani as Falene and Dawil took up his back.
“Guildmistress, I am Ylawes of House Byres. Captain of the Silver Swords. I don’t believe this is just or fair to Miss Griffin. I understand you have reason for anger against Miss Griffin. But please—”
“Get out of my way.”
Mihaela looked past him at Ryoka. The City Runner was looking up.
“That’s right. Get up, Ryoka. Show me your abilities.”
Mihaela smiled again. Kindly. Ylawes slowly reached for his shield.
“Guildmistress.”
She looked up at him.
“I’m warning you, boy. I know your mother. Get out of my way or I’ll remove you. You too, Salamani.”
“Oh no.”
That came from Dawil. He had already drawn his hammer. He was just looking at Mihaela. So was Ylawes.
If there was a Named-rank version of Couriers—that was Mihaela Godfrey. But the [Knight] gritted his teeth.
“No, Guildmistress. Enough. This is not honorable.”
Mihaela said nothing. She just narrowed her eyes.
“Mihaela. Ryoka saved my life. Enough.”
Salamani had drawn his wand. Falene took a few steps back. She pointed at Ryoka.
“[Forcewall: Bubble].”
A shimmering wall formed around Ryoka. Mihaela sighed. Dawil groaned.
“Oh no.”
“Dawil, would you stop saying t—”
