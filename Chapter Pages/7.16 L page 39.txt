Two more artists for the break. There are a lot of amazing pictures, but mg and brack both deserve this one. For the Antinium. We have Chesacre and Thaina (very lewd), and art of Purple Smiles and so many characters…I love it. Truly, it makes me smile.
With all that said, I’ll be back in a bit. But I need a vacation. Just for a moment. Thanks for reading and see you soon.
