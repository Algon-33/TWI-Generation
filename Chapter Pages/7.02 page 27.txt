The young woman sat heavily, staring at nothing. The Drake went on.
“Dead gods, all those deaths on your conscience? And you could have avoided it all? You’re a monster. If I had a club, I’d go over and smack your brains out.”
“I deserve it.”
Saliss nodded.
“You are walking scum. Scum! I’ve known Crelers who deserved more love than you!”
Erin looked up and glared at him.
“You can stop now. I get the point.”
The [Alchemist] grinned at her.
“Was I saying anything you disagreed with?”
Erin hesitated. Then she shook her head.
“No. People died and I could have stopped it. Toren was my fault. I just never—”
Saliss poured the ground-up root into a container.
“You made a mistake. And I’m no Watch Captain who can tell you how much was your fault. But that one was yours. Still—the thing with Pelt? That’s different. And I think you’re mixing the two up in your head. You used a Skill that got that old Dwarf to make something he was proud of.”
“But he was crying.”
Saliss laughed. Erin’s head shot up angrily. The Drake waved at her.
“Sorry, sorry. I know you’re upset. But Pelt cries when he spills his beer. He’s a terrible drunk! So you made him cry and cause a stir. So what? That Dwarf hasn’t made something he was proud of since he came to Pallass. If all it took was a bit of a stir—hells, I’d have blown up Maughin’s forge too if it meant giving the Dwarf something. So what if you caused a scene? The question is: was it worth the cost?”
He looked at Erin with a grin. The young woman stared. Then she remembered something. Pelt’s last look towards her. His words.
The craft thanks you. She hesitated.
“I don’t know.”
“Fair enough. But I think it was. Your problem, Erin, is that you just don’t know how to control your Skill. You let it get out of control. You don’t know what it does.”
“True. So what do I do?”
“Find out. Obviously.”
Saliss flipped a vial over his shoulder and caught it in the other hand. He waggled his tail in delight. Then he looked at Erin.
“Mind showing me?”
She blinked at him.
“What? Show you my Skill? That’s what got me in here!“
“So show me! How much worse could it get? That’s another famous set of last words. I think I knew a fellow who said that right before he melted his bones.”
The [Alchemist] laughed. Erin blinked at his back. Then she paused.
“It’s just so sad.”
“Show me.”
Saliss looked at her. Erin bristled, but the [Alchemist] didn’t blink. He gave Erin a steady look out of the corner of his eye.
“What’s the worst that could happen? Really. All that would happen is that I’d burst into tears, and then I’d stop annoying you.”
Erin’s lips almost twitched at that. He had a point. Reluctantly, she put her hands together. And it wasn’t hard. All she had to do was think of Toren. And Pelt. Her grief and guilt rose. It was all she could think about.
Guilt, and pain. And sorrow.
And there it was again. Erin felt the memory burning. And then there was fire. In her hands. A blue flame licked upwards. Erin stared at it—
“Prisoner using a Skill!”
A bellow rang through the prison. Erin jumped and saw a [Guard] pounding towards her, a huge baton drawn. Erin panicked, but Saliss whirled.
“Shh. Shh. It’s fine.”
He stuck an arm out of his cell. The charging Drake skidded to a stop.
“Sir Saliss? But—”
She looked uncertainly at him, and then at her companions, who had rushed over at her shout. Saliss leaned against his cell and waved at them.
“Hello! Thanks for shouting my earholes off. But I’m fine. This young woman is just showing me a Skill. Go on. Shoo.”
