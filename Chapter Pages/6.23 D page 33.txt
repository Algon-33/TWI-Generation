“Something like that. You’ve all said this is a game, yeah?”
“Of course. Have you ever seen a battle this bloodless?”
Venaz lifted an eyebrow. Luan ignored him. He glanced down at the map, then at his coin purse.
“Well then. You bought me. And you bought out the [Healers].”
He nodded at Marian. She nodded slowly. Umina felt her brain fizzling. She raced ahead of Luan’s words. He didn’t mean—
“Ten gold’s what’s motivating the soldiers of your company to fight, right? So why not—”
“Why not bribe them to help us!”
Umina sat bolt upright. Luan nodded. Marian started.
“Bribe them? It’d never work. [Soldiers] are loyal, especially to a Great Company. The idea of bribing any of them to follow us—”
“In a battle. Obviously not. That would be suicide for them and us. But this isn’t a battle, is it, Marian?”
Venaz looked up quietly. Marian hesitated. Then she grabbed her coin pouch.
“Luan, can I borrow—one, two, damn, I brought a lot, but—”
“If I had my coin pouch—”
“Shut it, Venaz.”
Umina glanced up as the Minotaur and Centauress began counting and calculating. She met Luan’s eyes. The Human man had a slight smile on his face. A pleased expression. Umina felt a flash of admiration. And then curiosity.
“You have a unique way of thinking. That’s twice now you surprised us.”
“I’m sure you’d have come up with something. You’re all taking this more seriously than I am, besides.”
That was true. Umina was sweating with nerves. She needed to use the toilet before she went. She hopped from one foot to another.
“Still, have you ever been a [Strategist]? Or thought of being one? Do you play chess?”
An odd expression crossed Luan’s face.
“Me? No. Never. But I do know chess. Do you think this will help you win?”
Umina hesitated. She looked at Venaz and Marian, alight with the idea. Then she shook her head.
“…No. Assuming Marian has five hundred gold pieces, which she doesn’t, how many could we hire? Two hundred? One hundred? No. This will help, but it’ll be luck and something else if we beat Tulm. And that’s not how a battle should go. The Professor doesn’t believe in luck.”
Luan nodded. His eyes flicked to Umina.
“In that case, maybe you should change plans.”
“No. I mean, no, your idea’s great. It’s just…there’s something more to it.”
Umina spoke slowly. Luan’s plan was making her own brain buzz. She had a thought, nibbling at the corner of her mind. She pursued it as she thought.
“A truly great plan is something no one expects. Something original. But a great idea is only the first step. A [Strategist] builds on that idea. They take the unexpected and turn it into something no one is prepared for. Like…hold on. I need to go to the bathroom.”
The Lizardgirl hurried out of the room. She couldn’t hold it anymore. And as she was sitting on the toilet, she had it. She raced back into the room. She didn’t even wash her claws.
“Luan. I have an idea. Will you listen?”
She told him the idea, whispering to him in a corner. The City Runner’s face lit up and he grinned.
“That is smart. But would your Tulm the Mithril expect it?”
“Maybe. Maybe not. But if it works, it’s sure to work. And this might be something even his [Mages] miss. It’s so…basic. And it would be quick. So quick—but—”
Umina hesitated. She looked at Marian. Could she do that to her friend? Tell her to risk it all on this? No. Marian would hate gambling it all on this. But Umina had nothing to lose. She looked at Luan.
“I’m going to try it. Can I…can I ask you to let them know?”
“Of course.”
Luan stared at the Lizardgirl. Umina hesitated.
“Maybe I should tell Marian…”
