Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)

“I should have known a crew like this would have one or two traitors. But you served on my ship four years. What did it take?”
“Just gold, Cap’n. No hard feelings, eh?”
Begal was smiling widely, desperately as he backed up. Captain Lasc aimed his shortsword at the man’s chest.
“Who hired you? How many more are with you? Tell us—and I might not keelhaul you right where you stand.”
The [Sailor] looked from side to side. His eyes darted. And then—he smiled.
“How many, Captain? More’n one or two. Looks like the jig’s up, boys. Show Captain Lasc how many of us were bought.”
There was a sound. Metal, sliding on metal. The crowd around Wil moved. [Sailors] stepped back. The crew of three hundred was on deck. And of that number—
Over two thirds of the crew drew their blades. Wil felt his stomach drop through the deck. Captain Lasc stared around, eyes wide. Delivan swore.
“All of you? You salt-sucking traitors!”
“Sorry, Captain Lasc. But everyone heard that there’d be real treasure on this voyage. We’ve been keeping our real employers updated every day and night.”
Another [Sailor] spoke up. She had a hand-crossbow aimed at Delivan’s chest. The loyal crew, less than a hundred, faced over two hundred mutineers. Wil looked to his side.
Inky stood with the loyalists. So did the [Storm Sailors], all of them. The female [Sailor] didn’t seem concerned as the [Storm Sailors] stood, looking around tensely, outnumbered two-to-one.
“I know [Storm Sailors] are good, but you and the [Strategists] are flanked, Captain Lasc. Throw down your blade. The treasure belongs to our employers.”
The mutineers nodded. Captain Lasc’s jaw twitched. Wil saw Venaz tensing by the table. But he had two dozen blades aimed at him. Merrik and Peki were standing together. But there were so many—and they had the drop on Wil’s side.
“Let’s negotiate. You heard King Fetohep. The curse—”
Wil croaked. He saw the female [Sailor] turn the crossbow towards him.
“I reckon that Fetohep will negotiate with whoever had the blades, boyo. And my bosses can defeat one curse. They know treasure. There’s no negotiations.”
Begal nodded. He bared his teeth. He opened his mouth, but the female [Sailor] spoke over him.
“The Bloodtear Pirates will have the swords. And any man, woman, or Selphid who don’t want to be slaughtered will surrender now.”
Wil stared at her in shock. So did the [Sailors]. Begal hesitated.
“The Bloodtear…? We’re working for the Undersea Crews! Therrium himself’s paying us, you idiot!”
The female [Sailor] blinked. She turned her head.
“The Undersea Crews?”
Another [Sailor] laughed incredulously.
“We’re hired by Savere! Are you both mad?”
“Wait—who’s with Savere? And who’s Bloodtear?”
“I’m with the Screaming Sails. The Bloodtears are our enemies!”
Another [Sailor] shouted. The organized mutineers looked at each other. They tried to point their blades at each other. And that was a mistake. Because one man knew whose side he was on.
Captain Lasc. As the [Sailors] around him wavered, his hand moved. He stepped forwards and beheaded Begal. He turned, stabbed his sword through another [Sailor]’s face. And his fist moved. He struck four chins and the [Sailors] crumpled. The mutineers stared as the [Storm Captain] raised his blade. He brought it down, slashing through the [Sailor] threatening Wil.
“To me, [Storm Sailors]! Slaughter these mutinous dogs!”
The stalemate erupted into chaos. Wil saw Venaz explode upwards. The mutineers began attacking Lasc’s crew—and each other, shouting. Three stabbed Venaz in the back.
