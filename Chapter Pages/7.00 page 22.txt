“Erin Solstice, she is not here still? Lyonette?”
The [Princess] paused.
“Not yet. But she knows the inn’s back. At least, her Skills are active. Her [Grand Theatre] Skill began working two days ago. But she’s still away.”
“What’s that? Excuse me. Hello! I’m sorry to intrude, but—”
A voice interrupted Lyonette. Fals hurried over. The City Runner paused, recoiling as Apista fanned her wings threateningly.
“Oh! Fals!”
Lyonette ever-so-gently flicked Apista’s head and the bee, mollified, relaxed. Fals smiled.
“I didn’t think you’d recognize me amid all the crowd. Hello! It’s good to see you Miss Lyonette and, er…Miss Krshia?”
“Good morning to you.”
Krshia growled a polite greeting. So did Elirr, who introduced himself. The Gnoll plucked the cat off his shoulder as it tried to climb up.
“Shoo. You wanted to see the inn? Well, I hope Mrsha eats you.”
Affronted, the cat leapt from the Gnoll’s shoulder. She landed on the ground and came face-to-face with a very large Gnoll cub. Well, by cat standards. Mrsha was a giant compared to any housecat. The cat warily backed away. Mrsha grinned. They darted into the crowd, playing a game of Gnoll-and-cat.
“Mrsha! Don’t—”
Lyonette sighed. The confusion was familiar and aggravating. But the inn was filling! It was in fact, raucous. But someone was missing. Fals looked around.
“Is Miss Erin not here?”
“Not yet. Do you have business with her?”
“I would like to see her. I imagine many of us here would.”
Elirr nodded to the tables full of friends and single enemy contained in Lism. Olesm was staring at the dedicated chess tables that some Antinium were already filling. But he too looked around.
“I actually have a delivery. That’s why I’m here. And to talk, obviously. But I have—”
Fals had produced a rather large, square object, wrapped very securely. Lyonette eyed it, curious, but she had to shake her head.
“She’s not here, Fals.”
“You mean, she’s out?”
“Hey! Where’s Erin? This pasta doesn’t taste like her pasta! I’ll have another thanks, and a hamburger. Where’s Erin?”
Relc shouted, waving a fork and trying to talk around a mouthful of pasta. Lyonette sighed. She looked at Fals.
“She’ll be back. But maybe not just yet, Fals. Can I take the package for her?”
“I have to give it to her. If she’s out on a walk…”
“No. She’s not here.”
It took the City Runner a moment to realize what Lyonette was saying. He paused, and looked at her.
“Then where is she?”
“Pallass. On holiday.”
Lyonette said it simply. Krshia nodded, her eyes flicking to Lyonette, then back to the magical door. Fals paused.
“For two weeks?”
“She needed a break. She’ll come back. When she’s ready. At lot happened while you were away. And I think Erin needed time. I’ll try to get word to her that you’re here. She should know the inn’s open.”
The City Runner hesitated. ‘Can I go to Pallass?’ was something of a hard question, even though he knew the door was able to take him there. He settled for nodding.
“Do you think she’ll be back tonight?”
Lyonette’s pause was telling. Fals sighed. And some of the old guests were catching on. From their seats, four of the Antinium were rising. Lyonette saw and waved a hand.
“Excuse me, I’ve got to keep moving. Take a seat, please!”
She ushered the others to a seat and then made her way to the Antinium. There were four of them. Pawn, Yellow Splatters, and…Lyonette stared at the other two.
