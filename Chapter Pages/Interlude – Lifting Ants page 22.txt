Interlude – Lifting Ants
Page 22
Anand walked on Bird’s other side. The [Hunter] took them down, through twisting corridors, past large rooms in the earth. To a place where a sanctuary of another sort had been built. But one made of faith as much as dirt and paint.
The Painted Antinium were relaxing. Reading. Sparring lightly, resting, eating. Being something other than Worker and Soldier. They paused as Bird entered the room.
They stared at him. At Mrsha. And Anand. There was something different about Bird. The way he stood. The way he walked. If Mrsha had to put it to a name, it was…proudly. A new thing, in the Antinium.
“Bird. Anand? Mrsha? What is this? Is something wrong?”
Pawn got to his feet in alarm as the three walked forwards. So did Yellow Splatters. Pawn had been giving one of his communions. Bird walked past the Antinium to him. He held out a third hand.
“Hello, Pawn. You should come with me. And you, Yellow Splatters. Hello. And Belgrade. And Garry, too.”
All the Antinium were there, minus Garry. Klbkch had forbidden any of them from leaving the Hive. That included the two armored figures observing.
“What is this? Do the Free Antinium allow…intruders into the Hive? This is a breach of security, Tersk! Pawn, explain!”
Dekass exclaimed as he and Tersk of the Armored Antinium stared at Bird. Bird tilted his head.
“Oh, hello Tersk. You may come too. And you. Hello, you.”
Dekass stiffened as Bird waved with his fourth arm. Pawn was just staring. Dekass glanced around and then opened his mandibles stiffly.
“You are addressing a Prognugator of the Armored Antinium! Prognugator Tersk is his title.”
“And Tersk is his name. I forget yours.”
Bird turned away from Dekass. He looked at Pawn.
“Come, Pawn. There is something you must see.”
“I do not understand, Bird. Erin told Belgrade there was something special at her inn, but she wanted all of us to visit.”
“Yes. The hill. You must see it. Come.”
Bird gently tugged at Pawn’s hand. The [Priest] hesitated.
“But Bird, Klbkch has forbidden it. Anand?”
He looked at the [Tactician]. But Anand was frozen. Bird smiled.
“I do not care what Klbkch says. You must come now. Let us get Garry, too.”
He pointed. And he began to walk back towards the entrance to the barracks. Pawn stared at Mrsha. She waved a paw at him. And he began to follow.
“Pawn.”
Yellow Splatter’s deep voice interrupted Pawn. The [Priest] looked at the [Sergeant].
“If Bird says so, Yellow Splatters…he has never ever asked something of us. Let us go.”
“How many?”
“Everyone.”
The Painted Antinium looked at Bird. He turned his head. And they looked at Pawn, and Yellow Splatters. And something happened. As one, the Painted Antinium, Workers and Soldiers, began to follow Bird. Though Mrsha was certain Pawn and Yellow Splatters had not told them to.
They all followed Bird. Some objected. Belgrade asked questions. Pawn did too, but he fell silent. Yellow Splatters was speaking about Klbkch being on duty, but if—Bird ignored them all.
“Do you have permission to do this, Individual Bird?”
Tersk looked at Bird as they walked through the Hive. The [Hunter] nodded.
“I have my own.”
Now an army of Antinium followed Bird, Mrsha, and Anand. The Painted Antinium, those who had been chosen. Who believed. And Bird. There was a difference. The other Antinium watched them. And they looked at Bird.
Because he wore no paint. Bird made one last stop in the Hive.
“Hello, my Queen. Can Garry come with us?”
