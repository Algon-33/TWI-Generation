As Tyrion Veltras rode forwards, cupping one ear. As Reiss and Az’kerash stared through the same eyes. Under the gazes of the horrified defenders of Liscor. Watched by the world through a half-Elf’s eyes. And to the listening Goblins, Drakes, Humans, Antinium, and all the rest. She shouted.
“Peace! I want a truce! Parley! Parley! Cease-fire!”
Erin Solstice waved the flag over her head, trying to make the bed sheet that was the flag wave in the non-existent breeze. She wished she’d chosen a smaller pole. The flag was heavy and her arms were already hurting. But she kept waving the flag. The Goblin Lord’s army had stopped and behind it, she could see the Human one. Distant ranks of warriors dressed in armor glinted at her.
Humans. Her people. More of them than she’d ever seen in one place in this world. Gathered for war. But it couldn’t be war. It shouldn’t be. The Goblins weren’t evil! And Liscor wasn’t a bad place! Erin didn’t know the history that had brought the Humans—led by this Tyrion Veltras—here. She didn’t care. She only knew what her heart told her. And it had led her here.
“Hey! Don’t attack! Let’s talk it out! Talk! Give peace a chance! War, is it really any good? Let’s talk about this!”
Erin shouted with her [Loud Voice] Skill. Her words bounced off Liscor’s walls, echoed across the Floodplains. It sounded awful to Erin. She didn’t have a speech. But she kept shouting, waving her flag. Her knees were shaking.
There were so many Goblins. And these ones were dressed in black armor. They carried terrible weapons and—if there ever was an evil army, it would be them. Their crimson eyes fixed on Erin. Like green demons. But that wasn’t them. This wasn’t them. Erin had to believe it.
“Peace! Say it with me! Peace! That’s all we want! Peace! Peace! Please? Peace!”

“Peace!”
“I don’t believe it. She’s going to die.”
Zevara covered her eyes. Ilvriss stared down at Erin. He agreed.
“She isn’t serious. Does she think that Tyrion Veltras will listen to her after coming all this way? That the Goblin Lord will?”
He shook his head. It was a foolish dream. But he kept his eyes on her. And he heard a voice.
“Wall Lord! Wall Lord!”
He glanced over. The [Mage] was staring at him.
“What?”
“The Walled Cities. Wall Lord, they’re asking who that is. Everyone can hear her, sir.”
“They can?”
Ilvriss looked at Falene. The half-Elf was staring at Erin. So was everyone else. Erin’s voice echoed distantly towards them.
“Hey, can you even hear me? Someone wave if you can! I want a truce! Uh, an armistice? Parley! Is that only pirates?”

“Ridiculous. Who is that?”
Half of the students in the room were dying of laughter. The other half were just staring and shaking their heads. Venaz was slapping the table hard enough to make it shake. But Niers Astoragon was just staring.
“Her.”
He knew her. He had seen her in the battle for Liscor. And he—yes, he remembered her then too. Her voice echoed back to him. Peace. She was shouting for it, waving her flag at the Goblins. And they were just staring at her.
Niers’ heart hurt. He looked at the scrying orb, and then away.
“Professor?”
Umina wasn’t laughing. She looked at the Titan. He glanced at her.
“Umina?”
“Would that work? Ever?”
The Titan stared back at the young woman. She was shouting as loudly as she could. He could hear her voice crack.
“Come on! We can work together! Goblins aren’t evil. They aren’t bad! It doesn’t have to be like this!”
“No.”
