A voice croaked. Richard stopped. A Drake was lying on a stretcher. A [Healer] was tending to him, but Captain Shellc was trying to sit up. Someone had taken out his eye and Silvenia’s flames had scarred his right side. He spoke, desperately, as the young man from Earth halted.
“I can’t leave. I can’t—my command is here. Cirille is here. Tell them to let me stay. I have to keep fighting. We don’t run. Please?”
Shellc reached for Richard’s hand. The young man stared at him until the Drake collapsed, put to sleep by the [Healer]’s touch. Richard backed away.

He found Lord Hayvon standing alone. The older man was leaning heavily on his horse. He turned as Richard approached.
“Oh. Richard.”
“Lord Hayvon? Are you…”
Are you okay? Richard closed his mouth on the question. He saw the [Lord] standing there. Away from everyone else, out of sight, Hayvon shook his head.
“We were too late, Richard. Too late. The Death of Magic broke our wall in hours. Like I could break a stick. I thought we could withstand her. What a fool I was. I truly thought we had more time. I thought with a new wall—”
He wiped water from his eyes and shook his head.
“We will fight on. But this is a dark day. Enough. But enough…let us at least give some meaning to this carnage. I was too late. I will bear guilt of that to the nations who entrusted the Blighted Kingdom with their warriors. Yet I will at least see them home.”
He clenched his fist. And his horse reared. Richard felt something move across the walls. He looked at the [Lord] who had been so misrepresented by a book. Richard heard a cry in the distance.
“Cirille!”
Richard spun. He ran, hearing Tom’s cry. It couldn’t be—he had seen her—
Dead. The Drake’s body lay on the ground, where she had died. And nothing could change that. Not anything they had. If—
No. She was dead. But she also stood there. Commander Cirille turned her head. Richard stopped, eyes wide. And the Drake looked at him.
“What is this?”
Richard heard a cry. Captain Shellc stared up as Ossky alighted on the ground. Across the walls, he heard exclamations. Shouts of fear.
“Commander!”
Viri screamed as he saw Uxel slither past him. The Gorgon paused a moment. And it was him.
Not him. Tom reached for Cirille. And his hand passed through her. The ghost offered him a bitter smile and saluted.
“It is their memory, Sir Richard. Sir Tom.”
The [Clown] spun. But he stopped as Hayvon came to stand before them. The [Lord] bowed to Cirille.
“Commander. We will take your remains to the Walled Cities. You are a hero of Rhir. I salute you.”
He knelt. Slowly, the [Soldiers] did likewise. The Drake turned. She met Merish’s eyes as he struggled to rise.
They were all there. Gnolls, Drakes. Minotaurs. Viri tried to use his staff like a cane. He hopped after Uxel.
“Commander. Wait for me. Wait!”
“Stay there, Viri.”
Uxel spoke. It was his voice. The Gorgon looked…well, annoyed. Even in death, he snapped at the little Lizardman.
“Thank you, Lord Hayvon. Chief Warrior Merish. I leave it to you.”
The Drake turned. She walked forwards. An army of ghosts followed.
They stood in formation. The pride of Izril. Gnolls, Drakes—with Uxel’s forces mixed in. Ser Vorn walked forwards, glancing back at his body.
“How?”
Richard whispered. This was beyond anything he had witnessed, even as terrible as the Death of Magic had been.
Lord Hayvon rose. He drew his sword and saluted them as the army began marching away. Some, Rhir’s own, walked towards their walls. The others turned in other directions.
Going home.
“[The Pride of the Fallen]. Come, Sir Richard. We must honor them.”
