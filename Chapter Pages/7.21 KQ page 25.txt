He stood there, waiting for the ship to come in. And the [Popstar] brought the streets of Phel’s Light to a standstill.

“People, people! We’ll be performing in thirty minutes! The Singer needs her privacy! Thank you!”
The [Manager] of the tour, a young woman from earth, bellowed into the crowd, her voice amplified by her Skill. They backed off—if only because it was true the wagons needed to set up. The Singer of Terandria had been given the largest plaza to perform in and the wagons were moving into it.
Setting up so everyone could see her perform. The crews that came with her were experienced; they were already putting up a circular stage with bags of holding, and a pair of [Illusionists] were getting ready.
But the main star and her band were all in a single wagon. Oh, they had special effects. Makeup. Props. But the song was the thing. And while the [Singer]’s crew moved around the wagons, getting ready, no one, absolutely no one was allowed in the private wagon that belonged to the Queen of Pop.
Only her closest confidants were allowed in there. As the self-styled ‘Queen of Pop’ disappeared into her wagon with her band, a group of eight sighed and relaxed.
One of them, the young man with a guitar, was protesting at the wagon.
“Come on. Just a peek? She’s a [Baroness]. Just for a moment. Ask Cara if—”
“Absolutely not. You know the rules.”
The [Manager] snapped back at the [Guitarist]. She smiled at the disappointed [Baroness] and her friends, who were clustered around the young man. His cheeks were flushed, but the [Ladies] dropped the matter first.
“We hope we can speak with the Singer later?”
The [Baroness]’s friends looked at the young man with the guitar. He blushed.
“Of course! I’ll make it happen. After the concert…”
The noise faded as he climbed into the wagon. The entire vehicle was perfectly sealed against outside noise. It was also enchanted to be bigger on the inside than the outside.
There were even sofas, a kitchen in the back…it was a mobile base. Costly, but the Queen of Pop had bought it and renovated it. Now, the band relaxed.
And they were a band. Aside from the [Manager] and one young man from Argentina who was setting up their electronics—he had a pair of speakers connected to a laptop—the rest of the band had instruments.
A [Drummer], a [Bassist], the lead guitar…each one of them had an instrument they could play. Or…pretend to play. After all, the songs were augmented by actual music from the laptop and speakers.
But a few of them were actual musicians. The [Drummer] for instance, needed no help. He’d been an actual member of his band back from home. The [Guitarist]…? Not so much.
The [Singer] was real, though. Before her band, she’d sung alone, with only karaoke music on an iPhone enhanced by a spell for backup. She had become the Queen of Pop, the beloved icon sweeping across Terandria, creating a wave of music and a new culture among young folk.
As the door closed, the Singer smiled at the awestruck young [Ladies], her fans. Then the door shut. The [Manager] locked it. And the [Guitarist]—winced as the [Popstar]’s smile vanished.
“Stop listenin’ to the plámásing cunts thats yer wan I wouldn’t let in here you stupid fook.”
Cara O’Sullivan strode over and poked the [Guitarist]—Greg—in the chest. Hard. She stopped smiling. And her natural accent—Irish—came out. The rest of the band…looked at each other, trying to figure out what she’d said.
“Uh—what?”
