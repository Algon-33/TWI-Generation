The two Goblins stood together as the Goblins moved past them. They were tired, but they moved at a good pace nonetheless. The Goblins stared as they moved. At the little Goblin standing next to the fat Hob. She had not crushed the Humans. But she had hurt them. She had even spared some for some reason. She had set a forest ablaze.

“Maybe. Something will change. Or not. Humans still chasing. We still probably dying. But this is different.”
“What?”
The little Goblin reached up and touched her chest. She looked at Pyrite and smiled wearily.
“Us.”
