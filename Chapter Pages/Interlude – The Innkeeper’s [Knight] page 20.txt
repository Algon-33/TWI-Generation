Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 20
Exasperated, the [Captain] swept his hand through his hair. Rabbiteater didn’t expect him to acquiesce. They were captives. But…he did.
Because Rabbiteater was a [Knight].
“Fine! It stays on! We don’t need to lop off a finger. Dead gods. Just get that [Mage] in here!”
The other Ailendamus [Soldiers] murmured as the [Lieutenant] took over. Rabbiteater heard them whispering.
“Heard he’s killed more Goblins than a Named Adventurer. Over a thousand Hobgoblins slain by his hand.”
“Who told you that?”
“One of the [Knights]. Swore she saw him kill an Ogre in battle with a single blow. Threw his weapon. Fights with anything he’s got. Sets traps—a Goblin’s worst nightmare.”
“Huh. Do you think he takes requests? My home had a Goblin tribe problem…”
See how they looked at him. Respect? Pity? Curiosity?
They were wrong about him. Both his captors and his friends.
He was no [Knight].
He was not the Goblin Slayer.
He wasn’t even Human.
He was a Hobgoblin, a Redfang, far from home. He had lost his tribe, lost his brothers in arms. Lost…
What…what was he supposed to be doing again? Rabbiteater wished it had not come to this.
Then the [Mage] arrived. The [Lieutenant] conferred, and the [Mage] just shrugged.
“I don’t need much. Let me just set up the [Truth] spell.”
It was a glowing light. Even Rabbiteater knew truth spells. The color binary was yellow and purple for whatever reason. But it was always the same.
Yellow was truth. Purple was falsehood. Any mix was a half-truth. The [Mage] sat back as he conducted the interview with the [Lieutenant]’s help.
“All we need to know is who to contact. And…a name to give them.”
“His oath—”
“Would you two shut up? We’ll use whatever he wants! Goblin Slayer! Ser Solstice!”
The [Lieutenant] barked. Rabbiteater saw Talia was writing a [Message] on a scroll, corresponding with the Order of Seasons or House Kallinad. He supposed he’d have to do the same.
But the first step was harder than it looked.
“Who do we contact, [Knight]?”
“No one. No one to ransom.”
He had hope he’d live if House Kallinad would pay for him. That his [Knight]’s vow would keep his helmet on because of the Human’s silly rules. The [Mage] sighed, exasperated.
“Tricky one, huh? You get one in every ransom group. Everyone thinks they’re all alone. But they always have someone who’ll shell out gold for them. You have someone like that, Ser Knight.”
“No. I don’t.”
The truth spell was yellow. Only a hint of purple. The [Lieutenant] hesitated.
“Pretty clear to me…”
“Nonsense! He just thinks that. Truth spells aren’t infallible. Let me jog his memory.”
The [Mage] seemed to be taking his job seriously or it was a point of personal pride. Maybe he was a [Ransomer]?
The [Mage] leaned forwards and Rabbiteater saw he had a hawkish nose and a rather weak chin. Olive skin…distressingly attractive pink irises that didn’t fit his rough-and-ready appearance.
“Family. Everyone’s got family. Where’s yours?”
“Dead.”
Talia stirred. So did Markus. The Goblin Slayer had never talked about his past. The [Mage] glanced at the spell.
Half-truth. He sighed dramatically.
“Fine. Let’s take it one by one. First…Mother?”
“Dead.”
“…Father?”
“Don’t know. Probably dead.”
“Siblings?”
“Dead.”
The [Mage] checked himself. They were all complete truths.
“Er…were they accidents? Disease? Natural causes?”
“Oh come on, Telich—”
The [Lieutenant] hissed at him. Rabbiteater looked at the [Mage]. The truth spell tempted him.
“Murdered.”
Yellow truth shone through. The [Mage] hesitated. Someone muttered a word.
“Goblins.”
