“Sorry. I’m not used to guests while I work. I had Erin—but she mainly melted holes in my kitchen pot. I er, you heard what Xif said? About [Alchemists] not sharing recipes?”
Numbtongue nodded. Octavia sighed.
“Cloth moths to that. I know it’s all the thing in most continents, but back home we used to share recipes. I mean, everyone had their secret recipe, but I could at least swap tips. I guess Xif really is the top-[Alchemist] of course. But back home any [Alchemist] would stop by to check out my Haste Potion sample, top-tier or not! I hoped—but I got some tips from him. That’s something. Sorry. Anyways, I’m just going to make the potion. Don’t mind the lights. Or smell.”
She lit a burner with a match. It was some kind of magical burner, although Numbtongue saw it was running on coals—heating them up and igniting them. Octavia grinned weakly.
“Magical burner. I paid for it. Helps with the process. Not necessary; I could make healing potions with a few pots and a kitchen fire.”
“How?”
Numbtongue couldn’t help but ask. Octavia shrugged.
“What? Healing potions? It’s just a small formula. A few Skills. Nothing interesting. I mean—unless you’re actually interested?”
She looked up and blinked. Numbtongue was nodding rapidly. Octavia blinked.
“Really? Most people don’t like [Alchemy]. It stinks and it can be uh, messy. Do Goblins like alchemy? Are there…Goblin [Alchemists]?”
Numbtongue shook his head.
“Goblins don’t make potions. Goblins steal potions. No Goblin knows how to make potions. Not even [Shamans].”
“Really? Do your [Shamans] have special recipes?”
Octavia looked hopeful. Numbtongue considered that.
“Healing paste. You put herbs in mouth and chew. Then spit.”
“Oh. How useful is it?”
“Stops bleeding. Heals a tiny bit.”
Both the Stitch-Girl and Hobgoblin grimaced. Octavia hesitated. She looked thoughtfully at the ingredients.
“Well, I’m just a low-level [Alchemist]. Little better than a [Mixer], really. That’s an apprentice, by the way. Kids get that class. But if you want—”
“Hey! Anyone bullying Numbtongue?”
The door blasted open as Erin appeared. Numbtongue fell out of his chair and Octavia’s jump nearly sent her ingredients flying. Erin looked around and paused, frying pan in hand.
“Oh. Never mind. Hey Numbtongue, Octavia, you want to come back? Just say when!”
She stared at them. They stared back. Numbtongue slowly shook his head.
“Okay! Cool! Check in thirty minutes?”
Another nod. The door slammed shut. Octavia caught her breath after Erin was gone. She stared at Numbtongue and he met her eyes with his wide ones. Then, suddenly, they both started laughing. And that was a connection. After that, Octavia set up and Numbtongue scooted a stool over and learned how to make a potion.
