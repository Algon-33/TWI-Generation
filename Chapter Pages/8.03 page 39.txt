Duh. Mrsha wrote, getting ink on her white fur while Ulvama read. She blinked.
“Erin’s fire? Magical fire? [Like Fire, Memory]? Ooh. Oh. Hm, hm—went out?”
She looked at Mrsha’s wretched face. The Gnoll held up a pleading note.
“Please bring it back! Is there more?”
Ulvama checked Mrsha up and down. The Hobgoblin gave her a big smile. And edged back.
“Um. All gone. Sorry.”
She’d taken it off Mrsha. The Gnoll looked at her and fell flat on her back. Ulvama hurried over.
“I thought it was bad! Kept changing! I didn’t know! It kept burning little Gnoll. See?”
She grabbed Mrsha and the Gnoll saw her lift her arm. Sure enough; the fur on her arm was short. Mrsha stared. She hadn’t noticed.
“You said, flame went out when dead Human—er—Erin tried to give it to you?”
Mrsha nodded. Ulvama nodded wisely.
“Ah, but some on little Mrsha-child. Because…fur is flammable.”
She pronounced her scientific hypothesis as to why the flame had lingered. Mrsha blinked at her a few times. So a spark had remained. So small she hadn’t noticed it, on her fur. A bit of hope and kindness and Erin’s fire, still burning.
And now it was gone, thanks to Ulvama. The little [Druid] nodded solemnly. She put two paws in her mouth and whistled. Time for the Beaver-gang.
“No, stop!”
Ulvama waved a frantic claw. She pointed at Mrsha’s notes as ominous furry beavers surfaced out of the pond. Apista buzzed around Ulvama’s face and the Hobgoblin ducked. The little [Druid] held up a paw. And what did Ulvama have to say?
“Fire went out. Not good. But…so what? Give me one chance. Help me—and I help you.”
Ulvama pleaded with Mrsha. She looked at the little Gnoll. She did not regret taking the fire. Perhaps it had been burning those emotions away to survive. It was a glorious thing. But dangerous. Mrsha looked at her, confused.
But a flicker of that same fire in her eyes. Ulvama reached out and took Mrsha’s paw. She looked at the little Gnoll’s face and understood at last.
She did not know the story. But she saw what Mrsha needed.
“Come with me.”

Sammial was red-faced. Not crying—but he had tears in his eyes from refusing to cry.
He had a scratch on his cheek; another boy had been kicked in the gonads. The wind had died. Ryoka looked at the upset children.
“I think that’s enough flying for today, guys.”
“Sammy!”
Hethon rounded on his younger brother. Sammy was red-faced.
“It wasn’t my fault! They wouldn’t give me a turn! And I asked! Politely!”
“It’s not Sammy’s fault—”
Entirely. Ryoka soothed the children. They’d gotten a good thirty minutes of playing, anyways. And she—she was out of sorts. She had fumbled around with the Techblade—Faeblade—dead gods, she needed a better name for it—long enough.
The truth was, she was still mourning. Still grieving Erin. She had not processed it while hope remained. Now? She had only two avenues left. One easier than the other.
The first was Teriarch. But he had not responded to her. His cave seemed…gone. Yet she needed his aid. She craved it. For a Dragon—where fae failed, perhaps the Dragon could help her.
And she would do whatever it took this time.
But the other road was longer still. More dangerous. She knew where the scroll Ivolethe and fate had led her to. Yet…it would be hard.
So that was why Ryoka Griffin played peacekeeper. Why she reassured Hethon they’d all get a turn—after dinner. And why she put up with Sammial. That—and she saw more than a bit of herself in them.
