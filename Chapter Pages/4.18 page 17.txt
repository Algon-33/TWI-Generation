“Remember that mountain we climbed over?”
“Yes. What of it?”
“I think…we shouldn’t have done that. According to this map, we’re not at Liscor.”
“We’re not?”
Venitra stared at Ijvani. The skeleton nodded.
“This…is Esthelm. Liscor is that way.”
She pointed. Venitra stared. She stared at Ijvani, the map, and then towards Liscor. She sighed. Ijvani looked at her.
“You really should have brought Kerash. He knows this continent far better than I do.”
“I brought you because you and Oom are our best trackers.”
Venitra’s face contorted into a scowl as she looked accusingly at Ijvani. The skeleton mage nodded.
“At tracking. But I need a quarry to locate them by magic. Oom needs a scent. We have neither. I’m not good at reading maps on the other hand, or signs. You’re supposed to be our master’s most competent creation. Why can’t you ever find where we’re going?”
Venitra shook her head.
“Shut up. We’re leaving.”
She started walking towards Liscor, her heavy tread cracking the earth. She’d gone ten feet when Ijvani called out after her.
“I lied. Liscor is that way.”
She pointed in the other direction. Venitra stopped, stared at Ijvani. Her tone was thick with malice.
“If you were not our master’s creation, I would destroy you right now.”
“You can try. I am the greatest skeleton to ever walk the earth. So my master designed me.”
She couldn’t argue with that. Venitra stomped towards Liscor. When she found that accursed Runner, she was going to rip her toes off one by one. To start with.
