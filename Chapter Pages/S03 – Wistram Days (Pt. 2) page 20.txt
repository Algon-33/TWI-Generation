“Ah, yes. I had a small infestation of mice in my room. This one must be a straggler.”
“Had?”
Pisces blinked.
“Have. Excuse me. I must have neglected to round up all of the vermin in my last sweep. It should be of no consequence.”
Ceria hesitated. She pointed to the dresser.
“Are you sure? One [Flame Jet] and they’re cooked. It’ll smell bad for a while, but—”
“I’m sure. I have my own methods of disposing of such creatures, and we mustn’t waste time. Let us go to dinner, and then we’ll begin the plan.”
He ushered her towards the door. Ceria nodded reluctantly, but she stopped Pisces as he closed the door to get ready.
“Just be sure it isn’t a rat. Mice will leave you alone, but some of the nastier kinds of rats will nibble your nose off as you sleep.”
“I have everything under control.”
Pisces shut the door as Ceria went back into her room to clean up in the few minutes before they left to eat. He breathed a sigh of relief, and then scowled as a small shape slowly climbed up his dresser.
He stared at it. The ‘rat’ stared back with hollow, unblinking eyes. It was no rat. It was a mouse. And it was dead.
Pisces raised a finger, and the mouse scurried over to him. He carefully picked it up and tucked it into the pocket of his robe. And then he opened the door and walked into the corridor.
“Ceria? Are you ready?”
“Coming—just got to stuff the feathers back in here.”
Ceria emerged from her room, blowing away some more feathers. She smiled at Pisces and his heart skipped a beat.
“Ready?”
“To dinner, then. And afterwards…”
“Let’s go grab a spellbook.”
