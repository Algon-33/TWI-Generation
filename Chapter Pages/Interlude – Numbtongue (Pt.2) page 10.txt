Interlude – Numbtongue (Pt.2)
Page 10
The Goblin turned his head and stared out his window at the city in the distance. Erin bit her lip hard. She didn’t know what to say. Numbtongue stared past her at Yellow Splatters. The Soldier raised a hand.
“If I am intruding, I will remove myself.”
Erin jumped. She hadn’t realized he was here. Numbtongue just laughed. He stared at Yellow Splatters, and a flicker of envy entered his eyes.
“You can go into Liscor. Do they stare at you there? Do they say things? Like…”
He gestured to the stairs. The Painted Soldier paused, his arms folded.
“They stare. But they stare everywhere. I have not been addressed like you are. I understand that you are banned from Liscor.”
“Yes. They close the gates before I can get in.”
The Hobgoblin clenched his fists, staring blackly ahead. Erin’s face fell.
“You went again? Why does it matter?”
“They died for Liscor. I can’t go in.”
Numbtongue’s claws dug into his flesh. Erin opened her mouth, but it was Yellow Splatters who tilted his head. The Soldier had been enjoying his conversation with Numbtongue. He felt a kinship to the Goblin. But this line of thought confused him.
“Why does it matter? Is the worth of Goblins—and their deaths—truly linked to your right to be in Liscor? Is that what they all died for?”
Erin gasped. Numbtongue’s eyes narrowed and he tensed. But then he looked at Yellow Splatters and, slowly, relaxed. For anyone else, the question might have stung. But Yellow Splatters returned the gaze calmly. And after a moment, Numbtongue blinked. The Hobgoblin exhaled and shook his head.
“It’s not about Liscor. We—the Redfangs, the Flooded Waters tribe didn’t fight for Liscor. We fought because the Goblin Lord was bad. Bad Goblin. And for you.”
He looked at Erin. And her face went pale. Numbtongue turned from her to Yellow Splatters. The Soldier nodded.
“We fought and died for Erin Solstice as well. As Pawn requested. This is a fact, and what I understood of Goblins. So why does access to Liscor matter?”
The young woman looked from Goblin to Antinium. And suddenly she was unsteady on her feet. Numbtongue shook his head. He pointed at Liscor.
“So they do not forget. So they cannot forget.”
And the pieces clicked. For Yellow Splatter, they fit together in a moment. It took Erin longer.
“Oh.”
She softly uttered the word. Numbtongue looked at her.
“They say Drakes saved the city. Or…they fought off the Humans. They forget. But I am here. We were here! They stop talking about Goblins! About the Redfangs, the Flooded Waters tribe. They forget. The ones in the city, who never come here. They forget. Why can I not remind them? Why can I not go there, when we all died—”
His voice trailed off. That was it. It wasn’t that he needed to be there. He probably didn’t even want to go. But it was that he couldn’t. To Yellow Splatters, it was like knowing there was sky. And never going above again.
The [Sergeant] considered the Hobgoblin standing across from him. He didn’t know what to say. Numbtongue’s pain wasn’t his own. His cause wasn’t Yellow Splatter’s. He did not matter to the Free Antinium. And still—the Soldier slowly uncrossed his arms.
“The Antinium fought the Goblin Lord for Liscor. So did the Goblins. To not say that is a lie. We died. And we were there.”
He touched his chest with one hand and pointed two. At Numbtongue, and at Erin. Her face was white. But the Goblin only nodded. He met Yellow Splatter’s gaze.
“They died. All of them. You. And me. My Chieftain. Headscratcher. Shorthilt. Spiderslicer. Noears. Reiss. Pyrite.”
