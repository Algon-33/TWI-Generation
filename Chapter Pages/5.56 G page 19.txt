Shiny? Rags peered into the sack. She saw something flash at her, despite the lack of light. She reached in and pulled out a glowing bit of blue quartz. It had…a mote of light that danced inside the crystalline structure. Rags stared at it. Then she heard Pyrite’s voice.
“Give.”
She looked up. He was dead. She had seen him die. He’d been hit by too many [Deathbolts]. But then how—? She handed the stone to him and Pyrite slowly lifted it to his mouth. He opened his jaws and let the glittering quartz fall into his mouth. Then he began to chew.
The sound he made was horrendous. Even Rags, who had eaten bark and dirt and bugs, winced. Pyrite chewed and chewed and then turned his head and spat. Blood and bits of quartz expectorated onto the ground. Rags stared at the shards. They were bloody. And the mote of light was gone.
“Give another.”
Pyrite’s voice was weak. Rags stared into the sack.
“No more.”
“No more? Bad.”
Pyrite wheezed. He lay there. She realized he was breathing, but faintly. His face was pale. But he was breathing. Could he really be…?
“How? How are you…”
Rags knelt over Pyrite. Now she remembered her healing potions and fumbled for them. Pyrite grunted weakly.
“Had stupid idea. Knew [Deathbolt] coming. Tried stupid thing.”
“What? What try?”
Pyrite groaned as Rags dumped a healing potion on his wounds. He must have used one already, because his wounds had been half-scabbed already.
“Shiny stones. Magic. Put in mouth. Thought could eat magic.”
Shiny stones? Rags remembered. Pyrite had his magic gemstones. She stared down at him.
“And?”
The Hob blinked reproachfully up at Rags.
“Think it worked. Tell me if I’m dead.”
She stared at him. And then, shakily, she laughed. Rags sat back and began to laugh. She heard a rumble. Pyrite chuckled. Rags lay on her back and giggled, then guffawed. She heard Pyrite laughing and the two of them laughed until it hurt and they were quiet. Then Rags wiped at her eyes. She kicked Pyrite in the stomach.
“Ow.”
“Don’t do again. Ever.”
“Won’t promise.”
The two sat there. Well, Pyrite lay on his back. Rags wiped at her eyes. After a while, Pyrite spoke.
“We lost.”
It wasn’t a question. Rags nodded.
“Yes. I…hid. Knew die if showed face. Reiss won. Tribe ran.”
“Okay.”
That was all Pyrite said. All he could say. Rags sat there, and buried her face in her hands. It was over. Pyrite lived, but her tribe was gone. She laughed again, but this time with bitter bile.
“I am stupidest, smallest, worst Chieftain ever.”
“And ugly.”
She kicked Pyrite again. She wanted to laugh. She wanted to cry. She just wanted to curl up next to Pyrite and sleep until she was dead. It was really over.
“All gone. I fail. Reiss wins.”
“Not over.”
Pyrite spoke insistently. Rags looked at him.
“You can’t move. I lost—wolf. Tribe. Crossbow.”
She looked around blankly for it. It was gone. Her beloved black crossbow was gone too. Somehow that hurt almost as much as the Carn Wolf. Rags patted her belt.
“And sword. And shield. And everything.”
She looked around the battlefield. Had someone torn it off her? Was it lying in the mud? It didn’t matter. Rags bowed her head.
“Lost everything. Have nothing.”
“Still have one. Me, Chieftain. Not done yet.”
Rags glared at Pyrite.
“What good is one Goblin? What good is stupid Chieftain without tribe?”
Pyrite was silent for a long moment. Then, slowly, he sat up. His body groaned and creaked with the effort. His face was pale as it rose, but he did rise. He looked at Rags, tired, weary. One foot in death. But he smiled and when he did, Rags thought the world seemed brighter.
