“We are only one group. We were founded around the [Prophet]. We are the People of Zeikhal, who can survive even in the great desert because we want not for water or mana.”
Mana as in…? Izreal continued.
“Our true name you will not understand until you hear it. But we are simply…”
He smiled, spoke, and Pisces’ ears rang. Somewhere else, five heads rose, and they looked hungrily towards that desert continent, guarded by that damned sword and light.
“Can you repeat that?”
Pisces rubbed at his ears. Izreal smiled.
“We are the People of God.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: It me. 24,000 words was not enough to split Pisces and Ceria. Frankly, I’d have liked to do it but…
I can’t. I’m running out of steam; an entire year’s worth of steam. I recharge every break, but it is a cumulative drain. I may have to take a longer break for the New Year’s as usual, but I intend to go until Volume 8 ends and then take a huge break.
However, I’ll try to keep quality up. If it dips, let me know. For now, part of that is keeping short-er chapters…like uh, Volume 6 length. Hope you understand.
There’s nothing else to talk about, clearly. Nothing important in this chapter aside from steam baths. If you scrolled down from the top, you can close the tab now and sleep easy.
…So uh, bye. Thanks for reading!
