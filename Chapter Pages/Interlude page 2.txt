Interlude

As one, the Goblins looked up. They saw a tall figure, half-naked, leap down towards them. On his back he carried a rusted weapon as tall as he was. A notched greatsword. And he had a beard, grey. He laughed as he appeared above Rags.
Greybeard. Greydath of Blades. The Goblin Lord looked down at the Goblins. His grin was wide. His eyes shone. Rags looked up at him. She was not surprised. She was beyond surprise. She had only grief in her. Grief, and anger.
“You.”
“Me.”
Greydath agreed. He leapt down and stood in front of Rags. There was no apology in his eyes. He looked around at the others, clearly counting. Then he shrugged.
It was that shrug which made the fury in Rags rise, loud enough to drown the sorrow. She saw Snapjaw stir. Saw Rabbiteater and Badarrow look up with sudden, furious recognition. Redscar pointed.
“You. You are Goblin Lord.”
“I am.”
He did not deny it. Greydath watched as the Goblins stirred. They looked at him. But they felt nothing. Rags sensed nothing from the Hobgoblin. It was as if he were a ghost. Not a Goblin. Certainly not a Goblin Lord.
“You saw it all.”
Redscar looked at Greydath. It was not a question. Greydath nodded.
“I saw it.”
“You did nothing?”
Rags whispered. Greydath glanced at her.
“Should I?”
The small Goblin had no answer for that. She just stared. But another Hobgoblin moved. Snapjaw drew her sword. She pointed it at Greydath.
“You! You let him die!”
“Reiss?”
Greydath shrugged. It was too much. Snapjaw lunged, sword swinging. Greydath moved. His arm blurred and he blocked Snapjaw’s blade with his greatsword. The sound rang in the night. Snapjaw staggered back. Greydath turned. Rabbiteater had the magical axe in his hands. He was staring at Greydath with hatred. So was Badarrow. The Goblin had an arrow pointed at Greydath’s chest.
“You coward. You did nothing! You let him die! He was Goblin Lord! Like you!”
Snapjaw screamed. She tried to bite at Greydath, but he dodged her. The Goblin Lord threw Snapjaw back. He was still smiling.
“So? He fought.”
“Garen died.”
Redscar’s voice was quiet. He lifted Redfang and Greydath’s eyes flicked to him. The other Goblins were getting up. The Goblin Lord looked calmly at the three Redfangs.
“He chose to. He could have run. He was a traitor. Reiss, a slave. What of it?”
The words made the Goblins furious. They slowly advanced and Greydath waited. His smile was mocking. Designed to infuriate. But Rags did not draw the shortsword at her side. She looked at Greydath’s face.
“Pyrite is dead. You taught him.”
For a second she saw Greydath’s smile flicker. But then the Goblin Lord turned to her.
“So what? He was a Hobgoblin. One Hobgoblin.”
“It doesn’t matter to you that he died?”
Greydath tilted his head back and forth. He stared past Rags, into the dark sky. Then he shook his head.
“Goblins die.”
That was it. It was too much. Poisonbite leapt at the same time the Redfangs swung. Greydath spun. All four Goblins stumbled back. He laughed at them.
“Is that all? Is that all you can do? This is why they died. Because you are weak. And you. You failed them all. You could stop nothing. Just run.”
Greydath pointed at Rags. She felt the words go through her. She stared at Greydath. Hurt and pain and anger welled up and her. And then it vanished. She felt a calm cold settle over her. A certainty. She looked into Greydath’s eyes and saw none of the mockery in his voice. Slowly, Rags shook her head.
“Why are you doing this?”
The Goblin Lord hesitated. Then he shrugged.
“To tell you that you are weak. To make you angry.”
“Is that why you waited? To tell me this?”
