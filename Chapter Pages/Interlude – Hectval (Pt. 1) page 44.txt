Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 1)
Page 44
Embria had felt that a few times in battle. She waited, riding back and forth, as 4th Company watched her uncertainly.
“Wing Commander. We going in or…?”
Lieutenant Kesa began, but Captain Vell snapped at her.
“Shut up. There’s something in the air.”
She felt it too. Embria saw the [Soldiers] fighting the Antinium moving backwards. Once more, the massed voices of the [Crusaders] hummed in the air. Embria heard it.
…the sky. The…
Wrath and righteous fury. It made her scales tingle uncomfortably.
Hectval was pressed up against Liscor’s army, and Liscor was refusing to flinch. The alliance’s forces looked like they were going to break. Embria, watching the [Crusaders] fight, saw a strange group emerging from the retreating [Soldiers], disobeying their officer’s orders to keep fighting.
A panicked Drake was stumbling backwards when another [Soldier] knocked them aside. This Gnoll was bent over, hunched, and knocked another [Soldier] out of the way with his free arm.
He didn’t break stride. He was moving through Hectval’s ranks with a number of other [Soldiers], all of whom had a certain glitter about their armor that made Embria focus on them with alarm.
“Wing Commander! The left flank!”
“I see it, Maksie. 4th, on me!”
Embria began to ride towards that spot. Olesm was speaking into her earpiece.
“What have you seen? Scout Leader?”
How could either one describe it? It was something about the way those [Soldiers] moved. Too confidently. People were dying around them, and they were just alert, not panicking. They didn’t break formation, even with other [Soldiers] shoving them.
They had enchanted gear. Then, Embria saw their leader.
She picked him out like any other officer could have picked her out. He wasn’t at the front of the formation, but he led them. A Gnoll in black armor, stalking along with a spear held low.
That’s a [Spearmaster].
The [Spear Hunter] realized it in a flash. He had nearly reached the Antinium’s front lines. About three ranks separated his group of strange [Soldiers] from theirs, and the Antinium were calmly fighting. They had no idea—
“Tersk! Dekass! Elites incoming! [Spearmaster]!”
Embria shouted into her speaking stone. She saw the Antinium lines changing, maneuvering to bring their veterans to bear, angling their bows and crossbows down.
Too late. The [Spearmaster] saw the movement. He raised his paw and shouted something. Around him, the [Soldiers] charged. They knocked down the alliance’s forces in front of them. The Antinium in the front ranks looked up and saw the new threat coming.
The Gnoll shot past the others. Embria saw his spear raised, aiming at the first rank of [Crusaders] who pivoted, steel armor and shields gleaming.
Wrath. Perish.
Embria rode at the Gnoll, 4th Company accelerating.
“Skills! Now!”
Vell, Pielt, and Embria all began using their Skills to make the [Soldiers] following them as strong as could be. They were going to miss the first attack, but Embria was galloping now, racing ahead of the others.
“[Daring Charge]! [Piercing Arms]!”
“[First Strikes]! [Formation: Accelerate]!”
“[Blades of Glory]!”
The Gnoll reached the Antinium lines. Embria saw him jump. Jump? Why—
She saw his spear twist in the air. The glittering red tip of metal and dark shaft of ashwood twisted in the air. Curving impossibly, the spear’s tip striking down.
For a second, Embria saw something like a giant beast’s fang slice through the air. Left—right. So fast she nearly missed it.
Like a flash of lightning, it went through the Antinium in front of the Gnoll. One rank, two—
