After the silly song, the sudden change in music was as discordant as someone smacking two rocks together. The Free Queen sighed.
“Little Bird.”
“Yes?”
The Free Queen bent. In her cavernous chamber, her massive form bent down, to the little Worker lying on his back. The Free Queen inspected him with one huge eye.
“I have heard that song before. The song is Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. From a…play called The Nutcracker.”
“Yes.”
“I have a question.”
“Okay.”
Bird waited. The Free Queen sighed again.
“There are no faeries or sugar in your song, Bird. Just a song about a nutcracker who cracks nuts and kills birds by using them as bait. Why?”
“I do not know. I made up the words myself.”
“Ah.”
The Free Queen stared down at Bird. He stared back up at her. The Free Queen’s mandibles opened.
“I have many questions.”
“I have no answers.”
“I see. You may stop singing. I have heard enough for now.”
“Okay.”
Bird happily rocked back and forth. The Free Queen stared at him. One of Bird’s legs was pushing him off the ground, rocking him on his beetle-shell back. His regrowing limbs waved happily. They were rapidly regrowing. And Bird was animated. Perhaps too much. The Free Queen sighed, but without any rancor. She turned and her thoughts grew pensive.
For she was the Free Queen. And while Bird’s music was a welcome distraction, Klbkch’s messages to her reminded her of her duty. She turned her head and raised her voice.
“Bird. Garry. Come here.”
From out of the private kitchen an Antinium Worker appeared. Garry the [Cook] in charge of the Free Queen’s meals scurried out, looking distressed.
“My Queen, I am afraid your snack is not ready—”
“It is fine. Leave it. Approach. You too, little Bird.”
Garry nodded and came forwards to halt, staring up at his Queen. Bird rolled over until he was lying in front of the Free Queen. She looked down at them.
“Bird. Garry. I am about to speak of a subject of utmost importance to the Hive. You two will respond to the best of your abilities.”
The two Workers looked up at her. Bird slowly stopped rocking. Garry stood straighter.
“Yes, my Queen.”
“Good. Then listen. Garry. Bird. I tested you, once before. To see if you were worthy of being True Antinium. You failed.”
Garry’s antennae quivered. Bird opened his mandibles.
“I remember that. Pawn was very sad.”
The Free Queen looked down blankly at him.
“Was he? It may be an appropriate reaction. But do you recall the nature of the test?”
“I…recall some of it, my Queen. But I do not remember all of it.”
Garry slowly took off the chef’s hat he had been allowed to buy. Bird wiggled his antennae.
“No.”
“I asked you what the purpose of the Antinium was. Recall your answers.”
Bird hesitated. He looked up at the Free Queen.
“Was it…something about birds?”
“Yes. And it was incorrect. Garry. Do you recall what Bird does not?”
The Free Queen looked at Garry. The Worker hesitated. Then he spoke in a clear voice, trembling slightly.
“I do, my Queen. We answered, each in turn. Belgrade answered that it was to defend and protect the Hive. Anand believed it was to level up and serve the Hive in that way. Pawn thought it was to…be better. That fewer would die. Bird thought it was to eat birds. I—I asked if it was to replicate and create more Hives. Is that the answer, my Queen?”
“No.”
The response was flat. Cold. Garry flinched under it. Bird just stared up. The Queen looked down on them. And the pleasant music that Bird had sung was a distant memory. Now she was pensive. Thinking deeply. And unhappy. Both Bird and Garry could see that in her.
