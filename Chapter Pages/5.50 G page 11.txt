Reiss glanced between Pyrite and Tremborag with interest. Garen frowned. It seemed like a distraction, but Rags could see how Pyrite’s left foot tensed up as he stared calmly at Tremborag.
“You were in my tribe.”
The Great Chieftain insisted. Pyrite nodded at last.
“Small Goblin. No name.”
“Yes. A worthless little Goblin. But for some reason—”
Tremborag peered at Pyrite. Then his huge eyes widened.
“Now I remember! You were with him all the time. That decrepit old Hob. Grey…Greybeard! Yes, that was it! That useless fool and you were always together. Where is that traitor? Dead?”
All the Goblins in Rags’ tribe stirred. They looked at each other and then at Pyrite. Redscar sat up and stared hard at Pyrite. All of Rags’ lieutenants and Rags herself remembered. And Reiss sat up too. Snapjaw was poking Eater of Spears urgently and the huge Hob was nodding. Garen sat bolt-upright, his eyes widening as he realized who Tremborag was mentioning.
Only Tremborag himself didn’t notice. Pyrite glanced around and seemed to sigh. He nodded.
“True. I was with Greybeard. But not right name. He had another.”
“Oh yes?”
Tremborag smirked. He opened his wineskin with one claw.
“What was it? Was he an old Chieftain from another tribe? A wanderer who stole his name like the child? What did he call himself?”
“Greydath of Blades.”
The wineskin slipped from Tremborag’s claws. It landed on the ground, leaking wine. Tremborag stared at Pyrite.
“Do not lie.”
“No lie.”
Pyrite met Tremborag’s gaze. The Great Chieftain drew himself up to shout, and then, at last, caught the mood around the camp. The Goblins in his tribe stared at Reiss’ face, at Rags’ expression, at Garen and the other Hobs.
They knew. Rags remembered the grinning Hob with the grey beard. Tremborag’s jaw worked soundlessly.
Perhaps if he was Human he might have denied it. But Goblins seldom lied, let alone to each other. And the truth was written on every face. The Great Chieftain’s face changed from shock to fury to confusion and a host of other emotions as he tried to process that information. Then, at last, he croaked.
“Greydath? But he died—”
Pyrite nodded amiably. He fished around in his pile of bones for a new one. Looking unconcerned at all the eyes on him, he cracked another bone and hunted for the marrow.
“True. Greydath died in war. Probably like Necromancer. Probably was just imposter. All he had was rusty greatsword. Didn’t do much. Ate. Slept. Worked. Cut Griffon in half. Go poo. Talked. Taught me.”
“So that was Greydath who visited my tribe?”
Reiss stared hard at Pyrite. The Hob looked up and met his eyes. He shrugged at the Goblin Lord, which was incredible in itself.
“Maybe? Old Goblin? Beard? Cackle like this?”
Pyrite made a good attempt at Greydath’s crackling laughter. Reiss hesitated.
“He spoke to—what did he want? What did he teach you?”
Every eye was fixed on Pyrite. The Hob seemed reluctant to speak. He looked around, saw Garen’s burning gaze on him, scratched his butt, and then shrugged again.
“Names of rocks. Edible moss. Good bugs to eat. Bad bugs to eat. How to poo smart. How to make tweezers for splinters.”
Rags stared at Pyrite slack-jawed. Then her eyes narrowed. His ears were twitching slightly. She reached over to punch him in the side. The Hob blocked her fist effortlessly. He paused. Tremborag was glaring at him, as were the others. Pyrite sighed again.
“How small we are. How strong Humans are. What it means to be Chieftain. And…stories.”
“Stories?”
Redscar stared hard at Pyrite. The Hob nodded.
