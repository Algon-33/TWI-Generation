“I don’t see your little Gnoll. Perhaps she’d hiding in the inn?”
“Mrsha! We’re not mad! Come back!”
“Yeah! Whoever you are! Who are we looking for?”
Saliss glanced about. For all he joked, he was peering about. More people came out of the inn. Palt was next.
“Let me trot this way. Maybe she’s running about—”
He began circling the inn. Montressa and Beza appeared. Eager to help out.
“Maybe she’s in the inn?”
“No, there was only one way out besides the door. The window.”
“Did the Antinium see anything?”
More people. Olesm got up. And even Chaldion came to the door.
“What’s this about?”
“The Gnoll—Mrsha. Chaldion, use your eye.”
Grimalkin sighed. The [Grand Strategist] shrugged. He opened his eye patch and to Lyonette’s horror, pulled out the blue gemstone and replaced it with a white one. It was clouded, but it glowed as Chaldion tapped it.
“[Scrying]. Mrsha. Last name?”
“Mrsha of the Stone Spears Tribe. That’s all we know.”
“Hm. I don’t think that will be enough. I’ll scry this area.”
The Drake sighed. He leaned on his cane as the others spread out. Palt decided to run down the hill, check some of the valleys out of sight. Grimalkin leapt down the hill and did likewise.
“This is pointless. Ishkr? Ishkr, can you get Mrsha’s scent?”
Lyonette went back into the inn. Ishkr obligingly sniffed the room where Mrsha had gone. But then he wrinkled his nose.
“I can’t find a new trail. Sorry, I’m no [Tracker]. Does she have a Skill?”
“Yes! At least one. But she can’t have gone far.”
“She’s fast. Gnoll cubs can sprint far. And if she was worried—let’s see. You took about one minute? And if she was still running out of sight—”
Grimalkin was doing a quick calculation. He glanced about. Erin shook her head.
“Mrsha’s not gone far. I’m sure of it.”
“How sure?”
Lyonette stared at Erin. The [Innkeeper] opened and closed her mouth and frowned.
“…Let’s search.”
No one worried. It was one Gnoll cub. And Chaldion would find her. Until he didn’t. The Drake announced he couldn’t locate Mrsha anywhere around the inn.
So they searched the inn. Numbtongue, sitting in his room, embarrassed, was confronted by Erin and Lyonette throwing open his door.
“Is Mrsha in here? Numbtongue, we’re not mad—”
The Hobgoblin stared at them. He was embarrassed—but one look at their faces made him shake his head. Erin looked at him, smiling with a hint of worry. He stood up.
“What happened?”
“Oh, Mrsha ran off. She broke a cake. We’re not mad—we just want to find her.”
“She’s not in the inn?”
The Hobgoblin looked at the two young women. Lyonette shook her head.
“She’s probably hiding. She jumped out a window. She might have hidden—”
“The basement.”
“Of course!”
The two young women hurried out of the room. Numbtongue stared around. He checked under his bed. He followed the two as they went into Erin’s new basement.
Mrsha was not there. But that was fine. The two young women assured Numbtongue he could go back to his room. Someone would have seen her from the walls of Liscor.
By this point, Garia Strongheart, the City Runner was helping search. And everyone else in the inn. Fals jogged back after having run ten minutes one way. Palt was coming back, having done the same. Numbtongue looked at Garia.
“Hi.”
“Hi. Little Mrsha’s gone, right?”
He nodded slowly. But there was nothing to fear.
Until the [Guards] on Liscor’s walls reported to Olesm they hadn’t seen a white Gnoll. And then—Numbtongue saw Erin and Lyonette’s faces. They conferred with Chaldion and Grimalkin.
And Numbtongue began to worry.
