The two went back to breakfast. Erin glared at her food. She didn’t have a plan, actually. But something had to be done! Olesm’s betrayal was—okay, she felt bad about badmouthing Lism. Family was family. But still!
“Grr. Wow. These hard boiled goose eggs are good. Why have I eaten only chicken eggs all my life? Grr.”
Numbtongue nodded amiably. Erin growled into her plate. Selys and Krshia had both tried to come up with a solution, but Selys had been too upset and Krshia too furious to think rationally. Their team—Elirr, Raekea, the other Gnolls that Krshia had been hoping to put on the Council—had disbanded in low spirits yesterday. And Zevara hadn’t shown up.
“They gave her a good deal. So she’s not all on Selys’ side. Gotta think of something. But the Walled Cities are funding Lism. That Olesm. That’s smart. Jerk move, but smart.”
Numbtongue licked his plate. Erin tapped her hand on the table.
“You know what? We’re not done. Selys was planning on having Zevara wear the Heartflame Breastplate. Fat chance of that now. But there’s something…and it’s not like the Gnolls don’t have good candidates. People like Krshia. And Raekea, that [Armorer]. I didn’t know there were Gnoll [Blacksmiths], did you, Numbtongue?”
“Yes. They probably have fire-resistance Skills.”
The [Bard] strummed gently on his guitar, quietly to avoid waking the guests. Erin looked up at him.
“That’s a thing?”
“Mhm. Very nice Skills. Hard to get. Goblins like to have them. Especially in Garen’s tribe.”
“Why?”
“So we can lay traps with exploding fire or spells and not worry about it. A Goblin stands on a trap with lots of wood. And oil. Angry Gargoyles attack him. Or adventurers. The Goblin sets off the trap and gets away. No one else.”
“Oh. Cool?”
“Not very.”
Numbtongue’s teeth flashed. Erin blinked, and then laughed despite herself. He was telling jokes! Sometimes she forgot how good Numbtongue was with words. And not just for a Goblin; she supposed that was why he was a [Bard].
“Right. Well, I know I can do some things. But I want to make a huge impact, you know? I was fine with Krshia being on the Council, but now it’s personal. I have to help. I can get a lot of attention. But is that enough?”
“No?”
“Exactly. Thank you, Numbtongue. You’re always honest.”
“Got any more fish?”
“In the kitchen.”
Erin thought as the Goblin got up. She was restless, drumming her fingers on the table. It was unusual for her. Usually she was as placid as Numbtongue in the morning. But today? It felt like someone had poked her head from the inside. Now Erin was lighting up. She was mad.
“Erin.”
The young woman looked up as the Hobgoblin poked his head out of the kitchen. She focused on what he was holding. Numbtongue grinned hopefully.
“Cake?”
“How’d you find—no cake! I thought I hid that!”
Erin glared. Numbtongue sighed. He patted his stomach.
“I’m hungry.”
“And Mrsha’s coming downstairs in a minute. If you have it, she’ll want some. No cake.”
The Hobgoblin sighed. He put the cake back and came out with the rest of the fish on his plate. Erin went back to staring at her plate. Absently, she felt for the knife on her belt.
“Olesm. I could stab him. With my knife.”
Numbtongue looked at Erin. She raised her hands.
“Hey! I’m just brainstorming. No ideas are off the table. I’m just really mad at him. I know his heart’s in the right place. I wouldn’t stab him too hard. Lism, now…I suppose he’d spin that too.”
