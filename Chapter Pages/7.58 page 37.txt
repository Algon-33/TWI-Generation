Aaron stared at Ryoka. He had heard her voice. And remembered. The [Mages] turned. Ryoka’s hair streamed behind her. Saliss of Lights ran behind them as Maviola’s voice sang out again.
“I have given my life for Izril! My brother fell defending our home and I have carried his memory in me! I burned our foes to ash! My House has given its lives a hundred, a thousand thousand times to defend this land! I did not spend every year and second of my life to see my home fall to rot and cowardice!”
Her words stirred her listeners. Maviola raised the banner higher. Her hair, her eyes, were igniting. The banner was glowing. Maviola shouted.
“Rise, for the House of El! Wake, stone! Rage, listeners! For pride and justice!”
The banner burst into flame. It burned like gold. Like a dying life. Maviola lifted it.
“To arms! Deliver the cure to the House of Veltras! I call you to take up arms! Rally, for the honor of the Five Families! For Izril, ride with me!”
Her words rang. Ryoka’s head rose. She saw Saliss laughing. Erin Solstice looked after Maviola as her gold fire burned. Her glory.
“Oh.”
Erin Solstice had known every person she had summoned. Every guest of her inn, however temporary. She had called them all, and begged every favor she couldn’t repay. Now—Maviola was doing the same.
And she had lived a century on these lands. Her enemies and friends heard her cry. And the Circle’s spell of [Fear]—
Ended.

Ryoka Griffin rode with Maviola El and Saliss. The [Assassins] poured down the road, striving to keep up with the three. [Haste] spells allowed them to match the speed of the others.
“They’re gaining—”
“Not for long.”
Saliss tossed a potion behind him coated with a levitation tonic. It hovered, like a landmine in the air—detonated.
The [Assassins] dodged out of the way. The [Alchemist] cursed.
“I hate dodgers! Get ready—”
The first Face aimed a bow as he rode at Ryoka. She conjured the wind and a whirlwind of sand out of her bag of holding. It covered the [Assassins] and they choked, swearing.
Saliss tossed three potions. They didn’t dodge these ones.
“Nice!”
“Ahead! Watch the front!”
Maviola threw fire—but the coach’s walls resisted the glowing blue fire. Ryoka turned her bike. Saliss took aim. They would not stop! They would not fail to deliver this cure.
Not one was a Courier. Couriers had failed. But—the [Alchemist] webbed the wheels of the first coach and it skidded to a stop. Ryoka dumped caltrops in the way of the [Assassins] trying to follow on foot. Maviola ignited the grass behind them, leaving a trail of fire.
The entire Guild was after them. The Circle of Thorns, fighting to hold onto Izril’s heart.
But Ryoka Griffin was not alone. Saliss, Maviola—the Wind Runner looked ahead.
“They’re gaining again! They must be overdosing on [Haste] potions or using Skills! They’ll tear their muscles off their bones. Right after they kill us!”
Saliss cursed. Ryoka shouted.
“Keep going!”
“They’re about to get us!”
“Keep going!”
The Drake turned. He ran past a braced figure on the ground. The Drake met the Human’s eyes for a moment.
“Silver Swords—charge!”
Ylawes burst upwards. His shield caught a charging [Assassin] on horseback. The figure went flying.
“[Champion’s Throw]!”
Dawil hurled an axe through the wheels of a carriage; the blade didn’t stop until it was embedded in the earth. He lifted his hammer.
“Falene!”
“[Acid Orb], [Lightning Bolt], [Arrows of Stone], [Forcewall]—”
The [Battlemage] unleashed her best volley of spells.
“Ylawes!”
Ryoka turned in her seat. The [Knight] raised his sword.
“The House of Byres! Go, Lady El!”
