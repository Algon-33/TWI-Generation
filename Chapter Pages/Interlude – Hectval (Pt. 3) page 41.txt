Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 3)

“You are Wing Commander Embria, aren’t you? Do you want some? We are going.”
“You don’t have orders for that.”
A figure moved through the darkness, and something glittered as it rose. Embria looked up and saw a familiar flag glowing in the night. Arrows swerved around her as a Worker lifted it higher, staring at what they held.
Artur. He turned to face Embria.
“I order it. Squad 2, Battalion 6. Prepare to charge. There is no strategy in it. But we will break their lines or fall.”
They were going for Pawn. Embria hesitated, looking down. She could hear Manus’ [Soldiers] shouting, roaring—but there was something different this time. They sounded—determined.
 
——
 
[Lineholders]. [War Veterans]. [Vanguards].
Manus’ [Soldiers] had been replenished, their numbers doubled. The new lot were ready to slaughter the Antinium. It was the group that had fought them these last two months who held them back. Told them something like what Embria had said.
These are not the Antinium you know.
Now, one of their [Captains] was waiting to get to the front. The Antinium were fighting, trying to stop Lulv as he advanced on that Worker and the Painted Antinium. Yet—
The Workers and Soldiers were waiting for Manus as their lines closed. The ones behind the engaged front ranks? The [Captain] muttered.
“What was that, sir?”
A [Soldier] looked at him. The [Captain] said it again. The Drake hesitated and reached for his speaking stone.
“Strategist Sokkel, sir. Report.”
“What?”
The [Strategist] snapped. The [Captain] hesitated. He said it again.
“…They looked like [Soldiers].”
“What? Have you taken leave of your senses? Get off the—”
Sokkel was bawling the [Captain] off until he realized what that meant. The Manus [Captain] didn’t know how to explain it.
They looked like [Soldiers]. They were standing shoulder-to-shoulder, fixated. Not pushing forwards, waiting. One of them held their mace grimly, and another was aiming his zweihander.
If I die, I will take you with me. They had always been Antinium. Lulv hadn’t taken anyone who mocked the Antinium’s ability to kill. Manus had taken them seriously. We know you are warriors.
These were [Soldiers]. There was a difference. The Antinium squad charged as some of their own fell back. Fell back to preserve their lives. Not a mindless attack until they died, like Dekass had first ordered.
 
——
 
“Squad 5, charge!”
They charged. Crusader 53’s mace met an enchanted shield, and the Drake holding it buckled.
Faith. Pawn was among them. He could not die. Squad 5 fought like lions. Too bad they were fighting Manticores.
“You iDiOt—”
Crusader 57 went down as Crusader 51—no, Toni—slipped, and a [Soldier] tried to run him through. The Worker charged into the way of the partisan spear. He fell back, and the Gnoll tried to tear the spear upwards.
Crusader 53 hit him on the head. The Gnoll’s head imploded. The [Soldiers] of Manus reacted as the mace crushed an enchanted helmet.
“High-level [Soldier]! Watch it!”
The Soldier whirled his mace up. It flashed, and a [Captain] turned pale.
“Oh shit. Mace arts. Take—”
A Soldier with two arms and battered steel armor lifted the mace up and rotated. Like a spinning top. The mace swung around—and then it was as big as a battering ram. A cluster of [Soldiers] vanished as it hit them like a gong.
“High-level Antinium! Mark it! Mark—”
The [Captain]’s last words were choked off by a crunch. Crusader 53’s mace smashed through the squad, scattering those who survived like pins.
[Mace Art: Big Hammer].
But he was marked.

“This is Aerial Team 1. We’re heading down.”
