“Close ranks around his Majesty! [Steel Curtain Formation]!”
Commander Ytol roared. The Rustängmarder seemed to merge. Emile’s forces slammed into them, unable to get past.
“My turn. [Trick Riders]—now. Warden Winta!”
The River Warden raised her wand. She aimed it up. The Rustängmarder braced, ready to block or even deflect a [Fireball]. But it wasn’t that. She pointed. And shouted a word as the [Trick Riders] abandoned their [King].
“[Step of Light]!”
Raelt Leysars of Jecrass saw the foothold appear in midair. He stood on his horse’s back as it was about to hit the press of bodies. And leapt.
“[Flash Step].”
The [King of Challenges] landed on the platform in the air. He vanished. Flos Reimarch’s head twisted.
Past the wall of the Rustängmarder, Raelt landed. Amid [Soldiers]. They twisted, seeing the [King]. He stabbed a [Soldier] through the face.
“Defend his Majesty!”
Both sides shouted it. Raelt heard a whoop and saw a [Trick Rider] land.
“[Flying Hooves]!”
The [Soldiers] went flying as more [Trick Riders] landed past the Rustängmarder, creating an opening. The [Soldiers] closed in; the elite [Riders] went down to thrusting spears. Raelt saw a woman slash around her with a spear, clearing a gap before they ran her through.
Dying, dying. To create an opening. Raelt saw it appear and dodged the slashing blades. He wove left, vanishing, blurring. [Evasive Leap] carried him left—
And there he was. The King of Destruction looked down at the King of Duels.
“Raelt of Jecrass. You’ve pushed too far in. You are alone.”
The King of Destruction’s bodyguards pushed forwards. Raelt nodded. He saw the River Wardens fighting forwards, trying to reach him. The [King of Challenges] flicked his rapier up and aimed it at Flos.
“I’m aware. But I’m tired. I’d rather like to finish this, Flos of Reim.”
“I’m not in the mood for a duel. I think you cheat.”
The King of Destruction’s eyes glinted. He motioned his bodyguard to the sides, moving to encircle Raelt.
“Although I’d be interested in taking you alive, I’m rather more practical than that. If you were hoping for a duel, Raelt—”
He stopped as Raelt dodged a sudden thrust from the side. He ran the Rustängmarder [Death Soldier] through the gap in his visor. Raelt pulled the blade back. His parrying dagger was in the other hand. He looked at the King of Destruction.
“I wasn’t.”
Something chimed softly in the battle. A golden bell. The [Fencer] stood, looking left and right at the King of Destruction’s bodyguard. Flos Reimarch stared. And then he laughed.
“Well said.”
He rode forwards as Raelt Leysars bowed.

“Oh wow. Oh wow.”
Drassi was so distracted she forgot she was on air. She was peering at the picture with everyone else. She jumped as someone coughed.
“I-I think this is it. The King of Duels has now engaged the King of Destruction and his bodyguard in combat. Ancestors. He’s going to die—”
She watched Raelt stagger as someone tried to run him through. Only his enchanted armor saved him. He turned, hacking, as the King of Destruction turned his mount for another pass. He had an axe and shield up. Drassi looked around desperately.
“Are we recording this? Are we recording this? Someone tell everyone!”
Her shouting was audible in The Wandering Inn. Mrsha looked up from her ‘grand apology and niceness tour’. Maviola El stood up and strode for the scrying orb and crowd. Erin Solstice drifted over. She hadn’t really seen the King of Destruction before. War wasn’t something she wanted to watch. She heard an exclamation.
