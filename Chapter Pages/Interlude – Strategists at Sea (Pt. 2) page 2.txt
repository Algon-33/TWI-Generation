“But I still offer this bargain out of the mortality I remember. Gratitude. For acts of daring, for luck, for these things should be rewarded. Now. Tell me, Dwarf.”
He leaned down. Merrik stared up at the glowing eyes.
“Do you wish to bargain with me? For I am no [Merchant].”
Merrik raised his hands. He grinned, backing up, as the chest lowered itself to the deck.
“No, your Majesty. Please excuse my impertinence. I’ve a tongue on me. Too chatty by far. That’s what the old grandfathers used to say.”
“It is excused, Dwarf.”
The [King] shrank back down. He looked from face to face. Now, curiously.
“A Terandrian [Lord]. A Dwarf. A Selphid, a son of the House of Minos, a Plains Gnoll. And a Garuda. Do you hail from Chandrar, girl?”
He looked at Peki. The [Martial Artist] bowed, in a different style. A warrior’s salute.
“I come from Pomle.”
“Ah. How did such a group come searching for my treasure?”
Fetohep turned to Wil. The young [Lord] replied, trying to explain.
“We’re…students of the Titan of Baleros, Niers Astoragon, your Majesty. And we…”
The undead [King]’s eyes flickered at the Titan’s name. And he smiled—although his emaciated face was always smiling.
“I see. Youthful adventure. Then, thank your luck, young Kallinad. You have the right of choosing of the Swords of Serept. If you choose, choose wisely; each one is different. If not…I shall return in one day’s time. Give me your answer then.”
He raised a hand before Wil could respond, and his form collapsed into sand. The sand blew off the side of the ship, and into the sea. And then—only the diamond swords remained. Wil stared, wide-eyed, around at the others.
It had been such a quick encounter. And yet—his mind was spinning. Venaz exhaled slowly.
“He could have blasted our flesh from our bones. What was that? Some kind of astral projection spell. And yet, the power. Wil, you didn’t tell me the chest was cursed.”
He gave Wil a vaguely reproachful look. Wil weakly spoke.
“I didn’t think it was worth mentioning. Even the Professor’s notes said it was unlikely to be the actual treasure…”
He looked at a [Storm Sailor] standing to the side. Inky’s eyes were wide. As awed as the other’s. She looked at him.
“It was just sitting there. In a pile of bones. Was that undead a…ruler of Khelt?”
“The Kingdom of Undead. Ruled by nigh-immortal monarchs. A beauteous place, or so it’s said. For the few that enter. Never conquered; even the King of Destruction struck a deal rather than invade.”
Lasc murmured. He shook himself. And stared at Wil, purely shocked. The swords glittered in the chest. A black dagger, a green diamond greatsword. A rose blade, with only one edge. A yellow longsword…
Magic. Treasure. Relics. Relic-class artifacts. Wil felt light-headed.
“This isn’t happening. Yerra? Pinch me.”
“I’m trying. But it’s not working on me. But if I feel something, I know I’m dreaming. Dead gods. Dead gods—we found something.”
The Selphid was pinching her dead flesh. Feshi was sniffing the air, wide-eyed.
“We found them? Just—lying there? What will you do, Wil? Take the offer, surely? But would not someone steal them?”
“Fetohep might object. But maybe he only knows where the blades are. How strong’s the curse? How…am I dreaming?”
Wil murmured weakly. He looked around. His friends were gazing at him. The [Sailors] were murmuring. But it was a different kind of awe than seeing the Treant.
Treasure. Wil felt it tugging at him. But he had to know. He reached for one arm, and hesitated.
“Peki? Hit me.”
The Garuda turned her head. She nodded. Merrik’s head snapped around.
“No, wait. Peki, don’t actually—”
