Ryoka went flying as a second hand appeared. Eldavin stared as Tyrion glanced up, the hands vanished, and the [Lord] went charging after her.
“Trace that spell! [Featherfall]!”
He cast through the spell as he roared. Ryoka’s downward momentum slowed to a crawl; the wind had already been arresting it. The other [Mages] scrambled to re-cast spells, hone in on…
What?
“I…I don’t sense any mana whatsoever. A trace of it…it’s like grasping at fog.”
Telim spoke uncertainly. A [Warlock] was muttering.
“Not even…there it is again! Dead gods!”
The sky opened up.
“You little wretch! Do you think you can escape?”
Eldavin heard the voice. He saw another bolt of lightning stabbing down. His multiple detection spells barely pinged. The other [Mages] were slack-jawed.
“It’s like invisible magic.”
“Don’t just stand there. Cast—”
A barrier opened up in the sky and the red lightning cracked against it. Eldavin recognized Valeterisa’s magic. Her excited voice was in his ears as his lips moved soundlessly, casting with increasing speed.
“Almost no magical residue. I cannot tell how they are hiding the origin—can you, Grand Magus?”
“It’s…not a scrying spell.”
The half-Elf whispered. The other [Mages] turned.
“What?”
“They’re not casting through a [Scrying] spell. That’s why we can’t trace the magic.”
They should have been able to see exactly where the spells were coming from, like someone following a string back to the source. But there was no direct [Scrying] spell pumping the other spells through, like Wistram was doing. That was why everyone from the [Mages] here to Jericha were as oblivious to the magic as Sir Leireit, the [Sorcerer].
And also because this spellcasting is adept. It’s…as good as mine. Eldavin himself could barely sense the spells as they materialized. A second bolt of red lighting shot down. Valterisa conjured a barrier from her location. The lightning curved around it, but Tyrion was there and blocked it again. A curse rang through the air.
I barely saw the adjustment to that spell.
“Then how are they aiming?”
Telim and the other [Mages] were miles behind Eldavin’s conclusions. He snapped, absently.
“Coordinates. They’re calculating each spell rather than reveal through the [Scrying] spell. Shut up—I have to—[Sylph Spark]. Bound to a counter…”
He called deeply on his mana reserves, and the links. A flashing light appeared. It flickered up—
“Who dares?”
A shock ran through Eldavin’s mind. At the same time, he heard the voice, sensed a shock like his own. In the air, two wills and spells collided as the [Sylph Spark] honed in on the magic up there and brought Eldavin’s web of detection and counter-magics into proximity with his opponent.
The [Mages] of Wistram saw Eldavin begin to chant, his hands blurring, the air lighting up around him with magical runes. They gaped as he drew on their mana like batteries, but the war was entirely of his making.
“What’s happening? What’s happening? I must see!”
Valeterisa was shouting like mad. No one replied.
Like a thousand invisible tendrils of kelp in the sky, Eldavin was throwing magical tendrils from his radial point of the [Sylph Spark], questing around, trying to touch the invisible magical web he knew was out there.
“Insolent little [Mage]. Begone, Wistram!”
The voice boomed in his ears. Eldavin saw something pluck at the [Sylph Spark], tearing it apart.
“[Mana Bubble]! I return you once anew, again reborn into a cycle eternal…”
