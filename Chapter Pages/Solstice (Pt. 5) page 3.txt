“Hoi there! A stranger to dine and pass the time away with us? Come in! Come in, on this day!”
One called out, laughing. Another was puking outside, holding a wall for support. Normal pub behavior, in short. They waved at her cheerily—then, like the boy—did double-takes.
“A mortal? It cannot be!”
Jaws dropped. Ryoka waved, smiling.
“Hi. Sorry, I’m just passing through. I’m on my way in, you see—and I was hoping for directions. Is this an inn? Could I come in?”
She saw them glance at each other. Then laugh.
“A mortal comes on the longest day! And she makes it all the way here and asks to enter? Yes! This is an inn. Of sorts. Come in, come in!”
They giggled strangely, drawing Ryoka towards the building. She stopped to admire it. Behind her—the little boy was howling insults.
“Fool! Idiot! Get back here!”
He was standing on his little barricade, waving the stick. The fae chuckled. The sound was like buzzing in her ears. Actually…Ryoka rubbed at her left ear absentmindedly.
“You know yon angry one?”
“The kid? Yeah, he nearly hit me with his stick. You know him?”
“He guards his place, as do we. We do not bother him. ‘Tis a fearsome stick!”
“Yep. Why are you here in this broken city, though? Are you of the Summer Court? Is this where they are? I was told they were in.”
They laughed at this. More came out of the glowing building, and some opened the many glass windows to stare and point at Ryoka. The two fae who’d first spotted her nearly fell on the ground, they were laughing so hard.
“Them? We’re far from as grand as they are! No, we stay here to pass the time. We haven’t the heart to go in. But if you want directions, we’ll show you! Come, come. We’re eating. You may drink and eat with us as a favored guest!”
They were drawing her towards the door. Ryoka smiled giddily. But her ears kept…they were ringing. With the boy’s invocations. And…the buzzing.
The buzzing. That had been in her ears since she’d spotted the inn. Ryoka shook her head as she gazed at the many windows. At the fae.
“Hold on. I’ve already had something to eat and drink. A lot, actually. If you could just show me to where I want to be, that’d be great. Which way’s in?”
“Come into our home and we’ll show you. Come on, just a few more steps.”
The fae encouraged her. Ryoka hesitated. The boy was screaming.
“You stupid brat yourself! You deaf, daft mortal! Don’t you see? See, you idiot! See! By my kin, I command you! Look!”
Ryoka Griffin blinked. Something—the nature of his voice—she wavered. The buzzing was so loud. But beyond it—she heard the boy’s voice. What had he said? Kin? She heard—
A roar. So loud and vast. But she had heard a similar voice before. Ryoka’s head turned. She—
She saw a Dragon. His wings were vast and golden, but covered in the grime of this place. His den, the broken shell of a great structure. Behind her, the wall rose higher than any wall or structure humanity had ever conceived. He roared again.
“Look! Look!”
The young Dragon howled as he breathed golden flame. Ryoka turned and—
