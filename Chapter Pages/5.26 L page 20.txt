“Happy? I don’t know. I think I’m more surprised than anything else. Classes shouldn’t disappear and come back like that. I don’t know why it happened.”
“I don’t know either. But I am glad for you. Truly.”
Pawn fidgeted in his seat. Lyonette looked at him.
“What is it?”
“I was…thinking about yesterday. A lot, actually. I realize now that Miss Krshia may be right. And you too, of course. I may indeed be in love with you.”
“Really?”
“Yes. I realize this may be inconvenient for you. So I will try not to be. In love, that is. I will remove myself and go back to my duties now you are well.”
Pawn awkwardly nodded his head. Lyonette stared at him.
“No.”
“No?”
Why didn’t he get it? Lyonette hesitated, and then reached across the table and grabbed Pawn’s arm.
“Pawn, you don’t give up when you’re in love. Not like that.”
“But it may be inconvenient for you.”
“But I like you, Pawn. As a friend. And if you love me, how could you just give up and not see me?”
The Worker tilted his head.
“Is that not love? Giving up for someone else?”
Lyonette was speechless. She let go of Pawn and sat back. Eventually, she spoke.
“Maybe. But love is more than that. Much more, Pawn.”
“Will you tell me what it is?”
“Love is…coming back every day. To see me. Even if I’m not crying. Even if I have my class back.”
“I see. What else is it?”
“It’s…a lot of things. And I don’t know if I love you! I like you.”
“I see. And I do not know if I love you. The Antinium have never loved, I think. How might we be able to tell the difference between like and love?”
Lyonette stared at Pawn. He looked so matter-of-fact. She laughed, abruptly, and then held out her hand.
“Maybe like this. Take my hand, Pawn.”
“Are we dancing again?”
The Worker took Lyonette’s hand uncertainly. She held it, and then stood up. As Pawn watched she edged around the table to sit by his side. He shifted, looking at her and his hand.
“How strange. What an odd sensation. Is something supposed to happen?”
“Maybe. But holding hands is sort of the point.”
Lyonette gently squeezed Pawn’s hand in hers. His hand was smooth. Foreign. Cool. But there was something familiar about it. She closed her eyes and remembered dancing. And next to her, Pawn shivered.
“When do you let go?”
“When you want to, I suppose. Do you want to?”
“No.”
“Okay then.”
The Human girl looked at Pawn and then looked away. He looked away as well. Both felt awkward. Embarrassed. They sat there like that, looking away. Lyonette felt her cheeks turning red. She couldn’t see Pawn’s face change and was disappointed—until she saw how violently his antennae were twitching. She felt so awkward and yet she didn’t let go of his hand. She didn’t want to.
Pawn stared at Lyonette and looked around. The inn was the same. Lyonette was the same. He was the same. But he couldn’t help but feel different. He looked at their hands, at Lyonette.
“Is love like this all the time, Lyonette?”
“Like what?”
She looked at him, her face flushed. Pawn searched for the words. Then he spoke.
“Something new.”
She paused. And then she smiled.
“Maybe. It might not be love, you know. I’m still not sure myself. But it could be. Would you like to find out?”
Pawn nodded.
“Yes, please.”
They looked at each other and then away. And they didn’t stop holding hands. Lyonette sat in The Wandering Inn. A [Princess] in an inn. And she smiled. The class had nothing to do with her smile. She and Pawn sat there.
Together.
