Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 44
Dodge! The [Knight] went back, weaving, ducking punches. The Bear was slower and he roared. He tried to shoulder-charge and Rabbiteater tumbled. The cheering [Soldiers]’s voices grew a little less loud. Rabbiteater threw a hook—the Bear General went for a trade.

Down again. Zel sipped from a bean soup. Erin was distressed.
“He’s losing! Can you help him?”
“I’m helping enough. Rabbiteater’s finding his pace. I don’t know more than you do. Are you here?”
“Maybe just my Skill. Maybe me? I don’t know! Rabbiteater! Get up! Give him the old one-two!”
“Ignore her.”
Rabbiteater was panting, sitting at the table. His arms hurt. He felt dizzy.
“What am I supposed to do? Do…?”
“Stand up. It’s not over. See? Look at him.”
“Too tired. Is this real?”
Zel Shivertail stood up. He walked over. His claw grasped Rabbiteater’s neck—but gently. He turned the Hobgoblin’s head.
 
—-
 
“Look at him.”
Yerzhen stumbled. Just for a moment. Rabbiteater stood. Panting, he made claws—
 
—-
 
“Not like that.”
“But your claws—”
“He’s not trying to kill you. Have you seen him use a Skill?”
Rabbiteater hesitated. Zel had grabbed his hands.
“If you draw blood, he’ll try to kill you. He’s making this a fistfight. Beat him there.”
“But he’s so tough!”
Zel glanced at Erin, irritated.
“He’s more dangerous still. Listen. Rabbiteater has a chance.”
He looked at the shorter Hobgoblin. Placed a claw on his shoulder and leaned down.
“He’s a [General], but he’s not acting like one. If he were a [General] leading an army he wouldn’t fall no matter how many punches you threw. Not if it mattered. He doesn’t think he’ll lose. He’s overconfident. You can take him. But you’re running out of time. This boon is going to fade.”
“We’re using it up, I guess. Stronger, shorter. And it’s far away.”
The inn was already fading. Zel reached for the bowl of bean porridge and took a bite. Then he put it down.
“Good enough. You’ll only get one shot. If the [Soldiers] see him fall or Yerzhen thinks he’s losing he’ll use a potion and end the fight. Provoke him. Do. Not. Fall.”

The muddy [Knight] charged with a roar that silenced the Humans. The Bear of Ailendamus stared incredulously. Then he bellowed and roared.
Both men drew their heads back at the same time. They met and the head-butt made every watching person wince.
Yerzhen staggered. But the [Knight] dropped as though his strings were cut. Falling—
 
—-
 
“Not yet. Get up. You’re a [Warrior], aren’t you?”
“It’s hard.”
The Drake was holding onto him as Rabbiteater swayed. Refusing to let go. The [General]’s voice was a bellow, like Garen Redfang’s.
“Stand up! Don’t you have something to fight for?”
Talia?

Yerzhen stared as the buckling knees straightened. The [Knight] looked up at him. Yerzhen seized his shoulder.
“Bastard!”
The two heads collided.
 
—-
 
“I was so afraid you were dead. I miss you.”
He lay on her lap.
“Had to go. Everything…”
“Yeah. Why are you sad, Rabbiteater?”
He looked up.
“I don’t know what to do.”
“Isn’t this what you want?”
Erin looked into his eyes. He half-shook his head.
“It’s Human things. Human fights. Is—I am not a [Knight]. See?”
She understood, this Erin. Without him having to explain. Maybe it was part of Erin. Part of him. And part of Zel, listening.
“I get it. You don’t know if it’s okay to…go so far away. But Rabbiteater. I would never make you protect me.”
“But what am I supposed to do?”
Zel snorted. Erin laughed.
“Silly. You’re supposed to do what you think is right. Why do you think they made you a [Champion]? Why do you think I love you? Just tell me this. Do you want to lose?”
