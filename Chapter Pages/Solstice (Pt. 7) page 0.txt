Solstice (Pt. 7)

And she was back. Nama spoke, insistently.
“Remember what you saw. That’s it. Back. Back and back and…there you are.”
Ryoka stood on the ground of the dirt road. Behind her, the forest lay, perfectly tree-like. No vast world-roots, though. Just trees. Sixty feet high, maybe.
The city lay ahead of her, more like a broken, run-down metropolis. Like…a nuclear wasteland’s version of a city. New York with about a week of anarchy.
The mob of fae were running too, like the Summer Guests, just more insectile. They shouted insults in normal language. Ryoka shuddered.
And here was Nama. The woman held Ryoka another second, then let go.
“There. All better? I didn’t think you’d run into them the first instant. Or you’d be so unwise as to not listen to sense.”
Ryoka hung her head. Then threw up. Nama tsked, and backed away. Ryoka, shuddering, looked at her. She wanted to cut off her feet rather than stand on the ground.
“I saw—the forest! The city! Everything is—”
“No it’s not. You just saw that.”
“I know what I saw. It’s all twisted! It’s all—why were you the same?”
“Why would I not be? You may see me as I am. Not as what your mind makes me.”
Nama smacked Ryoka on the head with the spoon. Ryoka clutched at her ringing skull.
Somehow, that made it better. She looked around.
“Then the forest isn’t a grove of flesh and insects and…?”
“Would I live there if it was? You just saw the worst nature of that lot. They’re not the Summer Court. Or the Winter Court. Tsk, tsk. Now you’ve upset them. You won’t get through the city. The forest it must be. And the winter folk have your scent.”
Nama sighed. Ryoka hung her head. But the hostess just adjusted her apron.
“Come now. I’ll take you. It seems I must. Stop crying and follow me. We can stop at my place for another quick rest. You surely need it.”
She took Ryoka’s hand and led her back into the forest. Ryoka kept looking behind her, fearfully.
“But—was that a Dragon? He was a child, with a stick. And then…”
“Of course he is. A brave child. He must have decided to go there rather than fight with the others for space in the forest, though.”
“But he had a stick—”
“I wonder what it was. Don’t you remember? Perception, Ryoka. Perception. What you see is half of reality.”
“And the other half?”
“Actual reality. Now, come along. We had better hope the cold hunters don’t find us. Even I won’t be able to keep you safe.”
Back into the forest. Behind them lay the ruined city. Ryoka looked at Nama.
“What happened? This is the land of the fae, isn’t it?”
“The one with your friend, certainly.”
The woman smiled sadly. Ryoka shuddered.
“But it’s so…what happened here? Why is it so broken? Why is it so empty?”
She had seen so few people here. Nama looked at Ryoka, and the answer came to the Wind Runner unbidden. The empty home of her hostess. The city. The young boy—who was also alone, his lair made among the ruins.
They had died.
The lands of the fae had seen tragedy too. The question was: why? How?
The answers lay before her. The Wind Runner followed Nama into the forest. They picked up the pace.
They had to hurry.
Time was running out.

But an hour had passed since sunset in Riverfarm. The Unseen Empire was dark. The party was ongoing in the village.
Of the special place? Nothing. No one crossed the boundary. Those who had a question for Emperor Laken, or business with any of the nobles, did not seek them out. They were busy. Obviously.
It was as if everyone had forgotten it existed.
A lot of weird things were happening. Not just the gathering of the…guests. Something was up. Worldwide.
