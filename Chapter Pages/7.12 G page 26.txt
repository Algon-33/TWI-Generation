“Hunt for them. Not that hard. Anyways, Wyverns hunt too when fed. And maybe help carry things. Very strong. Also, good defenders…”
Rags gave up.
“Fourteen. Shut up, shut up. If fourteen live. Three look dead.”
“Mm.”
The two rode forwards in silence. After a moment, Rags saw a regular thrush-bird scavenging in the evening light. She stared at it as Thunderfur panted. The bird tensed—so did Redscar.
“No, Thunderfur. Chieftain falls off.”
The Carn Wolf whined as the bird flew off. Rags snorted.
“Couldn’t get bird. Too far.”
“If Thunderfur pounces, could. But only a mouthful. Not worth the effort.”
Redscar informed Rags archly. The Chieftain rolled her eyes. [Beast Tamers] and their animals. Well, Redscar was a [Beast Master] now. Thunderfur had grown another size and he was certainly the alpha wolf—half of the new litters were his.
Soon they’d have little Carn Wolves pooping everywhere and begging for treats. Stupid, intelligent—Rags found herself offering a bit of meat forwards. Redscar fed it to Thunderfur.
“Plan, Chieftain? What next after rebuild?”
“If stupid Wyverns don’t come back? Or giant flesh-abomination? Or the thing with your face?”
“Or Rock Golems?”
Both Goblins sighed. Redscar nodded. Rags shrugged.
“Don’t know. Build fortress better for now. Stronger than Tremborag’s Mountain.”
“Good plan. But what else?”
“…Don’t know. Redscar, did you ever like female Goblins? Ever wonder?”
The Hobgoblin had to think about this. He was a mentor to Rags, in a way, taking up where Pyrite had left off. Well, he always had been, but now that Rags was older, he sometimes had conversations with her, assuaging her curiosity.
“Yes. Tried a few times.”
“And?”
“Eh. Can tell difference. Thunderfur likes females. Not me.”
The [War Leader] patted Thunderfur on the head. Rags nodded. When you knew, you knew, she supposed. Redscar winked at her.
“Chieftain would be first pick if did.”
“Hah. First pick would be Ulvama. With her…and her…”
Rags gestured. Redscar sobered.
“Mm.”
They both fell silent again. After a while, Rags looked at Redscar.
“I wonder if I can tell.”
“What does Chieftain wonder? Likes female or male Hobs? Go try. Many try with Chieftain.”
“No. I wonder…what I’m supposed to do. Everything looks like darkness.”
Redscar paused. He didn’t respond to that. Rags looked ahead, as they finally reached ground level. Leapwolf whistled softly as he waited for them. He pointed ahead.
“Careful. Gargoyles moving nests. Stupid rock-heads.”
The Goblins nodded. They kept an eye out and Redscar and Rags kept their voices even quieter.
“I don’t think Garen ever knew what to do. Always new plan, always…”
Redscar waved his arms in an offhand manner, indicating that Garen, for all his strengths as a warrior, had been a rather lousy Chieftain. Rags nodded.
“Chieftain is smart. If she cannot figure out what to do, no one can.”
“Everyone says that. Maybe everyone just stupid.”
Rags muttered. Redscar smacked her lightly on the shoulder. He pointed ahead as she blushed, embarrassed.
“Moody Chieftain not good for Goblinhome. Going to Eater Goat village. Humans. Chieftain can talk with Humans.”
Rags nodded. She knew that was their destination.
The Eater Goat Village. It had a proper name, but none of the Goblins bothered to remember it. It was the closest village to the High Passes, with naturally high walls—the villagers had built much like Rags had, trusting to geography and construction to keep them safe. The only difference was that theirs was a small village compared to Rags’ Goblinhome project, with less traps.
