Solstice (Pt. 2)

That was all. Ryoka began sobbing. All the tears she’d held back. She was not the only one. Ieka herself wept at parts. And the fae? Their tears fell. They rejoiced in sadness, glory, laughed at the [Innkeeper]’s tricks. Cheered her kindness for the Goblins, the Antinium.
Not everyone smiled. Not everyone agreed. But they listened. Because it was a true story.
Melidore listened too. He only wept once. And that was when the tale came to its end.
The [Innkeeper] lay on the frozen bier, slain by pettiness. The fae wept two shining tears which splashed onto the table and changed the wood forever. He looked at Ryoka and nodded to her as the guests applauded Barelle for nearly five minutes straight.
A standing ovation. Ryoka saw the fae sit back. One moment of laughter. Two tears.
“Enough. That is more than I expected. It was worth coming, this day. For this party, this moment alone, I thank you, Ryoka Griffin.”
He looked at her. The Wind Runner bowed.
“Thank you for coming, Melidore. I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
The fae’s lips quirked. He looked at her and drank again.
“Enjoyed it? You mistake me. My laughter, my tears, this drink—are a small comfort to me. I did not enjoy this day. I have hated every second and fragment of time I stand here. I come here only because I must. But I hate this petty world. I hate what you have forgotten.”
And there it was again. Hate. The fae’s eyes flashed with such intensity that Ryoka and Ieka were left breathless. It was in the other fae. Something unspoken.
“Then why did you come?”
Ryoka asked, when she was able to summon words again. Melidore sighed. And that sigh was melancholy. His eyes met hers. And she felt that gaze of summer again. But tired summer. Weary and worn. The fading season.
“For nothing. To see nothing. That is all.”
A quiet chill ran down Ryoka’s spine. The words meant something. Something—
She looked up. The sun had almost left the sky. The longest day was ending. Suddenly, the food and drink that Ryoka had been partaking of felt heavy in her stomach. She rose.
Her time was nearly up. She had played the guest. And Melidore sat up.
“You may go, Lady Ieka Imarris. Go—and my thanks for this moment. Your guilt shall not touch you unless you continue; that is my favor.”
He nodded to her. The woman went dead white and she stumbled away, practically fleeing. Ryoka did not know what he meant. Nor, in this moment, did she care to know.
She rose. And the fae did too. He drank, carelessly tossing back the wine again as if it were putrid water and he had nothing else to drink. He looked at her.
“Now is the time to ask, friend of Ivolethe. What will you? You have dined and sat with me. You have entertained my kin, and given the Summer Court gifts that amused them. For all that, you are owed the right to ask what you will. So. Now.”
Ryoka’s blood tingled in her veins. She licked her lips.
“Lord Melidore of the Summer Court. I crave a favor. I ask—I ask for—”
She closed her eyes. Lips moving. The fae turned. Ryoka looked into those summer eyes. And she sighed.
“I—I ask for a way to bring back my friend. Erin Solstice, whom you wept for. That is what I wish to ask.”
Cold tears ran down her cheeks. The fae regarded her. He did not ask if this was what she wanted. Ryoka had made up her mind.
Slowly, Melidore turned. And the fae moved out of the crowd. The dancing Summer Court. Strangers from far. Sikeri, Silver Pine. The Satyrs. They all gathered. He stood in the center of them all as Ryoka looked at the statue of Ivolethe. And the first of the guests?
He looked at Ryoka and smiled.
 
“No.”
