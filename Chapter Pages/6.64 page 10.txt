Erin was surprised to see Palt, but only a bit. He’d been here every day, trying to ingratiate himself into the inn. The Centaur winced when he heard about the butt-slap incident. He wondered if the adventurer who’d made the unfortunate life decision had lost any teeth.
“It’s a compliment, they say. Like touching your tail. Eugh! Old Drakes doing that are the worst.”
Drassi was complaining. Erin folded her arms.
“Anyone does it in my inn, they get kicked out! And hit with hammers! Got it?”
She glared around. Lyonette just sighed. The [Innkeeper] was on the warpath.
“Erin, did you find the Horns? I thought you were going to check on them.”
Erin hesitated.
“Oh. No, they were on patrol. But then that jerk Walt and his team—”
“Was it their fault? I mean, I wasn’t there, but maybe they got the wrong impression?”
That came from the side. Erin looked askance as she stared at a Drake.
“What?”
He looked uncomfortable at the stares, but he went on, determined to make his point.
“If they thought you were flirting—”
“I wasn’t!”
“Did you smile?”
“Of course I—smiling is not flirting! I can smile at you without wanting to flirt! And butt-slaps aren’t part of that! Hey! Who thinks a smile means I’m automatically interested in you? Huh?”
No one was willing to look at Erin. The lunch crowd—one half of it—coughed and went to their drinks. Relc, sitting at his table, nudged Klbkch.
“Idiots. You know they’re into you if their tail touches yours. Right, my guy? Right, Klb?”
“Stop elbowing me. I am not your ‘guy’ either.”
Erin was still fuming as she sat down. Mrsha hopped into her lap and gave her a hug. She smiled, but then she scowled at the door. Palt approached with the steaming plate and a few Gnolls looked up.
“Why don’t we all calm down? Miss Erin, I’m sure the adventurer has learned his ways if I know you. Rather than dwell, try this!”
“Ooh! What’s this? Rice? And it’s yellow! Like uh—stir fry!”
Palt’s face fell only a tiny bit. But then he brightened.
“You’re familiar with it?”
“Of course! Yeah! It’s like uh, Chin—”
Erin paused and bit her tongue on what she’d been about to say.
“—rice! Did you make it, Palt?”
“I showed Miss Lyonette a bit of how to use the saffron. Would you like a taste?”
Modestly, the Centaur offered Erin the plate. She took the spoon and gingerly tasted it.
“Whoa.”
“Is it good?”
“Whoa. It’s good!”
Her comments and the word saffron made more guests look up. One of them coughed.
“Is there more?”
“Saffron rice with vegetables! Any takers? It’ll be—two silver a plate?”
“That’s a lot! Your prices are sky-high!”
One of the regulars complained. Lyonette scowled.
“It’s new! I’ll drop the price later! But this is made with saffron. You know, the stuff that comes from Chandrar and is worth gold for just a tiny bit?”
More interest. Palt watched as Lyonette hurried into the kitchen. Erin was still exclaiming over the food as Mrsha tried to sneak bites off her spoon.
“It’s so—flavorful! Hey, I wonder if Lasica knows how to make this? You told me you cooked, but not like this, Palt!”
The Centaur sat at the table, moving a chair out of the way. He was pleased by her reaction.
“I do dabble. I’m fond of using spices and no one else in my team can cook. Well, Isceil prefers to roast meat and Beza can make…Minotaur cuisine. But I do most of the work.”
The [Innkeeper] eyed Palt.
“Oh yeah? You know spices well? Because you’re a stoner?”
The Centaur sighed.
