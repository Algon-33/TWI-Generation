A [Soldier] fought to swing up his shield as Talia rode down on him. Another [Pikewoman] stared at the shaft of her weapon. The treated ash was beginning to smoke. Then—it burst into flame as the [Summer Knight] approached.
Aura. A thousand [Knights] were bringing the heat of the summer into this confined pass. Rabbiteater’s eyes widened.

General Vexil felt the wave of heat dry the damp from his clothing. He croaked.
“Sound the retreat. Dismantle the Greatbows. Hold them off—form a line here and—retreat!”
He hadn’t expected this. The palace? The palace was going to have his head. He had to pull the [Soldiers] back. He could do that, at least. Save the Greatbows!
His [Strategists] looked at him, but then they sprang into action. Vexil scrambled for his mount, which was trying to run out of this—this oven! Damn those [Knights]! Burning to death was not honor!
The [General] was trying to undo the unwisely sturdy knot he’d tied with the reins. He gave up and slashed them free. He was in the saddle when the steam cloud parted. One of his [Strategists] ran back towards him.
“General, they’ve reached the command—”
Vexil saw a lance run the man through the back. The [General] looked up. In the chaos, the [Summer Knights] were routing the fleeing army of Ailendamus, who were running out of the heat wave. Even they had no idea where the enemy really was with the steam blocking everything.
A [Knight], breathing slightly hard, stopped when he spotted Vexil. The [General] had drawn his sword.
“You damned cowards. Which Season are you? Winter?”
He stared at the grey armor—not like Summer or Autumn. Spring? A new [Knight]? No—Vexil saw the [Knight] raise his sword and shield at once, on-guard.
“Hm. Not any season. Just me.”
The [Knight] grunted in reply. Vexil hesitated. A foreign [Knight]? He pressed his knees into his stallion’s side, bracing.
“Then—die!”
He lunged forwards, riding in hard. His sword extended. The [Champion] saw the blow coming and threw himself out of the saddle.
[Greater Speed].
Rabbiteater hit the ground, rolled. The enemy [Soldier] thundered past him, cursing. Turning. He was too canny to let Rabbiteater take him from behind.
“Face me, [Knight]! I am Vexil of Ailendamus!”
It seemed like he’d run into an officer of some kind. Rabbiteater’s [Dangersense] was tingling. Of all the times to lose Talia and Voost! He hid himself in the steam, grateful his armor gave him more cover. He heard the horse’s hooves even amid the fighting around him.
Well, this was more of a Redfang’s fight anyways. Rabbiteater grinned. He moved sideways, as Vexil’s head turned. However, the man couldn’t hear him.
[Muffled Armor]. A low-level [Knight-Errant]’s Skill. Rabbiteater eyed the horse he could barely see.
“Sorry, horse.”
“There you a—dead gods!”
That was because Rabbiteater had thrown his sword. He’d angled it right, so the hilt smacked the horse on the neck. Hard. The animal reared. Vexil might have maintained control—but then Rabbiteater threw his shield.
The stallion had had enough. It bucked the [General], and he lost his grip on the severed reins, forgetting they were cut. He hit the ground, but rolled onto his feet.
“You—cowardly—”
The [General] spat mud out of his mouth. He whirled, trying to guard himself on all sides. Why had that [Knight] thrown his sword? He turned, sensed the air ripple—
“[Perfect Parry]!”
[Grand Slash]. The two Skills collided and Rabbiteater heard a cry. He frowned through the steam. It sounded like the Human had managed to block part of it. But he’d still hit armor.
