The [Eternal Beauty] was looking down at Klbkch and Xrn. Magnolia strode down the steps. The air was humming between Pryde and Xrn. The [Lady] looked away as Ressa and Reynold backed up.
“Nalthaliarstrelous?”
The [Druid] was panting. He nodded to her.
“I have it. Not all that lies beneath. That dungeon—it’s vast. But I have it. Tunnels. You’re right. There’s a damn one going south. Big. And all the numbers.”
The…Klbkch’s mouth opened. He looked at Xrn. And the Small Queen’s anxiety made sense. The [Druid] looked at the Antinium.
“Counted all of them too. Some are higher level. Most’re the same. Here’s the numbers. I’ll do the map later.”
He scribbled down on a piece of paper Ressa produced, with a quill. Magnolia studied the first one.
“How. Interesting. Nalthaliarstrelous, you are a treasure. And with that, our work is done. Watch Captain, Council. Miss Xrn.”
“You have made an error.”
The Small Queen stared at Magnolia. Her staff was glowing. But Wuvren took Pryde’s place. The [Lady of Pryde] looked at Wuvren.
“No.”
“I’ll go last. Pryde, don’t be stubborn.”
Pryde retreated. Wuvren blew a kiss. It went through Klbkch and nothing happened. Her face fell slightly.
“Not even a bit?”
Magnolia was walking back towards the door as Reynold helped Nalthaliarstrelous. He looked tired, from the life-sensing spell. Because that was what a [Druid] did. And of course, they could sense things like nature. Like…tunnels in the earth.
Klbkch ignored Wuvren. He put one hand on his sword and looked at Xrn.
“Do we stop them?”
“You may try. But that would be war. And you’re surrounded.”
Magnolia called out cheerfully. The Antinium looked around. At the crowds. At Watch Captain Zevara, who had suddenly put herself in their way. The Watch Captain looked at Magnolia.
“That number—”
“I plan on sharing it. And I will of course have Nalthaliarstrelous copy the map.”
“I hate maps.”
The [Druid] growled. They walked through the door. And the Antinium just watched.
Erin Solstice saw Magnolia Reinhart enter the inn, then Ressa and Reynold and Nalthaliarstrelous.
Then Pryde. Wuvren was last. Warily backing up. And Erin just looked at Magnolia. Just—looked.
“What have you done?”
“What matters, Miss Solstice. I hope you’ll forgive me. But even if not—Ressa? Our next destination.”
Magnolia turned. And Ressa was adjusting the door. Erin saw a glowing yellow stone.
Pallass. And it all came together. Erin reached out and Pryde and Wuvren blocked her.
“Stop. Please. They’re not—”
Grimalkin caught Erin’s arm. Gently. And Magnolia Reinhart walked through the doorway.
In Pallass, the Drakes and Gnolls on duty stared at her. And Lady Magnolia spoke.
“I am Lady Magnolia Reinhart. I would like to speak to Grand Strategist Chaldion, please.”
They hesitated. The other [Ladies] and servants walked through. Nalthaliarstrelous walked back towards Erin’s garden. [Sergeant] Kel looked at Magnolia.
And whatever he thought about Erin, Lady Chaos, whatever you wanted to call her—
Here was an actual [Lady]. And a City Runner stormed into the checkpoint.
“Sergeant Kel! Immediate orders!”
The [Sergeant] read. The gate rose instantly. And Magnolia Reinhart walked forwards.
“We have orders to escort you to Grand Strategist Chaldion at once.”
The Watch informed the [Lady]. She nodded.
“Of course.”
And she entered Pallass. Magnolia Reinhart stepped along the street. Drakes and Gnolls looked up as she walked. Pryde and Wuvren fell in behind her.
“The last time a Reinhart walked on Pallass’ walls was nearly six hundred years ago. And that was to be executed after capture in battle.”
