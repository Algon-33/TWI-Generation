One left. One remained. The [Lady] of House El made her last stand amid glorious flame. Ryoka Griffin was crying.
Four Faces left. Three had rushed into the flames, unable to stop themselves. The Ranks perished, fighting beings made of fire.
Elementals.
The last four had struggled with all their will not to rush after Maviola El. At last, though, they’d caught up.
Ryoka Griffin had stopped. Her feet were a ragged mess. And Ferin realized—
She was out of healing potions. She was panting. Had she given up?
No. The [Trapmaster] knew it. But why had she slowed? He looked at his companions.
Four of them. Ferin, the [Mage], the [Blademaster], and one last one. Mire and the others had stayed behind to fight the [Knights]. Others had died.
The Guild…would not recover from this. They would have to be remade, if they lived at all. Perhaps another Guild. Another continent.
Roshal—Ferin shook his head and looked up. Never there. He would rather…
“Stop, Ryoka Griffin. You can still stop.”
She flinched. The [Assassins] were spreading out. The [Blademaster] moved forwards—hesitated.
His nerves had been broken by watching so many of his companions die. The invincible Guild’s mythos—gone. Ferin motioned him forwards, but the [Mage] and fourth were circling. Ensnaring Ryoka before the end from all sides if she tried to make a break for it.
“…Is that you, [Trapmaster]?”
Ryoka looked up. She was preoccupied with something in her bag of holding. The air was still. Ferin nodded.
“It will not end with your death, Miss Griffin. Everyone you love will die. That is the Guild’s promise to you. Unless you stop.”
He looked at the [Blademaster] again. The idiot was afraid. Afraid of a death like Saliss of Lights or Maviola El’s burning fury. He would never be an [Assassin] again.
“You can’t escape us, Ryoka. You’re not that quick.”
It was true. Ryoka exhaled. It had always been true.
If she were a Courier like Mihaela. If she had levels. If she had been smarter. If Xif hadn’t had such a big fucking mouth.
If, if, if. But this was where she was. She had made so many decisions to get here. Some good, some bad.
…Yet that was the beauty of this world. Of any world. Ryoka looked up. She had not come here unchanged.
“I have one last thing.”
“The wind? It’s not yours alone, Runner.”
The [Mage]-[Assassin] sneered. Ryoka nodded. She could feel magic keeping the wind still. But—it was just a spell. The wind was surely more powerful than one [Mage]. She just had to ask it.
The Wind Runner looked back at Ferin. The old [Assassin] she had met just once on a ride to another delivery that might have been her death. There was something of her in him. But they were—different. She shook her head. He drew the loop of wire. Ryoka sighed.
“Tell me, stranger. Do you know how to fly?”
The [Assassins] looked at each other. One lifted his wand. And the [Blademaster] hesitated again. Too late. Ferin threw as Ryoka’s words reached him.
“It’s easy. I’ve been so afraid to try. But all you have to do is step into—”
Something unfolded. His wire struck it, bounced off instead of looping around her. Ferin cursed. He saw wings unfolding. Then the wind howled. The [Mage] cried out. Ferin lunged forwards with the others. And saw Ryoka lift upwards Into—
The sky.
“H-how?”
The other [Assassins]—even the fourth—stared in dumbfounded shock for a second. A Scroll of Flying? But those were wings.
Yet not Ryoka’s. It was…a contraption like the bicycle. Something she had asked to be made in Reizmelt before meeting the Archmage of Izril, even.
