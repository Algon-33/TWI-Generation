It was just a flash of light. A black bolt of energy that went through her chest. Thrissiam screamed. The Goblin Lord turned his hand. Pointed.
“Despair.”
A black scythe shot out, cutting through the ranks of soldiers that had followed Garusa. Not just through them, through Goblins as well. Bodies crumpled to the floor, dead. Lifeless. Everybody in two hundred meters in the direction the Goblin Lord had pointed fell. And then—
“Rise.”
They rose. Unsteadily, getting to their feet. Garusa stood up, and for a second, Thrissiam dared to hope—then her head turned and he saw the hole in her chest. And the light in her eyes.
The undead, half of his army and the Goblin Lord’s—stared towards the remaining soldiers. Their eyes shone, and they began to walk, and then to run. They charged back towards their former comrades.
“Now finish this.”
The voice spoke once more, and then the Goblin Lord was stumbling as other Goblins rushed to his side. Thrissiam stared at him, and then at the undead.
Thousands of them, ten thousand—twenty—each and every corpse on the battlefield had risen all at once. And now they came for his army. The Drakes and Gnolls, steadfast warriors, cried out and broke ranks, retreating.
“No.”
“Uncle! Uncle!”
Someone was screaming his name. Above. Thrissiam looked up. Osthia flew down towards him, wounded, bleeding. Her face was pale, her eyes filled with tears.
“He—it—”
He’d sent all of the Oldblood soldiers with her. Six had gone, none had returned. There was an arrow in one of Osthia’s wings. Now more showered down around Thrissiam as the Goblin army redoubled its attack.
He stared at her blankly. Then at the undead. They were coming. So many. Enough to bury what remained of his army. And Garusa—she was out there too.
“We’ve lost.”
There was nothing hard in saying it. Osthia’s eyes widened. Thrissiam went on.
“We lost the moment we failed to understand. It wasn’t him. We shouldn’t have just feared him. It was who was controlling him. Do you understand?”
He looked at Osthia.
“The Necromancer.”
She paled.
“But he’s dead.”
“Not anymore.”
Thrissiam turned. His officers were staring in shock, paralyzed by what had happened.
“Scouts! Runners!”
Thrissiam bellowed. He could still do that. His voice snapped some out of their fog. They looked towards him. Thrissiam saw some turning, coming towards him. No time.
“Run!”
They stared at him. Thrissiam pointed, south, the way they had come.
“Run! Go to the cities! Warn them! Go! Now!”
No time to tell them. If they were smart, the others would figure it out. Thrissiam pointed and shouted. He saw Drakes and Gnolls dashing for the trees, running past Goblins, trying to escape as the Goblin Lord’s army came from every side.
“Uncle—are you—”
Thrissiam turned to Osthia. Her eyes were wide. She probably didn’t realize she was calling him Uncle. He nearly laughed. He wasn’t old enough to be her uncle.
What a silly thing to think of. Thrissiam smiled at Osthia as he gave her his last order.
“You too, Osthia. Go. Fly away. Tell them who the real enemy is.”
“I can’t! I can’t abandon—”
“Go. There’s no point in dying here. You are the pride of Drakes. My family. You have to tell them.”
She refused, shaking. The undead were coming. Thrissiam’s eyes were on them. On the Goblin Lord. He was falling back, carried by his soldiers. Osthia was trying to stay.
“Go.”
“Drakes do not run!”
He turned to her.
“I know. Hurry up and come back soon.”
