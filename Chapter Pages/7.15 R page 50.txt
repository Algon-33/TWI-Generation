Six fireballs flew at Belavierr. The [Witch] turned. She walked through the waves of spells and arrows. And a needle appeared in her hands.
The arrows turned in the air. The fletching screamed and the arrows flickered back to their owners. Screams. Jewel stared. The Stitch-Witch was gone. She had walked in a single step—
There. To the side. Jewel tried to move. And then she realized she couldn’t. She struggled. Little threads were binding her. Her arms slowly moved, back, back.
Snap. Belavierr listened to the scream. She turned. And the [Fireballs] hovered in midair. Todi’s Elites stared as their magic halted. The Stitch Witch tilted her head right and left. And then—Revi saw her reach out and pluck a strand of fire from the first glowing spell.
The fireballs, swirling masses of fire, moved. They became strands of fire. Weaving together, becoming a tangled orb of fire. Belavierr looked at it. And then she pointed.
“Teleport!”
Todi’s team vanished. The fireball detonated. And the fire—
The flash and heat kicked Revi, even a hundred feet distant. She landed on her back as her horse reared, throwing her. She heard screams. Halrac’s voice.
“Retreat! Fall back!”
Adventurers were screaming. In a second, dozens had been downed. The arrows, the string webs around Belavierr that snapped limbs like twigs—
And the needles. They flashed through the air.
“Behind me! [Shield Wall]!”
Briganda threw up her buckler. Revi saw her shield glow—a hail of needles snapped as they hit the barrier. Briganda grunted.
“Halrac—”
“Cover me, Typhenous.”
“I’ll try.”
The [Mage] raised his staff as Halrac drew an arrow. Belavierr turned her head as the [Mage] threw an orb at her, a glowing violet ball of energy. She lifted the needle in her hand.
Revi saw the magical ball of power vanish. Typhenous turned pale.
“How…?”
“[Mages] weave magic carelessly. Look. I see a cloth-child.”
Belavierr’s voice was deep. Quiet. Absent. But then she refocused. And she was looking at Revi.
“[Piercing Shot]. [Double Shot].”
Halrac loosed. Two arrows flew. Belavierr lifted her hand. They snapped in midair, as the fletching moved.
“How did she—”
“String. Stitches.”
Briganda breathed. Revi lifted her wand, reaching for a summoning stone. Her wand pointed at Belavierr’s chest. And then moved down. Revi stared at her arm. Belavierr looked at her.
“Do you know me, child?”
“Revi, get back!”
Halrac was doing something. He raised another arrow to his string. Typhenous was trying to conjure another spell. But something was wrong.
“I can’t use magic. She’s—unweaving my spells.”
“Revi—”
“I can’t move.”
The [Summoner] tried. But her strings, her cloth was—vibrating. Belavierr turned her head left and right.
“Even the String People forget me. Perhaps I have been gone too long. My daughter was right. I forget. So these are adventurers?”
She turned her head. Jewel was lying on the ground. Her arms were broken. Todi aimed a wand at her. This time a bolt of lightning shot at her, fast as thought. It curved up and gently formed a loop. It hit the man on the chest and he went flying. Alive? His amulets—
“Todi!”
“Spells don’t work. Nothing with cloth. We have to fight her—”
Typhenous drew his dagger. Belavierr looked at him as he lunged. He was fast—
His robes threw him into the air. Briganda swore. She dove, catching the old [Mage]. She whirled, hatchet raised—
Belavierr reached down and grabbed the [Shield Maiden]’s foot. She stood up. And threw Briganda at a wall.
The Gold-rank adventurer went through the brickwork wall. Revi stared. So did Belavierr.
“So this is Gold-rank now. Intriguing.”
