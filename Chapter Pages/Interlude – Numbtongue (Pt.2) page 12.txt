Interlude – Numbtongue (Pt.2)

Yellow Splatters nodded.
“Yes. That is it exactly. I have more to protect. My…people need me to be strong. So I must be strong.”
The Goblin [Bard] smiled for a second. A trace of bitterness flickered in his eyes.
“Good plan. Doesn’t work for me. Mine are dead. Or gone.”
“Then why do you stay? What keeps you moving? What reason do you have to be alive?”
The question had no rancor; it was just a question from one warrior to another. Numbtongue smiled. He pointed at the door.
“Someone has to stay. To protect…”
“Ah.”
And that was the beauty. He didn’t have to explain why Erin had to live. Why her life could justify the countless dead. Yellow Splatters understood. He reached out and made a fist. Numbtongue stared at it, gently perplexed. The Soldier spoke calmly.
“It is good you remain here. You are strong. I have a strong body, gifted to me by the Free Queen. Thus, I am stronger than when I died. But I must level. That is what I intend to do. I lost all but six levels when I died. I have regained five already; I intend to reach Level 20 within the month.”
“To be strong. To be the strongest.”
Another nod. The Soldier kept his fist extended, towards Numbtongue’s chest.
“I must be the strongest of them all. And make them stronger. But do it with…kindness. I failed once before. It will not happen again.”
“Good. Be strong.”
Numbtongue reached out. His own fist extended and Yellow Splatters nodded. They bumped fists gently. Yellow Splatters regarded Numbtongue, his head tilting slightly back and forth.
“I understand now, why you are here. But what will you do? Train? Level? If you wish it, it would be possible for you to fight against local threats and patrol with the Painted Antinium. Your company would be enjoyable.”
Numbtongue wavered. He was pleased at the offer, but he shook his head in the end.
“No good.”
“Why?”
Yellow Splatters was honestly confused. Numbtongue struggled to explain. The best he could was by talking about the images in his head. The inferiority he felt when he picked up a sword.
“I know a strong Goblin. The strongest. He fought the…Human. Lord Tyrion. He stopped him. He was stronger than me. And he died. How can I be that strong? I am a [Bard].”
Pyrite. Shorthilt. Headscratcher. Each had been stronger than Numbtongue. And each was dead. He wasn’t as gifted as they had been in combat. And his class…Numbtongue closed his eyes and shook his head. Yellow Splatters regarded him.
“But they are dead. You could surpass their levels in time. Does a [Bard] not become strong?”
“Not like a [Sergeant]. Or…[Warrior].”
“Really. What does your class do?”
The Hobgoblin shrugged.
“Lightning from the skies. But mostly—makes music. It helps a bit. Makes animals not bite. But it isn’t like…[Warmaster]. [Chieftain]. Or even [Savage Warrior]. Those are strong classes.”
“Really. They are not ones I am familiar with. But I do not know many classes.”
That surprised Numbtongue. He shook his head.
“I know lots. What do you have? [Sergeant]? Not a Goblin class. But could have…[Spear Soldier]. [First Sergeant]. [Captain]. At…Level 20? If you can upgrade. But [Warrior] classes are good. Sometimes better. [Sergeant] is officer. Good for leading, but sometimes weaker. Sometimes strong.”
“You know a lot about classes.”
“We had many. I was just a [Warrior]. But Garen knew many classes and there were many in my tribe. The Redfangs wer—are strong.”
“Stronger than the Antinium. At least, individually.”
Another nod. It came from both sides. Yellow Splatters was under no illusions. He sat on Numbtongue’s chair while the Hobgoblin sat on the bed, cross-legged.
