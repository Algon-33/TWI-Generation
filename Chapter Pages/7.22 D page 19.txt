Geneva backed up. The sign on Paige’s door read, ‘DO NOT ENTER’. The [Doctor] hesitated.
“I was concerned—”
“Parasites? We had the jars frozen once they arrived. And Daly and the others kept them securely contained in bags of holding. Nothing was opened; they still want to be tested. And I’m investigating. See?”
She held up a magnifying glass. More crude glass, like the mask she wore. Paige glanced at Geneva.
“Good to see you. Hi, Okasha.”
“Hi, Paige.”
Geneva waved at Paige. Then she slapped her other hand down. She backed up.
“I’m…getting to work. Sorry about…”
“Shut the door, please. Thanks.”
The [Doctor] closed the door silently. She turned to Kirana and Luan. They were eying her.
“I’ll check Paige later. Something could still be living in the room. We’ll still sterilize—”
“I put down poison and the room was secured until you opened it.”
Paige shouted from inside the room. Geneva’s mouth closed. She turned.
“I’m getting to work. I need to be at the clinic tonight. I’ll talk to you later, Luan, Kirana.”
“Sure.”
The two chorused. Geneva hesitated. She disappeared into her secure laboratory, next to Paige’s. Luan studied it.
“In retrospect, it was a mistake to put their rooms together, yeah?”
“But if something gets loose, we can explode Paige’s workshop. Or if it explodes, it kills the germs.”
The [House Keeper] countered. Luan smiled crookedly. He glanced up at Geneva, and then turned to Kirana. The young Indian woman was leafing through the journal.
“Is there anything Geneva can use? She’s stressing about the Yellow Rivers plague. It’s getting bad. We could use a win, Kirana.”
“I don’t know. I don’t think so. He used this…paste for his cuts. In one of the jars. I will tell Paige. But it stopped bleeding. Not cured sickness. He was sick here. See?”
She showed Luan a dated entry. He nodded, although he couldn’t read.
“Anything interesting?”
“Venoms from a…purple place. Daly will want them.”
“Tell Geneva.”
“She won’t like it.”
“No, tell her because the venoms might be a cure. Or useful in her research. I think that’s how it works.”
Luan shrugged helplessly. Kirana nodded. She read a few more bookmarked spots.
“There is…one more interesting thing. Monsters aside. But I have to ask Daly. This Dev. He was alone, right?”
“Yup. He never made it out.”
The [Rower] leaned on the balcony, suddenly tired. He looked at Kirana. She was younger than him by…seven years. But she felt older. They were all growing up. Still, he and Geneva were the oldest. Adults. But for all Luan admired Geneva—she could be less mature than the nineteen year-old young woman from India.
Kirana nodded. Her eyes flicked across the page. Then she showed him something else.
“Here. Something strange. Right on this day. He met someone in The Dyed Lands. Someone—scary.”
“Scary?”
Luan frowned. There was a picture. A woman, standing in the doorway. All shadow, but Dev had captured some features. Not enough. Just enough to make Luan…uneasy. The [Explorer] had captured his mood.
“Another [Explorer]?”
Kirana read on.
“No. She got past all of the—traps. And she left no footprints. Dev was afraid. It says the woman offered him something. Wanted Dev to take her hand. He thought—”
She hesitated. And then closed the book abruptly. She blinked a few times. Luan looked at her. Kirana had suddenly gone pale.
“What?”
“Nothing. He just wrote that he thought it was a bhoot. Or—something worse.”
“A—bhoot?”
She looked at him.
“A…ghost. Or a—”
She searched for a while. Then she put the journal away and didn’t open it any longer.
“A devil.”
