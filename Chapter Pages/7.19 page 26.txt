It was always the one you weren’t prepared for. They were turning a corner and walking down a tunnel that had been cleared; the two traps were clearly marked. That was when Nailren held up a paw.
“Oh no.”
He whispered. The other Silver-rank adventurers froze. They stared ahead. Earlia, grabbing at her warhammer, saw nothing at first. Until—she saw the little head peeking around the corner.
A Goblin’s head. It was staring, wide-eyed—far away. Unblinking. Earlia felt her mouth dry up at once.
If you didn’t know, you’d think it was just a Goblin. Until you realized the head was unnaturally placed. Low to the ground, peeking out, shaking a bit.
The Goblin’s eyes never blinked. Because the head was dead. It was on a stick. And what was holding it was—
“Oh no. No, no. Not now. Dead gods.”
One of the Gnolls in Kelia’s Pride began to moan. Nailren aimed his bow.
“Facestealer.”
The adventurers whispered. A name that had circulated through their ranks. And Earlia felt something walking on her grave.
A guardian of this dungeon. It had only ever appeared twice. Both times—the team had been found headless. Once, a Silver-rank team. The second, a Gold-rank duo.
“No, no, no, no—”
“Quiet! Spread out! Retreat along the corridor we just came down! Send an emergency [Message] spell at once! To all Gold-rank teams!”
Nailren ordered. Both Silver-rank teams ran back down the corridor. Nailren loosed an arrow and then turned and ran.
The corridor they’d come down was long, and wide. A perfect place not to be trapped in. The teams spread out as far as they could.
“It paralyzes everything in range. That’s what the notes say. We just have to buy time. Help is on the way.”
Earlia gritted her teeth. Her team looked at her. No one believed her.
“Eyes forwards and back! Loose an arrow—slow it down!”
Nailren was shouting, ignoring the rule for silence. Other monsters might be a blessing at a time like this. The other adventurers peered around.
“I see it! I see it!”
Earlia whirled as someone shouted. She saw a head disappear around a corner as a Gnoll [Archer] loosed.
Then—two heads popped back. One was a Raskghar’s face. The other—Earlia recoiled.
Human. The face stared at her.
“Is that—Tessa?”
Shrapnel whispered. The other adventurers stared at the Gold-rank adventurer’s face. Someone began to moan.
“Fea! Shut up!”
Earlia ordered her friend, but Fea’s fear was contagious. The heads bobbed. Then a third face joined it. The Goblin’s.
They wiggled, moving up and down. And then—something leaned around the corner.
Facestealer had no face himself. No head or neck. The huge, lumpen figure had two indentations in its chest. Nothing above it. It held the heads on crude sticks as it peeked at them.
“Tribes save us.”
Nailren whispered. He aimed his bow, loosed an arrow. Facestealer disappeared before the arrow could strike it.
“It’s fast.”
“Don’t retreat! Spread out. Buy time. Send another [Message]!”
Was anyone coming? Had they—left them for dead? Earlia’s hands shook as she lifted her warhammer. She remembered the ring and fumbled for it. Maybe it would help? Better to be cursed than die.
“It’s coming.”
The heads were wobbling as they appeared around the corner. Moving faster and faster. Jiggling obscenely. Earlia could sense Facestealer building momentum. Faster and faster they moved. Then they vanished.
“I don’t want…”
Earlia found the ring in her cold fingers. She stared ahead as a shape blurred around the corner. It was too fast. Too big—

The woman opened her eyes. She was lying on the ground. She didn’t understand at first. But then she realized.
