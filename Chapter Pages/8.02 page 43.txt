“To toughen up young Gnolls. We don’t beat cubs. But we do kick out the stupid of our young warriors when they’re nearly of age. Every Gnoll thinks he or she’s the toughest [Warrior] in the world. So. We make them fight a cow when they’re sixteen.”
The two young Gnolls looked at him.
“You mean…a Razorhorn Bull or something like that, Honored Berrigral?”
He looked puzzled.
“No. I mean a cow. An angry one.”
“So just a bull.”
“Mm. They don’t have to be male. We don’t give them any weapons. They get to fight with their paws versus a cow. All those spitfire Gnolls think they’re so strong until a cow sits on their legs. They usually don’t die, though. That’s what those Gnolls need. Traditionalists. Always arrogant.”
“Isn’t Wild Wastes a traditional tribe?”
Berr gave Dekava a blank look.
“I suppose it is. But we don’t care. Good fight, younglings! Call me if you have another. Especially if you get Iraz. I want to see if he’s any tougher.”
He wandered off. Tkrn stared after him. Truly, the Meeting of Tribes brought all kinds of Gnolls.
Krshia smacked him. Then she pinched his ear.
“And what were you doing?”
“Aunt! I was just trying to help—my ear!”
Tkrn whined. Krshia was in the middle of tongue-lashing him when someone came over.
“Excuse me. Please do not be too angry at…Tkrn? He helped me. I would have been hurt otherwise.”
Tkrn and Krshia turned. Inkar had come over with the Longstalkers to apologize and thank him. Chieftain Eska nodded, a touch warily, at Akrisa. Krshia let go of Tkrn. She smiled, ruefully.
“At least he did some good this time. You are…Inkarr?”
“Inkar of the Longstalkers. Yes.”
“Inkarr the Traveller. And she is Honored Inkarr. I think of her as a granddaughter!”
Deskie put in fondly. Krshia blinked, but she smiled.
“Honored Inkarr. I am Honored Krshia. And this is my nephew who causes much trouble, Tkrn!”
He hung his head. But Inkar nodded at him.
“Thank you, Tkrn.”
“It was nothing. I’m uh—a [Guard]. I just acted on instinct, Miss Inkar.”
She blinked.
“Say that again.”
“I acted on instinct?”
“No, my name.”
“Inkar?”
The young woman was delighted. She clapped her hands.
“I knew someone could say it!”
Tkrn realized he hadn’t put the rolling r’s on the end of her name that every other Gnoll did. A city accent—Inkar was laughing.
“Oh good, she’s safe. And is this Silverfang? I was going to play baseball.”
A commotion. From the side came Lehra Ruinstrider, as some of her tribe kept the crowd back. Tkrn and the others stared. Half the Gnolls bowed—but she grinned.
“Hello. Is it Tkrn and Inkar? I’m Lehra.”
She casually stuck out a paw. Inkar hesitated, then she took it, and Tkrn did likewise. He blinked at her.
“You’re the Stargnoll. The youngest Named Adventurer in…”
“Don’t call me that. Just Lehra is fine. And you’re from Liscor, right? The city with…popcorn. I’ve been dying to try it, but not even Oteslia had any!”
“Popcorn?”
“And cake. I heard you have special, tall cakes. And ice cream and…”
The Gnoll looked longingly at her team. Half of them rolled their eyes—and when a Gazer did it, that was something.
This was the moment. Merish was shaking his head, a bit embarrassed. But he too was looking at the Human. Tkrn was speaking.
“Thank you for helping. I just—we have Humans in my city. So when I thought someone was trying to get rid of one because she was Human—”
“I like Humans. My entire team is like me!”
Lehra grinned. Merish looked at Viri, who was hopping forwards, excited to meet a Named Adventurer. And that was the attitude. He himself remembered a glorious company. It had been so short…
