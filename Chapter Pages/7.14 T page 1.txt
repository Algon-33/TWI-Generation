“Oh, no. I’m quite real. You—made me. But I’ve always been here. You just haven’t been listening. And I have needed to wake up.”
And then—there she was. Standing in front of him. Well, not standing. In that void, without up or down—she was just there. Amid oblivion.
A female skeleton, wearing ragged clothes. Wearing a mask, a glint of purple light sometimes visible from behind the slits. She had a female form, and her garments disguised her true nature.
She wore a sword. And she even stood differently than he had in life. A [Sword Dancer]. The female skeleton waved at Toren.
“Yoohoo. Are you listening, Toren?”
Her voice appeared in his head. And it was—different. Distinct from any voice that was…Toren’s. Female. Unique.
Her.
“It’s me. Female Toren. Or is it Torena? You never really gave me a name.”
The female skeleton took her mask off for a second and grinned. A skeleton’s eternal smile. She was like him, and not. Toren—the helpless captive could only listen. What was happening?
This was too…real. Even for a memory, or a delusion. And yet—it was not reality. Torena went on.
“Torena? I don’t like the name. My name should be different. More…separate. N…Nek..Nekhti. Close enough.”
She scratched her head. And she put the mask back on and grinned at him.
“Surprised I have a voice? That I was real? Of course I was. You’re a skeleton, Toren. You don’t have fake voices in your head. That’s a mortal, living flaw. Yours? They’re all real.”
She stared straight ahead. Listening, perhaps. Or just waiting before she continued her monologue.
“There’s so much of yourself you don’t know. That I don’t know. Bits and pieces of you, crammed together. And look what it made? A mess.”
Laughter.
“You could have been their friend. You could have tried. But you killed her. For a second. And now look where we are. Look where we are, Toren.”
Her eyes flashed purple in the void.
“Sorry. I don’t want to torture you. That’s your job. What a silly little skeleton you are. We are. We’re both in trouble, you know. Big trouble.”
Her voice. It was a combination of Erin and Toren. A mix of that…and someone else. Nekhti tilted her head back and forth.
“We’re in this together. You and me. So I’m giving you some hints. Advice, really. As much as I can. Because even I don’t know…all of it. I just appeared a while back. But we’re in trouble. We could die.”
A pause. Nekhti traced a circle in the air with one finger, impatiently.
“As much as we can die. And it wouldn’t be a good thing. I want to keep existing. So do you. But you’re in charge. You have to let me out. Or—not. It would be very bad if I were let out now. But I have some of the things you need. I have a voice.”
Laughter, faint and mocking. Nekhti looked up, and down, and around, as if searching.
“I think—I might even leave you. If that happens, it happens. It’s likely, actually. But you have to find me. I will be here, now that you helped make me. What will happen? Wait and see. But you have the key. Yes, you.”
A poke through nothing. Nekhti leaned in, grinning. And her voice was fading.
“Remember. You have the key. Keep existing. And surely—you’ll meet her again. Your time will come again, if you try it. You were never meant to exist. And you were born of that tragedy. I have seen your suffering. But you can find your desires. So—live and suffer.”
Her burning, purple gaze behind the mask suddenly was everything and anything. Nekhti spoke. Laughter in her voice.
