Interlude – Songs and Stories

Somo was a bit smarter, though, and smacked him so hard Kevin saw the ground actually move a bit under his feet. The Ogre, cross-eyed, slunk back in line as she snapped.
“No death! No death! Goblins wrong!”
She waved a club. Instantly, Poisonbite went for the dagger at her wrist. She casually held a deadly, glowing blade coated in poison as she pretended to fiddle with Kevin’s bindings, smiling at him. She was ready to turn and throw, but Taganchiel gave her a warning look.
“Not die if we can help it, Somo. Come, climb.”
“No. Goblins wrong. Not die. Not climb. Better…way.”
Somo was conferring with the other Ogres. She frowned mightily, sniffed the air, and checked the mountains nearest to her. She looked at the others.
“Close?”
They were doing the same things as her. But they apparently couldn’t tell, so one got a better sense. Not by checking the mountain, but by stomping over to the nearest tree, tearing off a branch, and munching on it. Another scooped up some dirt, found a stone, and began to chew.
The Goblins and Kevin both stared. Yet Somo got an answer as an Ogre nodded. She turned to Taganchiel.
“Not climb. Better way. Maybe die. Maybe. Humans die too. Not follow long.”
She stressed ‘maybe’ as if it was a huge accomplishment. Which, to be fair…Taganchiel raised his brows.
“Redfangs don’t know other way.”
“Red-fang. Not Ogres. Ogres know hills. Ogres go…here.”
Somo made a snorting sound and spat. She gestured around the lower-lying areas of the High Passes on the Human’s side, which, to be fair, the Redfang Tribe had seldom if ever colonized. If other Tribes had, they weren’t here and had died.
Ogres had more staying power. Ogres had memory. Ogres were also not like onions and got no jokes in that regard, Kevin had learned.
“Tastes like old place. Old place. We not go up. We go there.”
Somo pointed. Apparently they knew something. The Goblins began to move, after the short break, and the jogging Ogres were suddenly leading. They broke out of the narrow forest they’d been using for cover, yet there was a confidence that sped the step. Taganchiel asked the obvious.
“Where are we going?”
“Down. Bad. Dangerous. Maybe die. Maybe. Humans not follow long. Not stay long. Bad stay long. Maybe die. Maybe…”
Somo repeated herself. Getting nervous. And she hadn’t been nervous, even when she heard they were raiding Tenbault. She’d only demanded a 60% cut of all mana potions seized.
Kevin traded a glance with Poisonbite. Taganchiel patiently raised his eyebrows.
“Where are we going, Somo?”
“Down. Into dark place. Ogres know. Ogres came. Ogres…don’t go anymore.”
Kevin…really didn’t like the sound of that. But it still beat having no place at all. He gulped.
“What’s down there, Somo? You sound nervous. Uh, what’s there to fear?”
Her head turned. She did not look confident at all.
“Thing many Ogres die. Place big clan once go. Five…no, fifteen lives ago.”
Fifteen lives? Oh, she meant fifteen generations. Kevin wondered how long that was. Ogres could live a long time…he licked his lips.
“What tribe? What happened? What’s there?”
“Maybe gone. Maybe all gone!”
Somo looked happy at the idea. Then she frowned.
“Maybe still there. Big clan die. Somo and nine Ogres and Goblins…not live long. Humans die too, though.”
That seemed to be some consolation. Kevin really didn’t like this. Taganchiel didn’t either.
“What tribe?”
“Thousand Warriors Clan.”
Kevin traded a look with the others. One of the surviving Redfangs slowly began checking her weapons, grinning as her friend traced new lines of red on her skin. Somo waited.
“Want know why clan famous?”
