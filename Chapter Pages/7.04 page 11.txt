Bird bowed his head lower. Lyonette nodded.
“Just—don’t do it again, okay, Bird?”
“Yes.”
The Worker kept nodding. Erin and Lyonette rose. Bird looked up.
“Am I forgiven?”
“Yes. And I’m really sorry Klbkch hit you.”
Erin hugged Bird. He smiled, relieved. Then he paused.
“May I hunt birds tomorrow?”
Erin’s smile vanished. She stared at Bird.
“No.”
“In three days?”
“No, Bird. No birds for a week.”
“…In six days?”
There he was again, Bird and serious Bird. Erin stood up. What would her mother have said? Erin should have thought of that from the beginning. She pointed sternly at Bird.
“No arguing, young miss…ter! Or it’ll be even longer!”
Bird clapped all four hands over his mandibles in horror.
“I will not argue! Do not make it longer, please!”
“Well—well, just you think about what you’ve done! You can help build your tower, or play chess—but no hunting or eating Birds!”
“Yes. And—and we love you, but that’s final!”
Lyonette and Erin looked at each other. They exited the room before they could make any more mistakes. They shut the door, leaned against it, and listened. For a second there was only silence. Erin was afraid Bird would start crying, but after a moment, she heard a sing-song voice, warbling from within.
“Now I am sad. Because I have been bad. This is my bad bird song, which is all I can do because I cannot eat birds. Which is sad.”
Erin and Lyonette nodded to each other. They hurried down the hallway, and then downstairs, and then they high-fived in relief. They’d done it. Erin was no parent, but she did have a family. She wondered if she’d ever been like that.
Probably n—Erin caught herself. Definitely. And Bird was reasonable. More than a child. She sighed in relief.
In his room, Bird kept singing. He was gloomy. He was being punished. No birds! But he had done a bad thing. He was not dead, too, and Erin had not thrown him out of the inn so the Free Queen could tear Bird apart and make True Antinium maybe.
So…victory?
“Yay.”
Bird threw up his four arms. He stared around. If not Birds, then what?
The maggot wriggled in the corner of the room. Bird stared at it. He could build his tower. But an entire week. It was almost as bad as if Klbkch had broken open Bird’s head. Almost.
“So sad. Because I was bad.”
The Worker wandered over to the maggot. Maybe—his Level 8 [Tactician] class told Bird something. Maybe he could feed birds. For an entire week? Yes! And they would fly around him and he would not be eating or hunting them. Bird trundled over to the window and put the maggot just outside the window. Yes. He would earn the birds’ trust.
This was a good plan. Bird heard the door open and jumped.
“I was not hunting!”
He shut the window quickly. But it was not Lyonette or Erin. Instead, Bird saw a green figure with glowing, crimson eyes.
“Oh. Numbtongue.”
The Hobgoblin [Bard] nodded to Bird. He sidled into the room, carefully looking down the hallway for the two young Human women.
“Bird.”
“I am in trouble and being punished. I cannot hunt or eat birds. I am sad. But I did a bad thing.”
Bird announced. The [Bard] shrugged. He was carrying something behind him. Bird saw him wander over to the chair. The Hobgoblin smiled.
“Saw the fighting. Good shooting.”
He sounded approving. Bird tilted his head.
“I shot many birds.”
The Goblin nodded. He and Bird hadn’t talked—much. But they had lived in the same inn for a while, after Bird had recovered. Numbtongue had even apologized for the sword and Greydath, but it had not been his fault. Bird had said sorry that all Numbtongue’s friends were dead.
