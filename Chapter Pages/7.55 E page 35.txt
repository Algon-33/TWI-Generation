“As for the price, your Majesty? Well, as we said, it could be an act of [Witches]. However…if the Unseen Empire would like to involve itself in our action—”
“Take credit, you mean.”
Perhaps a little too direct, there. Eloise looks a bit offended.
“Declare itself the beneficiary of [Witches], and my work at your request as an example of that pact, your Majesty. We would accept that. And…some land.”
I’m sure if I could see them, both Mavika and Eloise’s eyes would do that ‘glinting’ thing I’ve read about. I always wanted to know if it was actually a physical motion or just an impression.
“Land, Witch Eloise?”
“Land, your Majesty. In perpetuity. A place for [Witches].”
“…You don’t just mean, Witching Street, [Witch] Eloise. Do you?”
She smiles. I know she does.
“We may discuss the issue. But if we were given a…small forest? We would consider ourselves in your debt.”
I sit back. [Witches] want to practice witchery more witchily than before. Okay…but if it’s between Lady Rie and Eloise, I know which one to pick. So I smile back.
“We can discuss forests, [Witch] Eloise. Or other locations. We have an agreement in either case. Now—how can you safely uncover the illness? And what might you suggest we do when the cure is found?”
The [Tea Witch]—if that is her class—chuckles. Mavika makes a sound like a bird.
“It is struck, [Emperor]! Let it be that neither [Witch] nor ruler regret this.”
She takes off. Is she literally flying? I hear Gamel and the [Riders] exclaim in alarm. I’ll have to ask. Eloise is slower to rise.
“Oh, it won’t take too long, hopefully, your Majesty. You see, the Circle might be aware of [Witch]’s unique talents, but I doubt they know all of our tricks. Finding what ails the young [Lords] Veltras is not easy. But I am very good. I’ll need help. But I don’t need to be there.”
“What then?”
She laughs as I offer her an arm.
“Divination.”
 
—-
 
Divination. Not [Scrying]. Nor is it like the class [Diviner]. It was something partly lost in this day and age. A different kind of magic. A different technique and way of looking at things.
It looked—
Well, it sounded like cheating to Laken Godart. But that was also very witch-y.
At first—it had all the hallmarks of a true ritual straight out of the fairytales. Eloise did not waste time. Nor—it seemed—had she thought Laken would refuse her.
Multiple covens had come to Riverfarm. Even if not all the members were here and there were more young [Witches]-in-training than before—there were any number of adult [Witches].
Almost all of them were here. Mavika, Oliyaya, Agratha, Devay, Rebeca, Eloise, and more. Wiskeria was admitted into their number; only a handful had been excluded like Hedag.
The others were watching. Apprentice [Witches], a small sea of pointed hats, sat around an inner circle. There was Eloise, with a small magical fire, a pot—multiple pots with ingredients simmering away, emitting noxious fumes—
It was why they were outside. The [Witches] had found a perfect glade. It was, in fact, the forest they would rather like to have. So they worked their magic here.
Laken Godart was one of the onlookers. Durene had come too, and was nervously watching while linking arms with him; just in case she squeezed his hand too tightly.
It began with a chant. The young [Witches] took it up first. It was a whisper. Two names, echoing around the ground in uneven harmony—but it was a harmony.
“Veltras. Veltras. Sammial Veltras. Hethon Veltras. Veltras, Veltras…”
