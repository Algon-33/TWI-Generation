She raised the vial with a trembling hand. The women looked as Maviola brought it closer to her lips. She spoke, quietly.
“I am Lady Maviola El. And this is the death I choose.”
She drank the entire vial down. A full potion’s dose. Ieka gasped. And she saw the old woman change. Her features shifted. In a moment.
One second, an old woman sat in the chair. The next—Ieka blinked. And she saw a woman standing there, regarding her dress. Someone else.
A young woman with sparkling orange hair, like embers, mixed with black. She had a smile made of mischief and passion, and her eyes blazed. She turned, and Desinee was the older of the two.
“Grandmother…?”
A laughter, infectious, crackling with humor. The young woman stretched.
“That’s only what you call me, Desinee. But all my life? I’ve been Maviola. And—I’ve forgotten how it feels to stand. Look at me.”
With some dismay she looked at her body.
“My clothes don’t fit. That I forgot to prepare for. But enough, enough. I have my bag of holding. And that is enough.”
She twirled. And the [Ladies] looked at her. Magnolia Reinhart blinked. Bethal nudged Pryde.
“I did not expect that. I thought she was going to sell it. Isn’t that a waste of money?”
The [Lady] smiled. She looked at Bethal and turned around.
“This is my selfishness. I told you, I’ve prepared for this day for decades. With my own funds. Look. Magnolia, you were only one more piece to my ending. And for that, I thank you. Even the Stitch Witch in her way. But I have been prepared.”
She reached for her side. And pulled out the three objects she always carried with her. And Ieka’s jaw dropped. Because she saw three glowing vials. Each the same color.
Three potions. Each the same as the last. Even Magnolia blinked.
“Saliss of Lights sells his potions rarely. But he does sell a number of them. I used only the money I had. Nothing remains but this.”
Maviola El looked at the three vials. Each one a Potion of Youth. Temporary Youth. She looked around.
“Each one will last a week. And after that?”
She spread her arms. And she smiled.
“That is all. But it is my ending. Youth, a dream. Now, look at me, Desinee. Magnolia Reinhart, you [Ladies] of Izril. I am Lady Maviola El. And I relinquish my position as leader of the House of El. I give it to Lord Deilan El.”
A gasp from Desinee. And the [Ladies] stirred. Maviola turned her head. Looking around. Staring at the ground, the sky, as if it was all new again. She turned.
“What will you do with your time? My estates are open, and my carriage, if you have any wish.”
Magnolia looked at Maviola respectfully. The [Lady] laughed, younger than Magnolia by half. Almost scornfully.
“I don’t need wealth. I want something else. Something new. I will not trouble any of you. I am no longer of the House of El. I will be just Maviola. I will be…”
She paused.
“I had a name, once. A nickname. ‘Lady Firestarter’. That was what they called me, when I was a girl. But only I remember why. Yet, for a moment, let me be her again. Goodbye, all of you. I hope you live the lives you want.”
Nothing more. She turned and began walking out of the field. And the [Ladies] of Izril—knelt.
They curtsied, or bowed, some of them. And they knelt as the young woman passed them by. To age, to the passing of the House of El’s scion.
To her. And a word that Ieka held in her house, that chased away Belavierr’s whispers.
