“Helmets. Coif. Vambraces. Oil. Whetstone. Spear. Glaive. Zweihander. Scimitar. Bardiche. Buckler. Pauldrons…”
It was like he’d memorized a dictionary of words that only pertained to weapons and armor. Erin stared at Shorthilt began listing off an armory’s worth of items. She eventually cut him off.
“You want all that?”
“Some.”
The Hob nodded eagerly. The other Redfang Warriors nodded with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Rabbiteater grumbled and made it clear that he wanted some food. But Shorthilt was adamant. Erin wavered.
“Well, I can get you some of that. Some. But the money will also go to food. For the Goblins?”
The Hobs nodded at that. They looked satisfied, punching each other on the shoulder good-naturedly. In fact, they looked quite happy. Erin stared at them, mystified, and then pointed to the axe.
“Ilvriss also gave you that. There’s only one, but it’s all he’s willing to give you. So…”
The Hobs froze. They stared at the enchanted axe. They looked at Erin. Numbtongue inhaled sharply.
“For us?”
Erin nodded. The Hobs stared at each other. Then as one they leapt for the axe.
“Whoa!”
Erin jumped back. The adventurers backed up as the five Goblins all tried to grab the axe. They fell, punching and kicking each other for it. Erin shouted and waved her arms for them to stop, but the Hobs didn’t listen. The first to emerge from the pile was Headscratcher. He pried Shorthilt’s hands off the axe and lifted it over his head, crowing.
“Mine!”
The Hobs all stared at him. Shorthilt groaned and smacked his forehead on the floor. Glumly, the other four got up and scuffed at the ground with their feet. Erin stared.
“Wait, that was it?”
Headscratcher nodded. He swung the axe carefully as the other Hobs glared at him. Apparently, they’d decided who would get the axe with the simplest of trials. Ceria looked at her team.
“Wanna try that for our next artifact?”
Yvlon laughed. Pisces just sniffed. The Hobs clustered around Headscratcher, disappointment forgotten as he let them try the axe. He looked at Erin and she was surprised to see a bit of moisture in his eyes. Headscratcher nearly teared up. He kept elbowing Numbtongue until the Goblin translated.
“Very good. Very good. He says thank you.”
Erin raised her hands.
“I didn’t do much. Look, Headscratcher, aw, don’t cry. I’m glad you like it. But it’s not what you deserve. You should get two more artifacts. OR gold!”
The Hobs stared at the pile of gold dismissively. They shook their heads. Numbtongue looked confused. He looked at Erin.
“Why so important? For buying?”
Revi raised her eyebrows. Jelaqua laughed. Erin nodded.
“It’s important! Very important. If you had more, you could buy…tons of good stuff! All of the others want it.”
The Hobs looked at the adventurers. They nodded. Halrac looked stonily past the Goblins. Jelaqua scratched her neck and sighed.
“Yeah, it’s important. We might not get anything good. And—hell, it is a bit depressing.”
“Why’s that?”
Lyonette held Mrsha up. The Gnoll sniffed Jelaqua as the Selphid shrugged.
“It’s nothing. Okay—look. It’s just that we might not get any artifacts. Or if we do, we get one. And it’s…well, it’s hard after fighting in the dungeon for so long, you know? After so much…”
She glanced at Griffon Hunt and away. The other adventurers nodded. Jelaqua spread her arms out.
“Sorry. I know I’m griping. But the other teams will get a share of the loot and that’s fair. But we—well, we were here first, you know? And we’re not getting much.”
“Yeah.”
Seborn nodded. Typhenous leaned on his staff.
