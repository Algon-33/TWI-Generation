The others chattered merrily. One reached for the iPhone, and the other swatted it away. Ryoka was just staring. They were so casual. Then the one with the iPhone blinked and tapped it. The glowing screen had a complicated lock on it.
“Huh. Password…? What is this?”
“Give it here! This yours, Miss Runner?”
Laughing, the one with two daggers stowed a blade and caught the iPhone. They wiggled it in front of Ryoka. She shivered.
“No—I was delivering it. I have no idea what it is.”
Lie. The [Raider] looked disappointed, but brightened.
“Well, that’s half the fun. Figuring out what it does. Say—who wants it?”
Half the group raised their hands. The one with the spear leaned on it and looked at Ryoka.
“I’ll forfeit the—whateverthatis—if I can have this one. I could use a [Slave]. Anyone got one of Roshal’s collars? It’d be hard to smuggle past ██ ██████, but I could send her to Roshal first.”
They laughed as they pointed at Ryoka. The leader shrugged. They had a bow and arrow; they’d put away the wand, and were busily stringing it.
“We’ve got a schedule to keep. The Bloodfeast is waiting. One hour. You want her? Knock her out or spell her and tie her up.”
“Great. Thanks.”
The spear rose. Ryoka tensed. No. And the one with daggers raised ███ hand.
“Hold on. I say we let her go. What about this? Five minutes head start, then we follow her?”
The other [Raiders] looked at the one who’d spoken. The one with the spear was put out.
“Why? It’s more fun for me.”
“I like her. She’s a Runner. It’s amusing to see what she does. Hey. Miss Runner.”
The [Raider] came close. The mask leered at Ryoka, two painted golden dots for eyes revealing ███████ ██████. The [Raider] spoke.
“You can run away and we won’t follow. But we’re going towards that city. You know it?”
She pointed down the road. Ryoka shivered.
“Celum.”
A grin behind the mask that Ryoka sensed rather than saw.
“That’s right! And we’re going to kill all of them unless someone brave warns them. And everyone on the road. What are you going to do? Boss?”
She looked at the leader. The [Raider] with the bow hesitated, and then waved a hand and laughed.
“I like it. Five minutes? Miss Runner. If we see you again—you die. Make your choice.”
The other [Raiders] agreed, chuckling with anticipation. They were so—casual. One of them peered up at the skies, pulled something out.
A scroll.
“Just enough time for me to get rid of that damned rain. Run along, little Runner.”
Ryoka lowered her hands. She looked around. The one with the spear was annoyed, but he brightened when someone whispered that he could catch her if she was too slow. The others just looked at her.
“I can—go?”
The [Raider] with the iPhone flipped it up, caught it. They peered at the password screen and then looked at Ryoka.
“You have four minutes and forty seconds. I like you, Ryoka. If you live—I’m going to remember your name.”
They were smiling. All of them. Ryoka Griffin looked around. And she saw.
What little monsters. Not even grand evil, like Az’kerash or Belavierr. What little—terribly mundane evil. Like people from her world. Not magnificent darkness. Just petty and terrible. They enjoyed killing. They wanted to see her run.
The carriage smelled of burnt flesh and ash as the fire finally went out. Ryoka looked around. This was evil from her world. The same petty madness as someone with a gun.
“How small.”
