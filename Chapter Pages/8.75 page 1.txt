Her class, her levels, her journey were a continuation of the one she’d taken with the Singer of Terandria. So, context? Context was lacking, and it was going to be a problem. But at last she had found it. A strange road that she’d stepped onto. Seraphel du Marquin heard a voice.
 
[Deathtouch Princess Level 27!]
 
[Skill Change – Royal Slap → Ghost’s Hand!]
[Skill Consolidation: Deft Hand removed!]
 
[Skill – Hearts of Courage obtained!]
[Reputation: Infamy, Now My Fame obtained!]
 
[Skill – Royal Bodyguard: Two of Life, Two of Death obtained!]
[Order – Induction: Royal Bodyguard granted.]
 
[Skill – Lesser Toughness obtained!]
 
Her eyes snapped open at the massive, conflicting, strange boons granted. Her thoughts mixed and mingled.
Oh no. Oh yes!
In the background of it all, she could swear she heard someone shouting at her.
“Wear armor, stupid!”
 
——
 
Among the many and varied level-ups, not all entirely welcome…the most notable and arguably the most levels gained came to one person. One man.
 
[Diligent Lord Level 27!]
 
Amazing! It was rare for a [Lord]-type class to gain six levels in one event. In one battle! At twenty-eight years old, Lord Tyrion Veltras…
Would have been ecstatic about that. Especially since, even at twenty-eight years old, he had been embarrassingly older in age than levels as a Level 21 [Lord] at the time. Now, by the grace of having triumphed over a foe with no peer, risking his life day after day in a battle that had tested him to his last—
He was now twenty levels behind where he had once been. Lord Tyrion Veltras listened, so bone-weary with shock he didn’t even truly wake as a list of notifications he had never quite heard in that way played in his head.
 
[Skill – Lightning Hooves restored!]
[Skill – Fourfold Strike restored!]
[Skill—
 
Some were Skills he had once had and gained at that time. Others? [Fourfold Strike] would later consolidate into [Lancing Hydrastrike].
They felt…different in his mind, too. Almost cooler, as if there were some difference to regaining the Skills. If he had to describe it, well, he’d describe it like a breeze. Blue?
He remembered now—Level 21. His parents had been alive. This would be before the Second Antinium Wars, and unlike Magnolia Reinhart, he had not ridden to aid the Drakes. She had passed him around that time.
Tyrion Veltras would make his name and gain the most levels and come into his own during the disaster of the Goblin King’s rampage, as he took up the mantle of House Veltras. If Dioname had thrown him only…ten years instead of sixteen, he might have kept the lion’s portion of his strength.
Instead, he listened, waiting to hear the same Skills reobtained. What would this mean for House Veltras? The war? Jericha had more levels than he did, now. He would have to abdicate at once. But no one could know; it would be disastrous.
However, something did change. Tyrion heard a different set of words than he had, long ago. Amidst all the other Skills he’d regained, there were two that were…new.
 
[Skill – Greater Resistance: Chronos obtained!]
[Skill – A Second of Time obtained!]
 
Those sounded like…well, the first sounded highly situational and too late by far. But the second? That sounded…valuable.
Still, between that and twenty levels and just as many Skills, Tyrion knew which one he’d pick. Small blessings. He could only assume they had come from deed. Slaying the Great General of Ages had granted him a vestige of her power; it was not uncommon.
