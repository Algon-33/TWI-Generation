Six Griffins and their riders landed in front of the mercenary company of thirty riders or so. And in front of them, the one who had called out, was a man.
He was in his late twenties. And the [Farmer] and family of Kaliv gasped when they saw him.
“The Griffin Prince.”
The famed disgrace of Kaliv. The [Prince] who had been banished, never to return to his home city. That he had returned once in recent memory, dying, as the Stitch Witch was nearly ended—was almost unknown outside of Kaliv’s royal court.
To everyone else, he was only The Griffin Prince. His name had been stricken. To say it was anathema.
But he was still a [Prince] of Kaliv. And he roamed the border. The [Sword Captain] cursed as he backed up. He’d been afraid of just this.
“Stay back! By order of his Majesty—”
“King Itorin does not rule here. Take your men and go.”
The [Griffin Prince] thundered. He was physically fit, a warrior, armed with a long spear for use from Griffin-back. He, like the other five accompanying him, were also armed with bows.
[Griffin Riders]. One of them, a young woman, had her bow drawn and was aiming it at the [Sword Captain]’s face.
“Lily. Lower your bow.”
The Griffin Prince snapped at her. He dismounted, as the Royal Griffin, largest of its kind, snapped at the horses. But there were only six Griffins and their riders and the mercenaries outnumbered them five-to-one.
And they were high-level. So was the [Sword Captain]. He advanced in a careful walk, on the balls of his feet. His sword was held at the ready.
“We obey only his Majesty, [Prince] of Kaliv. This farm will be burned. Stand aside or die.”
Lily. Or Lillian Woods, saw the [Sword Captain] tense. She had the arrow in her bow, ready to draw and fire. But the Griffin Prince had signaled her to stand down. She could feel the other [Griffin Riders] tense as well.
The young woman was ready to attack. Her Griffin was too. She had killed people in this world before. Learned how to shoot a bow. But she’d known what that felt like a long time before that.
She was a [Murderer]. And then a [Bandit]. Now—she was a [Griffin Raider], flying in the Griffin Prince’s escort.
But The Griffin Prince was the one on the ground. He had an axe for combat in close quarters. Now, he drew it, and the buckler he carried.
“I have sworn never to let an enemy despoil Kaliv. If you do not retreat, my warriors and I will cut you all down. This is your last warning.”
“We refuse.”
The [Sword Captain] sneered. The [Mercenaries] were tensed, ready for action. So were the [Griffin Riders]. But the two leaders were closest. The Griffin Prince tensed as the [Farmers] drew back. The [Sword Captain] narrowed his eyes.
The [Prince] charged with a roar. His axe came up. The young man was strong and fast. But the [Sword Captain] had surpassed Level 30 eight years ago.
He dodged like quicksilver. His sword lanced out and The Griffin Prince blocked the tip of the sword, knocking it aside with the buckler. He staggered, cut as he stepped back. The [Sword Captain] slashed twice, impossible quick.
“Damn. His Majesty’s outclassed.”
Lily heard another of the riders curse. The Griffin Prince blocked one strike, but the second slashed him down the side. His blood ran through his leather armor, which had parted before the magic weapon.
“Wait.”
The [Murderer] snapped. The other riders looked at her, but they held still. The [Prince] checked himself.
