“But your class—”
Pawn didn’t know what to say. Lyonette was a [Princess]. She was…royalty. As close to his Queen as anything in this world. He knew that was not the same, but it was how he understood her class. It made Lyonette important. How could she not be sad? But Lyonette didn’t seem to see it that way. She cast around.
“You should sit. There’s a chair over there.”
“I will take it. Thank you.”
Awkwardly, Pawn pulled the chair over and sat. He was still higher up than Lyonette and he found himself looking down at her. She sat up and he waited.
“It’s not a big deal, Pawn. I shouldn’t be crying. I shouldn’t. I lost my class because I wasn’t doing [Princess]-like things. That’s all. But I don’t need the class. I was only—only Level 6 anyways.”
“But it was your class.”
“I know. But I haven’t been feeling like a princess in a while. I think I knew it. That’s why I lost my class. And it’s not like I need it.”
“But—”
Pawn didn’t know what to say. He trailed off, staring at Lyonette. Tears flowed down her face and her nose was wet. She wiped it, looking embarrassed and Pawn looked away.
“Surely it was important, though. You are a [Princess]. Were. Was that class not important to you?”
“It was. But I lost it, Pawn.”
Lyonette whispered. She shook her head. Pawn realized he was repeating himself. After a while, he spoke.
“What was it like?”
“What?”
“Living as a princess.”
Lyonette looked up at him. Pawn saw Mrsha raise her head. She smiled sadly.
“What was it like? Being a [Princess] was—well, it was nice at times. I loved the balls and dancing and exciting things that came to court. And travelling wherever I wanted in the kingdom. Having money to buy whatever clothing I wanted. But I wasn’t happy. I never leveled. And when I came here, I gave all that up. So I traded being a [Princess] for actually leveling. That’s why—”
She broke off and sniffed, then blew her nose wetly into the handkerchief. Pawn waited. He was confused.
“Balls? Dancing? Why can you not do any of that here?”
“There aren’t any. No one knows I’m a [Princess].”
“But Mrsha has a ball.”
Pawn pointed at it. Lyonette stared and then laughed abruptly.
“Pawn, that’s not the same! A ball is a formal occasion. It’s where we dress up in fancy clothing and dance in a big open space. It’s not like anything Liscor has. It’s another world. A different world. I left it behind.”
“Which is why you lost your class.”
“Yes. Do you understand?”
He thought he did. It was just that he didn’t understand why Lyonette didn’t want her class back. Pawn mulled it over before he decided he had to ask.
“Why don’t you want it back?”
“Why? Because it’s gone. Because it doesn’t matter.”
“But it was your class. Surely you had Skills—”
“Two. Two, Pawn. And they weren’t that useful. They were—useless. Like my class. It’s gone and I’ll be better. I just need to cry. I don’t know why I’m crying. I should be okay. I just need a day. Then I’ll be better.”
“I see.”
Was that it? Pawn fumbled, searching for something else to say. There had to be something he could say that would make Lyonette feel better. Or—or help her.
“You’re sure you don’t want your class back? I could pray. I could.”
Lyonette laughed weakly.
“I’m sure! Pawn, I appreciate it but all I want is to be alone for a while. I’m glad you came by, I really am. But I just need to be alone.”
“I understand. I will excuse myself. Please forgive me for interrupting you.”
Pawn stood up at once. He felt embarrassed and bad. Lyonette looked up, worried.
“No, I’m not angry! Thank you for coming. It’s just—”
She waved a helpless hand. Pawn nodded.
