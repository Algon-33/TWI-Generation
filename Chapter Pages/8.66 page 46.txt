Blind, deaf, and wounded, Nokha thrashed until someone bound her and kicked her in the sides. Then she curled up.
She was so close! The Raskghar snarled. Almost. Almost! It wasn’t fair.
“I almost had that…prey. Almost. I almost had the white Gnoll.”
The Raskghar growled into the dirt. She did not weep. Prey wept. But she couldn’t help but moan. She didn’t see Ulcre or Merish stop in their tracks. The [Shaman] looked back, and Merish stiffened. Ulcre looked at him and breathed as he whirled.
“Merish. Perhaps your hunt has not ended yet.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: The next chapter will be the last for the month. It’s been some intense writing, and I’m coming to the end of my writing energy.
We’re moving fast. Not all is perfect, but we are doing it. Of course, if in the middle of writing or even after a chapter I really think it needs rework, I will rewrite it. Or even take longer to write a pivotal chapter.
I hope you enjoy this shorter…chapter. Wait, I lied. It’s 28,000 words.
What am I doing? After this volume I promise I’ll do shorter ones. But you can see I’m moving for the end, and I guess that’ll continue. In other news, my next break will contain my birthday at some point, so huge shout out to anyone having their birthday around now—and MelasD, or delta201, who provided the art for this chapter!
That’s all from me. Please send me a new pair of hands. Raskghar hands will do. Aba out.
