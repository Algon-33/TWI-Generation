Relc paused and stared at Pisces. Klbkch closed the door and bowed slightly at Erin.
“Please pardon our intrusion. Is this establishment open for business?”
“What? Oh. Yeah.”
Erin scrambled for words. Relc was still staring at Pisces who studiously ignored him as he refilled his cup.
“It’s been a while. I guess. But come in. Or come in more. Have a seat. Want something to eat?”
“If you would be so kind.”
Klbkch wiped his feet and stepped over to a table. Relc was still staring.
“You multiplied. Can Humans do that?”
“What? Oh no, that’s just Pisces. He’s annoying so ignore him.”
Erin waved Relc over to a seat as she went to the kitchen for plates.
Relc kept staring until Klbkch kicked him and motioned him to a seat.
“I believe staring is considered rude in most cultures. Sit down and cease your rudeness.”
Relc glared and sat. Klbkch turned and nodded to Pisces.
“Please excuse my companion’s rudeness.”
Pisces waved his fork airily.
“I paid no attention. The plebian masses are a burden to be endured; I bear no ill will to the misinformed or ignorant for their rudeness.”
Klbkch and Relc exchanged a glance.
“Indeed. It’s been nice to make your acquaintance.”
“Humans. They’re so—”
“Do you guys want pasta or blue fruit?”
Erin reemerged from the kitchen, trying to hold a pot of hot noodles and several plates with only two hands.
“Ah. Eh. Um, what I meant was—”
“I would be delighted to try the blue fruit. I believe my tongue-tied partner would like some as well.”
“Right. Food. I’ll have some.”
“And me. A second plate and a refill of my drink, if you would.”
Pisces waved his fork. Erin glared again.
“You want pasta? It’s in the kitchen. Get it yourself.”
Turning her back on him, Erin smiled at Relc and Klbkch.
“So um, hi again. It’s been a while. Klbkch and…?”
Klbkch nodded while Relc looked expectant.
“Um. Uh…”
“Relc.”
Klbkch murmured softly.
“Relc! Right, right.”
“What? How come you remembered this idiot’s name and not mine?”
Relc looked aggrieved. Erin blushed.
“Um, sorry.”
“Aren’t I the better looking one here? What gives?”
“Sorry. It’s just—uh, you know. I’ve got a bad memory.”
“Really?”
“…No. Sorry. It’s just been a busy two days.”
“Oh.”
He looked deflated. Erin tried to cheer him up.
“I’ve got more pasta. Well, it’s old pasta but it still tastes good! And more blue juice. And blue fruit! It’s uh, not poisonous if you only eat the outer bit.”
“Ooh, pasta!”
Relc perked up instantly. Erin went to fetch the pasta and placed two steaming plates in front of the two.
“My thanks.”
Klbkch nodded at Erin and both began eating. Around mouthfuls, Relc eyed Erin and then Pisces.
“So, how’re you doing? Level up again?”
“Actually, I did. Right after you two left.”
“Ooh, congratulations! Did you get a new skill?”
“[Basic Crafting]. It helped me make a basket out of grass.”
“That’s quite useful! Most craftsman and artisan classes get that early on. I guess innkeepers are sorta like that, right? Got to take care of the inn, repair windows, fix tables, and all that.”
“I guess. I haven’t ever tried that and besides, I don’t have a hammer. Actually, I’ve never swung a hammer in my life.”
“Well, you’ve got the skill for it, so it’ll be a breeze. And you can buy a hammer no problem. Just head down to the city and you can get a good one for only a silver coin or two. Tell you what, if you’re ever in the area I’ll help you get one at a discount.”
“Really? That’s really generous. Thank you.”
Erin smiled hesitatingly at Relc who grinned back at her as he slurped down a noodle. Klbkch set down his fork and nodded at his companion.
