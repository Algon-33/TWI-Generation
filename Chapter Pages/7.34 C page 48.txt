“Some live. But that is no Giant.”
Ser Vorn stared at the distant figure. It was made up of the vast, coiling serpents. But—it was not one thing. Each one was a serpent or worm, the size of giant, twisting trees, but far wider. Vast—they formed a humanoid figure. Roughly…humanoid.
“Enemy on approach! Get me Huntress Delezza! Identify it! Sir Richard! Sir Tom, to me!”
The Bastion-General was bellowing. The [Demon Huntress] stared at the distant figure. It was coming forwards, each step covering hundreds of feet.
“I have no idea what that is. And I know every giant monster. That’s new.”
New. The word swept the walls in horror. New—the same word that had been applied to the Crelers. Antinium.
“There’s only one of it, though.”
Springwaters aimed with a bow, though it was far out of range even for his arrow. Cirille nodded. She saw the Bone Behemoth—now far smaller in size—moving forwards.
“Prepare summoning spells and siege spells! We will bring it down at range!”
The Bastion-General’s voice was confident. The distant monster was moving slowly, and the undulating serpents were individuals. It could be killed. It could die.
Thump.
As it took another step, the world shook. These walls weren’t spelled. Cirille felt it at a distance. But then something else.
 
Thump. Thumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthump…
Thump. Thumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthump…
 
“What is that…sound?”
The Drake stared at the distant serpent-titan. Or whatever it was. She narrowed her eyes.
“Wait. What is it doing…?”
She saw something happening as it drew nearer. Part of the titan—no, it’s entire body just—fell away. It stiffened; not flesh or bone, but something like cartilage. Like that left from a snake, stiffening.
“It’s…shedding. Growing smaller.”
Each step, the titan was shrinking.
“It’s not going to even get here. It’s losing mass.”
Richard had an enchanted seeing eyeglass. Tom giggled; he snatched it from the [Knight]’s hands.
“Did someone say one? You idiots.”
He pointed. And Cirille saw.
 
Thump. Thumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthump…
 
That wasn’t one footstep. It was…dozens. She narrowed her eyes.
“Behind it. What is—Ancestors.”
The titan took a step. And a beat behind it, she saw—no, it had looked like one thing. But now she saw it shedding, dividing.
Creating a larger clone. The real thing shrunk, by one layer. And the clones it shed copied it.
Not one titan. Not two, or ten. Dozens, the first the colossus that had been seen. The smaller ones shrinking. But so many.
Thump.
It was coming to 5th Wall. The Bastion-General’s voice was quite calm. But Cirille heard the current underneath.
“Change the alarm to 4th Wall and the capital. Inform them this is a new monster. A titan, capable perhaps of limitless division. Perhaps one. Perhaps one of many. We will hold 5th Wall until it dies. It is not alone. The Demons are coming.”
He pointed. Cirille saw more shapes moving, flanking the monster. Humanoids, smaller. Demons. Those standing on the 5th Wall stirred. Tom laughed.
“If we fall, 4th Wall must hold. We will relay information about this threat until it is no longer possible. Beginning with siege spells. Commanders. Prepare for combat.”
The Bastion-General’s voice filled the air. And behind it—the [Clown]’s laughter. He laughed and laughed.
“It’s another day in Rhir! Everyone’s going to die. Except me.”
 
 
Author’s Note: This was hard, mainly because I had real life kicking me in the shins. I don’t know if I cut at 24,000 words or kept the entire 30,000; either way, you can tell this an arc.
