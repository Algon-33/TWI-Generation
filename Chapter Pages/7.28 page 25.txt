Erin was turning to the second ingredient. It was onyx. A few gems that Numbtongue had found.
“This is also dark.”
“It’s a gemstone. Can you eat rocks?”
Palt looked nervously at Octavia and Numbtongue. Both nodded, casually. Pyrite would have loved to see this. For a moment—a minute—Numbtongue became him.
“Here. I can grind.”
The Hobgoblin helped Erin as she found a mortar and pestle. He easily ground the rocks with his hands. Even chewed one up and spat it into a bowl. Palt gave Numbtongue a wide-eyed look. Erin nodded.
“Good.”
The ground-up onyx went into the pot. And already—the pot was dark. But still glowing.
“I want this Skill.”
Octavia muttered. It was just—bypassing a lot of what she knew as alchemy. But Erin wasn’t listening. She was following the idea in her head.
The third item was charcoal. Erin smashed it up and dumped a pound into the pot. Palt had to object here.
“Oh come on. That’s not good for you.”
“I need something dark.”
Erin muttered. She looked around. She had—well—it was like when she’d made food for the faeries.
Part of it was silly. Childish. Like a girl pretending to make magic. But that belief was what made the magic in the first place. This would hide people.
“One soup to rule them all. One soup to bring them together. And in the darkness blind them.”
“I think she’s losing it.”
Octavia muttered to Palt. Erin grinned. But that was just a joke. In truth—she frowned.
“I don’t think I want a soup.”
The [Illusionist]’s hand meeting his face was loud in the silence. Erin frowned.
“I think—I’m imagining balls.”
“Balls?”
The Centaur frowned. Erin nodded. She was imagining…it was so clear in her head.
“They’re…powdery. Like dough-balls. Small, but powdery. You roll them up and then you pop one into your mouth.”
She was sure that’s what it looked like. Octavia, Numbtongue, and Palt exchanged a glance. Erin looked sure, now.
“Flour. Is there black flour?”
Erin was hunting through the bags of ingredients. Palt cleared his throat.
“Actually, there is. There’s a kind of wheat. Noelictus exports it.”
The [Innkeeper]’s head rose.
“Yes. That. I need it.”
“Um…we could order some?”
Octavia helplessly looked at the others. Erin’s face fell.
“No flour?”
She was sure she needed it. Octavia shook her head helplessly. Erin frowned.
“Maybe…some regular flour works? I need a lot of it. To make this thick. It can’t be a soup. That’s how it can start, but—”
Distractedly, she began pouring in flour to the pot. Bags and bags of it. Palt looked concerned.
“There’s surely enough ink in the pot to dye whatever you need—”
“It has to be dark! It’s a theme! The flour makes it too not-dark!”
Erin snapped. She could see the recipe struggling to adapt. Not dark enough! She cursed, added some other powder.
“Baking soda?”
Octavia saw Erin pouring a lot in. the [Innkeeper] scowled at her brew. It was indeed turning grey, not entirely black. She had to adapt. This would be—ashy. Well, that worked.
“I need some dust. Ash.”
“Potash? I have some.”
“Yeah. Yeah. So—okay. We’re mixing white and black now. To get grey. This will be like dustclouds. Um—um—”
The image changed in Erin’s head. She was imagining bread now. Bread, like dust. Her eyes snapped open.
“Bread?”
“Oh come on.”
Palt objected. The pot was full. But Erin looked at him and she seemed certain.
“Bread works. It’s changing, Palt. Where’re the eggs? We should add more flour—we’re making a dough, now. Hold on.”
The mixture was too thick, practically dusty. But since Erin didn’t have enough darkness—she looked around. Saw some water in a jug. Octavia’s eyes widened.
“Erin, that’s not w—”
