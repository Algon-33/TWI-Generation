Erin looked from face to face. Califor sat with several [Witches], all of whom had created a coven in death. Sserys and a few strong non-Human souls spoke with Yderigrisel and the dead of House Byres. Erin waved a hand.
“Excuse me? Hello? What if they’re…gods? Has anyone suggested that? I mean, isn’t it obvious?”
The ghosts stopped arguing and looked up. One by one they fixed on her. Yderigrisel flapped his wings uncertainly.
“But the gods are dead. Even when I was a child, I was told…”
He looked at her. And Erin thought she felt a shadow even in this place. The heads of all the ghosts turned.
“I just said—”
“Stop. Speaking.”
One of the [Witches] who resembled more of a toad than person hissed at her. Her slitted eyes rolled uneasily.
“You are attracting attention. Someone find the other children. The burning flame was right. This is the answer.”

Even the dead were bound by the phenomenon about dead gods. The children of Earth were not.
Erin Solstice had felt fear when she met Kasigna.
She had felt sorrow when realizing Zel’s sacrifice and Maviola’s loss.
She had felt anger at this strange afterlife.
Now, she felt guilt. Trepidation, as the fainter soul stopped and stared at her in wonder. The ghosts marveled at how real Erin was. But they were still perfect in every detail. She saw darker skin, curious eyes behind glasses. And fear, even now.
One ghost stopped before her. He enunciated carefully.
“Hello. My name is Abel. I’m pleased to meet you.”
Erin hesitated. She slowly took the proffered hand of the young man.
“I’m Erin. I’m…pleased to meet you.”
He nodded. After a moment, he looked at her.
“You’re also from Earth?”
“Yes.”
“He speaks a language unlike ours. He and the other. We wondered at his tales of Earth and a world full of machines and no magic. Ghosts can lie, of course. Now, we know he was telling the truth. He came recently. But longer ago than I.”
Califor regarded the young man. Abel nodded, concentrating to translate. After a moment, he looked at Erin.
“I was eaten. I did not know what happened. I do not know…how I came here. Do you know?”
Erin’s heart sank. She shook her head.
“No. W-what happened exactly? I’m so sorry, Abel. I was like you. I met other people.”
He smiled.
“They are alive? Good. We died. We…”
His face fell. Ghosts could not cry. But he shuddered even so at the memory.
“They came out of the ground. We asked them to save us. They are called Crelers.”
Crelers. Erin’s eyes went wide.
“Abel. Do you know…an Imani?”
He looked at her in shock.
“Imani? She was with us.”
“She’s alive. She—she—”
Erin wiped at her eyes. The young man and Califor watched. Erin looked around.
“This is too much. Why am I here? Why is this here? I don’t want this. This is death? It’s not right.”
“Since when did right or wrong matter?”
Califor regarded her. Erin shuddered. Then she looked at Abel. She expected him to be…angry. Hurt. Sad, any of these emotions and more, but he wasn’t. He just smiled, happy for once.
“I am glad she lived. Please, tell me about her.”
No malice in the dead for the living. Just regret and relief. Erin wiped at her eyes again. Then she told him.

“I’m not dead.”
Erin poked herself in the chest again, just to tell. It didn’t hurt, yet she was still solid. Realer. Califor hovered over her shoulder.
The [Witch] had come to help Erin, despite not ever having met her. Erin hadn’t asked why. Sserys made more sense, strangely.
Zel. Erin thought about it. It was too fast. Realizing she was trapped, fleeing Kasigna and being saved. She had seen him and then he was gone.
