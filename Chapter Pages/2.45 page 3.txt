“Of course there is. The audience is never silent. They gasp and encourage or boo the actors. And sometimes they help. Sometimes they change the story.”
 
“Mm. True. She speaks the truth!”
 
One of the faeries says that. The other smacks her, eliciting a cry of pain. The second faerie glares at me.
 
“You have asked much already. Too much! If we do all for you, what purpose do you serve?”
 
She’s right. I stare at her. I have been asking for their help. I should have been taking care of everything myself.
Without a word I keep running. Something in my body screams, and I swear, it feels like things are breaking—snapping apart in my legs. But I keep running nevertheless.
Faster. I have to run—
A faerie flies by my side. The same one as before. She looks at me.
 
“Ye really are slow, you know.”
 
“I know.”
I close my eyes. It was the only thing I was proud of. But it’s true.
“I know.”
A bit faster. I pump my arms, and my foot pushes off the ground. I can’t really feel them. But who cares?
This might be my last chance.
 
Erin backs away from a skeleton with a sword. It grins at her, empty sockets flashing with purple life. She raises her arms, but it runs her through. Blood bubbles out of her mouth and she grasps at the skeleton. It yanks the sword back and pieces of her come with it. It slowly raises the dripping blade and—
 
Faster. I gasp and cry and run. Just once, please. Please God, or anyone who’s listening. Just let me save one more person.
I did it once. Mrsha. I paid a price. I’ll do it again. No matter what I have to give up. Faeries and Dragons. Immortals. I’ll offer whatever it takes.
But how? I know who might find her. But how can I convince him to help me?
It’s like part of me is screaming at once, running with a thousand emotions in my heart. But another side of me sits in silence, listening to the rushing wind. That other Ryoka in me is thinking. Even if I get to Teriarch in time, how do I convince him?
He’s proud. He’s a Dragon. I’m nothing. He might erase my mind or kill me in an instant. What could I offer him?
Think. Dragons. Old. Immortals. Timeless. Pride?
No. Greed? Wisdom? The desire of immortals is…what does a Dragon want? Virgins on stakes? Cow steaks? Money? Magical items?
It’s impossible. But I have to think of something. Something that would tempt even a Dragon?
The oldest kind. The oldest games. Something timeless. Pride. Challenge the Dragon. Sacrifice and risk. A magic sword.
I—old. He’s old. And he’s prideful? Yes. Something’s there.
Hold on. Pride. Magic sword. Magic? Magic…the oldest games?
Hang on.
I think I know what I have to do. If I can ask him that—how did it go? Red house. Owning cats? Fish?
Try to remember. Cryptology club. Middle school. So long ago. I can reconstruct it. Think of it.
My mind is fuzzy. I’m so tired. How long have I been running? Where did my shoes go? I feel numb. It’s a bad sign. But I’m still running. It feels like it’s been over a day. Or maybe it’s been a few hours?
It doesn’t matter. I can feel the cold wind touching my half-healed stumps. I’ve already lost something. I’ve not lost enough. I would give away the rest if it means I’m not too late for once.
I have to be there in time.
It’s so cold.

High above the girl, the faeries fly in the cold sky. They stare down at her and consider what she’s said. They debate in words no Human could ever understand, and think of what might happen and might be.
