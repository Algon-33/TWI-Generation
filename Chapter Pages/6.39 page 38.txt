“For the appeal. I’m a fraud. Honestly, Numbtongue, if you want a good potion, find a way to get it from Xif. Heck, if Erin sells those Faerie Flowers to him, he might cut her an exclusive deal. And then I’m sure I won’t be needed at the inn.”
“Maybe.”
The Hobgoblin thought Octavia was right. Xif was clearly better. And experienced. And many other things. But in that moment, as Numbtongue looked at the potion that Octavia had walked him through step-by-step, he thought of Xif, and the look on the Gnoll’s face when he saw Numbtongue.
And maybe the Gnoll was nice and Numbtongue hadn’t seen his good side. He’d apologized. But Numbtongue also remembered the [Guards] posted on the door to Pallass. He couldn’t walk around the Walled City. He could barely walk around Liscor. As for Celum…
He looked around Octavia’s shop. Her shop, where she had trusted him to protect her if there were [Thugs]. And then he looked at his pouch and the shiny and, to a Goblin, fairly worthless objects inside.
Octavia was pouring the potion into jars, stoppering them up when she heard the clacking. She turned around. And stared.
“What is—where did you get that?”
Numbtongue paused as he put down a bit of silver next to some mana stones, an emerald, and other collections from the mountain. Some were his. Others had been mined by Pyrite.
“Shiny rocks.”
“Shiny—do you know what those are? How did you find them? Did you take them from—”
Numbtongue shook his head as she glanced up at him, suddenly worried.
“They’re not hard to get. I—another Goblin used to find them all the time. Mining.”
“You can find these? Mining?”
“Sure. Here. This one makes a good potion, right?”
Numbtongue found a glowing red stone, with pink-red fire. Octavia’s eyes nearly popped back out of her head. She reached for it with a trembling hand, and then stopped.
“But—but—what do you want in return? Money? Gold? I can’t offer you nearly what this is—”
She trailed off, staring at it. And for a second, Numbtongue saw her eyes flicker to him, calculating, assessing. Octavia opened her mouth, reaching for the stone—and then let her hand go limp.
“I can’t pay you what this is worth. But if I could offer you anything in trade? Anything?”
She looked at him hopefully. Numbtongue considered it. He smacked his lips together thoughtfully and nodded.
“Mm. Potions.”
“How many?”
The Hobgoblin thought. The [Alchemist] was tense.
“Two of those?”
He pointed to the bottled healing potions. Octavia stared. Numbtongue frowned.
“Four?”
He waited.
“…Eight?”
The [Alchemist] shook her head.
“You don’t know how valuable these stones are, do you? And my potions are crap compared to—it’s not fair. You know that. You do know that, right?”
She looked up. And Numbtongue’s smile was knowing. He nodded, shrugging casually. A Goblin’s shrug.
“Sure I do. But I want potions. So. Show me how to make them. And make good ones. From these.”
He tapped the mana stone.
“Ones that explode or do good things. Like invisibility. Those are good potions. And give some to me.”
“But the cost—”
“I don’t use shiny rocks. I just throw them at adventurers. To play fetch.”
Numbtongue laughed. Octavia didn’t get the joke. He went on.
“Only other thing is—I eat stones.”
“Mana stones?”
“Yup. Other Goblin did that too. Tasted good too. But sharp. Potions are better. Probably. I tasted good potion once. Invisibility. So you make them. I drink them. Good deal, right?”
Numbtongue smacked his lips, remembering that. Octavia stared at him. Then her eyes welled up with tears.
