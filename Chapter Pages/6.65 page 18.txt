Walt looked around, cursing. But the other adventurers had seen Montressa’s face. Stan pulled a crossbow out.
“If they’re after your team, Ceria—”
“We can’t fight Wistram [Mages]!”
“If they’re attacking us, it’s a damn war!”
Ceria shook her head.
“No one’s fighting. Pisces, Ksmvr, Yvlon, on me. We’re going to meet them.”
“Should I strike first, Captain Ceria?”
The Antinium tilted his head, eying Stan’s crossbow. The [Cryomancer] shook her head.
“No one’s starting anything! But be ready—”
“We’re coming with you. They’re not attacking you again. Liscor’s laid down the law and you haven’t done anything wrong! Whistling Bows, on me!”
Captain Kam snapped. Her team mounted up. Stan waved his hand.
“Boltspitters, to the side.”
“Hold on! This isn’t—”
“Pisces!”
The word split the air. Montressa pointed her staff at him. And the Horns walked forwards. Ceria was on Pisces’ left, Yvlon his right. Ksmvr stood next to Yvlon, his bow in two hands, the Forceshield in his third.
They met in the grass, two hundred feet from the road. In the distance the Bloodfields waited. But Montressa had no eyes for the road or the Bloodfields. She only looked at Pisces.
“Montressa. What do you want?”
The young woman didn’t reply to Ceria’s tight voice. She just stared at Pisces. And her gaze was hateful, angry. And also lost. She looked past Ceria, at the dozens of adventurers standing warily at their backs. Isceil and Beza were eying the small army nervously. But Montressa’s gaze found Pisces’ again. She shook her head slowly.
“Well done. Good job, Pisces. You did it. Again.”
“I did what, exactly?”
Pisces’ hand was on his rapier. He met Isceil’s eyes and fury drew the air taut between them. But Montressa—her hand tightened on her staff.
“You don’t even know? That’s funny. Apparently, the bounty on you is being reduced. And the Academy is abandoning their pursuit of you. I’m going to get orders not to bring you in.”
“What?”
Ceria’s chest untightened suddenly. She smiled, looking at Yvlon. The [Wounded Warrior] didn’t’ take her eyes off Montressa. The [Aegiscaster] shook her head.
“Palt did it. He betrayed me. He—and that [Innkeeper] of yours.”
“Erin did—?”
“I didn’t ask them to. But I am not your enemy, Montressa. I told you, what occurred was an accident. No—my fault. But I never intended it. I am sorry.”
Pisces’ voice was strained. Beza snorted. Montressa’s level voice never changed.
“No you’re not. But it’s funny—I believe you didn’t do anything to Palt or Erin. Because you didn’t have to. Look at you. You’re making undead to help build this road. And you got the Academy to lift its bounty on you. Well done. How do you do it?”
“Do what?”
Montressa didn’t seem to hear Ceria. She looked at Pisces.
“You tricked them. Everyone. All these people—Erin, Palt—everyone. For a little while. And because they trust you—because they help you—they’ll die. You’ll ruin them all. Because that’s what you do. Someday, you’ll show them who you are. And they’ll die, or they’ll suffer. Because of you.”
“That’s not true. Montressa. You’re overreacting.”
“Stop! Montressa! The Academy has ordered you not to pursue Pisces! Everyone, listen to me! Montressa and the [Mages] here have no authority to take Pisces Jealnet in!”
Palt caught up at last with Ulinde. He was clutching at the scorch mark on his chest. The adventurers stared at him. Montressa ignored the Centaur.
“I’m not going to let you go, Pisces.”
“You have no authority here, [Mage]. We’re adventurers and this is an adventuring team. You want to kidnap one of us, you go through all of us.”
