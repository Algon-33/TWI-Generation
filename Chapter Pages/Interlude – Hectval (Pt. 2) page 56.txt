Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 2)
Page 56
Nor…nor were they ready. Crusader 51 hated Starfold and his people. He hated them, simply because of what he knew was coming. The Painted Antinium were not fools. They knew death. They had come here ready to risk their lives.
But they did not know what waited for them. It was one battle. When they struck—Crusader 51 had the same nightmare as the first day.

A howl went up from Hectval’s lines. The Painted Antinium looked up, and a figure emerged past the wavering front line of ordinary Drakes and Gnolls.
A figure in black armor. The Painted Antinium rotated, pivoting to face him, and Theophilus shouted.
“Manus! Sound the alarm! [Archers]!”
“Bring that Gnoll down!”
Starfold pointed, and Painted Antinium [Archers] loosed arrows at the Gnoll. Two curved, and one split into two arrows, but the Gnoll knocked them down.
Was he grinning? Crusader 51 looked up as the two [Clerics] and the [Priest] pivoted. Tersk was roaring.
“Fall back, Zimrah, Theophilus, Jerimy! Olesm, volley on my front lines now! Starfold, hold! Hold!”
The Painted Antinium heard him, and they formed a line. The [Spearmaster] howled as he raced forwards, and four hundred of Manus’ [Soldiers] breached the Alliance’s line like a wave of shadows. They charged straight into the Painted Antinium as the skies opened up.
“Antinium! Break formation! Break formation! They’re in the sky—”
Maksie came screaming down from the heavens. The Scout Leader pointed up—and Crusader 51 saw a flash of light.
[Valmira’s Comet] hit the ground with an explosion. Crusader 51 lowered his sword as he saw more bombardment spells coming out of the sky. The [Spearmaster] charged Starfold, ducked an arrow that would have gone through his brain, and whirled.
“There. Kill that Antinium.”
A Worker with a bow on the cliffs lowered it. He whirled—and four Oldblood Drakes shot out of their hiding place higher up. They landed. The Worker drew a dagger—a Drake ran him through, and the corpse froze and fell off the cliff.
It happened so fast. One second the Gnoll was pointing, then Overstone raised a mace crackling with sparks and two more Soldiers leapt for him. Tersk had told them how to kill high-level enemies. Hold them. Drag them down and keep them from swinging their arms.
Lulv twisted, and his spear flashed up. Overstone fell down with a hole in his head, and the other two Soldiers dropped. The [Spearmaster] raised his spear.
“[Spear Art—]”
“No!”
An Antinium threw themself forwards. One of the [Acolytes]. Crusader 51 lifted his sword, and Squad 5 charged forwards, breaking out of line.
Lulv grinned. He ran the Worker through and then pointed.
“Target down. Now!”
A [Mage] ran past him as the Painted Antinium, stunned, fought with Manus’ [Soldiers]…and lost. A crackling bolt of [Chain Lightning] flashed down as Commander Olesm pointed at the sky. It struck their back lines. Another struck Battalion 4.
“Wyverns! Kill those [Mages]! Kill those—”
The [Mage] pointed down at the fallen Worker.
“[Acid Orb].”
A glowing orb engulfed the remains. Just in case. The [Spearmaster] whirled. Tersk was bellowing.
“Move formations apart! Battalion 1, split by squad! Battalion—”
He raised his shield as Lulv tossed a javelin, which exploded. One of Tersk’s amulets flashed. Five more arrows swerved out of the way. He blocked a second javelin, and his enchanted shield dented.
