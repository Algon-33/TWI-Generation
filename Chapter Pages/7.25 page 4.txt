She whispered. The Bloodfeast Raiders looked at her, confused. Then Ryoka turned and ran. Ran as fast as she could. She heard them laughing behind her. And she feared them, feared death because they carried it with them. But she couldn’t help but think that thought over and over as she ran, her lungs bursting, moving too slowly as she put every bit of power into each step.
How terribly small.

She was about twenty minutes from Celum by carriage. But that was as the carriage moved in the downpour and it began to lessen even as Ryoka ran.
The wind howled at her back. Giving her fear wings. But her feet were just feet. She couldn’t fly, and each second passing was another one closer to death.
The roads were empty at first. The City Runner ran, sprinting fast as she could, terrified she’d slip. Then she saw the first caravan on the road.
A [Merchant] was headed north. He and his team of [Guards] saw the City Runner in the lessening rain and the mercenaries sighed in relief as the storm clouds began to part. They paid little attention to the City Runner, save to note how fast she was going. Some priority delivery?
They heard her shout as she spotted them.
“Turn around! Get back to Celum! [Raiders]! Bloodfeast Raiders!”
The words tore out of Ryoka’s mouth. The [Merchant] poked his head out of the wagon.
“What?”
The [Head Guard] blinked. He saw the City Runner running at them. A long-legged young woman. Face pale behind her darker skin.
“What? [Raiders]?”
He and his escort checked their weapons. But then the last part of her words struck him. The [Guard] heard Ryoka’s terrified voice.
“Bloodfeast Raiders are behind me! Run! Run!”
The [Guards] froze. The [Merchant] turned pale.
“Not the—they struck six hundred miles north of here last time! It’s not—are you sure? Hello?”
He bellowed at the young woman. She just ran past him. There was a [Farmer] taking her wares to market. Not Wailant; the [Pirate]-[Farmer]’s absence had ironically enriched every other [Farmer] selling to Celum. The female [Farmer] heard Ryoka shouting.
She too froze. But Ryoka was running past her, ignoring the questions. She screamed it at a group of [Riders].
“Bloodfeast Raiders! Run!”
“Guard—take us around. Even if it’s normal [Raiders]—at all speed.”
The [Merchant] seized the reins, yanked the startled donkeys around. The [Guards] saw the caravan turning. They glanced up the road. Then—they saw the City Runner running for Celum.
It couldn’t be real. The Bloodfeast Raiders were a myth. Like the Goblin Lord. Or—not a myth, but a reality that didn’t happen to normal people. Not to them. For a moment, the people basked in that luxury of disbelief.
Then the panic set in. The [Farmer] unhitched her horses from her wagon. She slashed the leads—then leapt on the back of a horse. She didn’t turn her wagon. She booted the startled draft horse and raced off the road. Abandoning her wagon. The other horse, startled, followed her.
The [Riders] turned and began to race after the City Runner. The [Merchant] paled.
“—Dump the cargo! Dump the cargo! Everything but the valuables! Hurry!”
He screamed at his assistants and workers. They stared at him, and then at the people fleeing back towards Celum. The City Runnner was still running, screaming the alarm.
Bloodfeast. Supplies began falling out of the caravan as they were shoved out. But then—one of the [Guards] swore.
The escort’s leader, the [Head Guard]. He had made up his mind. The Runner could be wrong. But if she was right?
“Ride! Towards Celum!”
