“We just go sightseeing. Around. I’m learning a bit of magic, but—it’s hard, you know? We’re all low-level because it takes years to get to Level 20! And—we’re from earth. What can we do? I don’t know how to use a sword or a bow. I’m practicing.”
Ryoka looked at Rose. She paused.
“I’m studying to be a [Mage]. I’m Level 11. I think I really have a knack!”
“You’re Level 11? Do you have any other classes?”
“No. What’s your class?”
“I don’t have one.”
The others stared. Even Bekia and Nerrissa.
“Why not? Have you seen what Skills can do? Show them your [Power Strike], Joseph!”
“Not inside.”
Bekia barked. The Gnoll restored order as Ryoka had to take a step back. Thankfully, Bekia drew her back, forcing the others to sit and have some tea. Rose clearly wanted to talk to her, as did the others, but Ryoka needed one second.
“They have a stipend. And we clean up for them. From time to time.”
The Gnoll murmured to Ryoka. The City Runner stared at her.
“You’re babying them. That’s why they’re like—”
She waved a hand at them. One, Troy, went up to grab his laptop to synch Ryoka’s iPhone. Nerrissa followed him, exasperated. Bekia shrugged.
“Lady Reinhart did let them try to live alone. They were rather poor at it, no? Hold on—”
As Troy left, someone else entered the parlor. The eighth member of the group. Ryoka saw dark skin, downcast eyes. Imani paused when she saw Ryoka. Bekia turned to her.
“Imani, are you well? You look much rested, yes?”
The Gnoll’s voice was much gentler than it was with the others. She led Imani forwards, offering her a cup of tea. The young woman went to Ryoka instead.
“Are you…?”
Her eyes were too wide. She looked sleep-deprived, too. Ryoka looked at her and remembered something else Erin had said. Something from a phone call. A chat room.
“My name is Ryoka Griffin. Who are you?”
“I’m Imani. I’m—you’re from Earth?”
Imani looked Ryoka up and down, desperately. Ryoka smiled.
“That’s right. I’m just like you. I work as a City Runner.”
“You go outside?”
Imani’s eyes widened in horror. Ryoka nodded. The young woman stared at Bekia.
“But—”
“Imani ran into monsters when she first came here.”
The Gnoll murmured quietly. Ryoka looked past Imani at the impatient others. Rose was keeping them back. She was looking at Imani. Ryoka turned to the girl.
“What sort of monsters?”
“Tunnel Crawlers. They—we appeared right next to them. Lots of us. We ran. And we got a call—but no one helped us.”
Imani’s voice trembled. Ryoka’s stomach clenched.
“Tunnel Crawlers? Oh. Crelers. How’d you…?”
“We got onto the rocks. The big ones. They couldn’t climb the rocks. And the little ones—we kept throwing them off. Or trying to. I was…I was the only one that made it.”
The young woman’s voice broke. Bekia took her shoulder reassuringly. Ryoka didn’t know what to say.
“I’m so sorry. I’ve only ever seen Crelers once. And I ran and reported that nest—I’m sorry.”
She hesitated, and then touched Imani’s shoulder. The young woman flinched. But then she looked up at Ryoka.
“Are you here to stay too?”
Ryoka looked past her. Joseph, Rose, Troy, Galina, who was arguing with the others about spilling tea on the expensive couches—Ryoka bit her tongue. Joseph waved at her.
“Yeah, are you going to stay, Ryoka? We could use more company!”
You’re all pathetic.
That was what Ryoka wanted to say. But she didn’t. She really, really wanted to shout it at them. Maybe drop kick Joseph or all of them except Imani. But she didn’t. For one big reason: it wasn’t really their fault.
