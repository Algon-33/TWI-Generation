“Yes. And that solves your issue of location, girl. But the problem remains: that is not enough. Not for the fae. Your [Emperor] has one flaw. Two, really. One is that he is alone. The second? He does not own the land. Not in the right way.”
The City Runner’s heart sank.
“But he’s an [Emperor]. Do you mean he’s not really one?”
“No, no. I’m sure he has the class.”
The Dragon waved that off. He tried to explain. And it was simple, really.
“Your [Emperor] is new to Izril. Even if he were to live here for a thousand years, he would be new to the fae. Because his forefathers did not live and die here. His family’s bones do not lie in Izril’s soil. That is claim. True, the Humans invaded Izril millennia ago. But the nobles, like Magnolia Reinhart herself, have a claim the fae respect. Death and life for generations.”
“Oh.”
That was fae logic. Ryoka clenched her fists and punched the grass. Teriarch frowned.
“It helps. Mistake me not. An [Emperor] is attractive. But he has only one [Lady] in his court? Yes, and he summoned the fae once?”
“More like he asked for a favor.”
Laken had once summoned the fae to meet the other nobles. But that made the Dragon smile.
“Of course they came. And that is your answer! Ryoka Griffin! That is your answer. And a mirror of what I intended. The fae came because the other nobles were present. Because the [Emperor] set a stage worthy of their arrival. If such a gathering is made twice, they will come again.”
He stood up, excited now. Ryoka stood up as well, heart beating.
“You mean…”
“Your friend arranged a party for the fae. That is once. This [Emperor]? Twice. That means this will be the third celebration ever thrown. At least in recent memory. Fae love such significance in numbers. You have fate on your side, Ryoka Griffin. On the Summer Solstice—you must convince this [Emperor] to throw the kind of ball the world has never seen. With no iron. With mead and food aplenty! With a clear invitation to the fae in all their little rules and formalities.”
Teriarch pointed at Ryoka. She followed him as he walked.
“Yes, yes. That is exactly what I had planned. If you are lucky, you will attract the entire Summer Court. If you have gifts? Well-reasoned words? You will be able to attract your friend. She may even be allowed to attend.”
“Really?”
“The Faerie King is not cruel.”
Teriarch smiled at Ryoka. Her heart felt like it was going to explode.
“Tell me, then. Everything I need. I’ll do it. I have money. I can ask Laken—”
“Hold. There is one problem, Ryoka Griffin. And it is a severe one.”
Ryoka froze. Teriarch raised his head. And suddenly, he was wary. The Dragon looked at her.
“Your truest problem is this: the [Emperor], this Godart, is not enough of a presence. As I said, he is no true [Emperor] as the fae reckon it, no lord of the land who can call them. To honor the fae, you must have more of Izril’s nobility present. Those who live and die here.”
The City Runner’s stomach clenched.
“Laken can—ask them? Invite them.”
“No doubt that would help. Try to get at least a hundred.”
“A hundred?”
Suddenly, Ryoka felt her legs grow weak. The Dragon looked at her.
“Not only that. You must have at least…hrm. Three. An auspicious number. Three…of the greatest nobles of this continent. All of whom must supplicate the fae. Intentionally.”
“I can’t do that! How am I supposed to do that?”
Ryoka was on the ground. She shouted up at Teriarch. He looked at her, gravely.
