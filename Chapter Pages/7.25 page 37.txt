“Put him in a bed, Lyonette. I’ll go to sleep after…another hour. I just have to keep helping. I have to.”
The [Princess] didn’t object. She just nodded. And gently took Timbor’s arm and led him away.
And Erin Solstice walked back into Celum. Feeling helpless, but doing her best. Which was what you had to do.
She stopped when she heard the laughter. It was unfamiliar, amid the crushing silence. No one had laughed—except with hysterical relief.
Even the Earthers had been silent, not flippant, just helping load supplies. Imani herself had been struck by the desolation. But they had pulled their weight. For once.
Erin was too tired to think about them. She followed the sound of the laughter. It was…strange.
Young voices. Erin turned the corner, and felt a breeze. She saw a street, not broken by magic. And a bunch of children.
They were flying about, pushed by the wind. Little bits of cloth carried them around. Some of them looked—uncertain. Shocked. But the wind was catching playfully at their clothes. And they were flying.
A girl went skidding across the ground. And for a moment, she could forget about the death and destruction. In that way—she was more resilient than adults. She started giggling as the wind tugged her up. The little parachute made her scream in delight.
Some of the adults watching flinched at the sound. But the other children laughed. And a boy who had been sobbing forgot his woes for a moment.
Was that cruelty? No—kindness. Forgetting was a kindness. Distraction was necessary. It did not heal their wounds or bring back the dead.
But it was all one person could do. Not Erin. The [Innkeeper] stared at the weather phenomenon in the street. Then she heard a voice.
“Wind Runner! Wind Runner! I want to fly!”
“Really? Then—up you go. Hold on tight.”
Carefully, a young woman tossed a child into the air. And the wind made her hover and flail, laughing, as she slowly fell to earth. Erin Solstice froze.
She knew that voice. Disbelieving, Erin stared ahead. She saw dark skin, black hair. Torn, sooty clothing. An awkward smile.
“Impossible.”
Erin leaned against a wall. Fals had seen her run. The [Guards] had too. It couldn’t be.
She always ran away. That was her nature. City Runner. She had told Erin once that she ran from her problems. Like so many times. But for once—
She had come back.
Ryoka Griffin was tired from working through the night. It was all she could do to keep on her feet. But the wind blew. And the children—like those in Reizmelt, laughed.
A small thing. But she had come back. And that was the hardest thing to do. Harder than running away.
At the same time—so much easier than running away. This was right. Even if it wasn’t her fault. She had to be here. Ryoka gently bent over. A boy was sobbing.
“Hey. It’ll be okay. It’s going to be okay. Alright?”
She picked him up. Held him, awkwardly as she hugged him. But that was enough. He clung to her, and after a moment, his sister came by.
“Thank you, Miss.”
Ryoka handed the boy to her. She tried to smile. And as she looked around—she saw someone standing in the middle of the street, looking at her.
The wind faltered. Ryoka Griffin froze. Erin Solstice looked at her.
“Ryoka?”
The City Runner jerked. She looked around. Then—she squatted down. She tried to hide behind one of the toddlers tying a parachute around his waist. Then gave up. Ryoka Griffin stood.
“…Hey. Erin.”
The two looked at each other. Erin slowly walked forwards. Ryoka hesitated. Then approached. They were silent for a moment. Then the City Runner spoke.
“Sorry.”
“For what?”
