That was when the [Dangersenses] began to go off. A [Sergeant], a fellow officer, met the eyes of the [Sergeant] standing across from him.
“Captain. That’s…a high-level [Soldier].”
The [Captain] felt it too. One second he was clutching at a burning face, enraged beyond belief, running down the pests who were attacking his people.
The next? The air felt hot. He felt as if he were standing on the battlefield, facing down an army.
“Who the fuck is that?”
He looked around. The [Soldiers] had no clue. But now they were at a dead stop. Threats aside…they did not want to advance.
The civilians and Watch had slowed their mad flight. They turned back to look at the lone [Spearmaster] holding down an entire company of Cellidel.
“The 2nd Spears will advance on the enemy!”
The [Captain] roared. He activated a Skill. [Reinforce Will]. The [Soldiers]’ weapons swung up. Relc cursed. He stared at the [Captain].
“Alright, you Creler-brained idiot. Do you want a war?”
The [Spearmaster]’s posture lowered further. He was crouched along his spear, but no longer in a set stance. Like a springer, his weight shifted from his back foot to the front.
A hunting posture. Like an animal. His head lowered further. Beneath his helm, two bright yellow orbs stared at the [Soldiers].
Their blood chilled. That was…not the look a person gave them. It was like an animal staring at them. Or the kind of veterans of so many battles that these low-level [Soldiers] couldn’t even dream of how many blood-soaked grounds you had to see to look like that.
Then Relc activated his Skill. The Skill of battlefields. It had been a long, long time since he had used it. Not when Skinner attacked. Not when monsters threatened.
A Skill for the battlefield.
“[Officer Headhunter Mode].”
The [Captain] didn’t hear the voice. Yet he saw the air around Relc change. It turned…darker. He squinted, incredulous.
“What is that? What is…?”
The [Sergeant] glanced at his superior. Then he saw it too, and recoiled.
The street was the same. The Drake was the same in height, build. But what did they see lying there?
Bodies. Was that blood on his armor? The [Sergeant] and [Captain] saw a hand grasping out. A staring face.
A dead Drake, wearing epaulets and the crest of a city they didn’t know. Yet perfect in every detail. Someone who had once been; not a figment of their imagination. He stared at them through a hole in his throat.
Another Gnoll lay, her chest bloodied by three stab wounds that had gotten through her armor.
Officers, like them.
The [Spearmaster] stood with the dead officers lying around him. Crouched. The air smelled like blood.
The [Captain]’s eyes were wide. He saw his death on the tip of that spear. Now he knew the name. Now he remembered.
Did you hear there’s a Senior Guardsman in Cellidel? They say he was a [Soldier] once. Some kind of a stupid name. What was it, again? Oh, yes—
The Gecko of Liscor. Relc Grasstongue. The veteran who had slain countless officers in battle.
Laugh. Go ahead, laugh. What a funny name. What a…
The air stank like carrion. The [Captain] saw something lying there. He saw a body, reaching out, eyes blank, flesh rotting through the hole through the back of the head and mouth.
He looked himself in the eyes.
The [Soldiers] got only a fraction of Relc’s Skill. It was not for them. It was not an aura, but a directed attack. A buff, a boon to help Relc accomplish a deadly goal.
They smelled something. Looked back, saw the Captain’s dead white face under his scales. A [Soldier] stared down at the wet ground incredulously. The [Captain] choked on his words.
