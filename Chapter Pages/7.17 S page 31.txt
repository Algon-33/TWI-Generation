He dodged the swipe from the claws. Onieva stared past him. And Mirn—was concerned. This was bad, even for her. Chaldion and Saliss seldom spoke because this happened. And Chaldion and Onieva?
Never.
“Tell me about Zel Shivertail, Onieva. He was one of us?”
“Turnscale. Yeah. I met him a few times. Never in secret. I bet you he could never have come here.”
“I wish I could have met him. I bet you I could tell. You’re sure?”
Onieva looked past Mirn.
“Absolutely. You’d know in a heartbeat. I think he found me out.”
“General Shivertail. The Tidebreaker.”
Mirn closed his eyes. The hero of the Drakes. He was dead. But the knowledge mattered. They were not alone. If Zel Shivertail had been one of them, they were not wrong.
“He was one of us, Onieva. That means something.”
“It means Drakes, the cities need heroes, Mirn. It means the old man’s right. And that the world needs Saliss more than Onieva. It means I shouldn’t come back here. And you know what? Part of me agrees. That’s why I’m Saliss. Because I know we need Saliss of Lights. The Antinium. Humans. Monsters. We need him. Not someone who’s a traitor to our species.”
The Drake was resting her head on the bar. Mirn had nothing to say to that. He left her for a moment as someone came over.
“Mirn, Mirn. That Drake is asking if this is our regular gathering spot.”
A Garuda whispered urgently at him. The Drake saw the newcomer circulating the tables. Laughing, smiling. But something—the Drake felt a warning bell go off in his head. He looked at the Garuda.
“That’s not bad, Quet—”
But the Garuda had the same thought as Mirn.
“It’s how he’s asking, Mirn. You know? Like last time.”
His feathers were standing up. Mirn grabbed the Garuda and towed him back. He whispered, urgently.
“Don’t get alarmed. Onieva and I are both here. I’ll deal with it. Tell everyone else not to run for the doors. Stay put.”
The Garuda nodded. Mirn strode over.
“Hey! You! No one asks questions here. You can come back tomorrow. No details, no names. Don’t you know the rules?”
He glared, and saw an unfamiliar face turning towards him. The Drake was young. Fairly handsome. Nice tail. He raised his claws, looking sheepish.
“Sorry, I’m new.”
“No questions.”
Mirn repeated. Nothing was certain. He saw Quet glancing at him and nodded. Keep an eye out. He got a nod and went back to Onieva. She was past depressed and spiraling. Now she was staring at the ceiling. And when one of her eyes moved towards Mirn, he got worried.
“Do you ever feel like burning it all down, Mirn? Sometimes I wonder if I could.”
“Burn…what down, Onieva?”
“Pallass. Sometimes I wonder if I could. Just destroy the city, maybe. I can’t destroy the walls. But the rest of it? If only the people weren’t in the way. Then it would be easy. I could do it. They couldn’t stop me. Not at first. It would be like the Greater Wyvern.”
She stared past Mirn. And he remembered. His friend was a Named-Rank Adventurer. Mirn made his voice cheerful.
“You—wouldn’t do that, though. It’s a shit society. But we need the cities. And we’re still Drakes, aren’t we? You can’t quit being that. You can’t stop being a Drake, right?”
He believed that. But the [Alchemist] just looked past him.
“In a heartbeat. But you know why I’m still me? It’s because I still love that old idiot. Still. And because he’s right. Not about…Onieva. But because Saliss is needed. He has to do terrible things, Mirn. Things I can’t even tell you about. The Antinium don’t stay in their Hives all the time.”
She whispered that and Mirn’s scales tingled. Onieva’s head rolled. She looked at him again, seriously.
