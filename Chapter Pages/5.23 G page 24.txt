Rags nodded. Anger. It was such a strange feeling. She had woken, feeling her tribe torn. She had seen the empty look in the eyes of her Goblins, heard their grief. But anger? It was in Redscar. But three days of fighting had left only embers.
“Anger. Rage. Orders is still orders.”
A pause. Redscar lowered his head.
“True.”
Rags turned her head. Redfang warriors looked at her or stared at their wolves. Some challengingly. Others unashamed. Some regretful. Anger. Fury. She reached in her chest.
“They killed us.”
The Goblins looked at her. Rags looked around. Fewer faces. Fewer wolves. The Redfangs had survived the fighting more than most by virtue of their superior levels and skill. But they had lost numbers too. Rags could see it when she looked around her tribe.
“They poisoned us.”
Like rats. Rags’ grip tightened on her Carn Wolf’s fur and it whined. She let go. She looked at Redscar and then around at the Redfang warriors.
“Who is Chieftain? Who is leader for Redfangs?”
They looked at each other. Redscar called out, his voice loud.
“You, Chieftain!”
Rags nodded. It had to be said.
“Follow orders. Follow my orders.”
She gave them. The Redfang warriors looked confused. Then, as they realized what she wanted, they sat in their saddles. Their eyes burned. Rags pointed. In the distance Humans were pursuing them on horseback. Too few. Too slow.
“Go. Go and show them.”
She pointed west. The Redfang’s heads turned as one. Rags pointed east. They looked. She pointed north and south and shouted.
“They attacked us! They killed us! So show them same! Show them pain! Show them hate. Show them Goblins.”
She kicked her Carn Wolf and rode past the Redfang warriors. They raised their weapons, shouting. The wolves began to howl.
“Burn the villages and towns and fields. No mercy. No Humans spared.”
Redscar’s eyes shone as he pointed. Redfang warriors roared. Rags reached inside her chest. There it was. Something darker than anger, thicker than fury. She reached for it and a black tingling ran through her veins.
“Kill them. Ride. Burn the playthings—”
She broke off, touched a hand to her head. The Redfang warriors waited. Rags looked up. She saw the Humans racing towards them. She saw Erin’s face, plastered on the corpses. And then she saw the dead, lying on the ground in the darkness. She turned and the blackness inside her spoke for her.

“Emperor Laken? General Wiskeria is asking you for an update. She is in pursuit of the Goblins riding wolves.”
My hands are sweaty. I’m shaking. Reeling, rather. Lancrel has fallen. The Goblin took it in less than an hour. It’s fine, though. They can be defeated. Just so long as the army reaches them—I need to send trebuchets. But this force—I follow it with my mind.
“I see them. They’re headed south. They’ve stopped. Wait—wait. What are they—”
Something’s happening. I see the small Goblin raise her hand in my head. The Goblins roar. And then—they move. But not in one direction.
“Oh no.”
The image of the wolves splinters in my mind, the solid mass of Goblins breaking up into groups of ten, of two, riding in every direction. They race across the ground, not one mass, but splitting up, into smaller groups. Smaller and smaller. In every direction.
“No, no. This can’t be happening.”
“Emperor Laken? General Wiskeria is requesting a location. Emperor Laken? Your Majesty?”
I raise my head, sightless, my hands clenched. Nesor’s sweaty face stares back at me. Lady Rie pauses.
“Where are the wolf riders headed? Emperor Laken?”
“Everywhere.”
