This was morning in The Wandering Inn. Everyone watched out of the corner of their eyes as Mrsha went into the kitchen with Erin and Lyonette and came back with another plate of eggs in a moment. She put it on the table in front of Numbtongue. He nodded, smiled, and began to eat. And Mrsha sat with him, wagging her tail as Erin and Lyonette helped Ishkr and the two Gnolls on morning duty pass out the rest of the food.
“Erin! Hey, Erin! Is my thing ready?”
A pale, scaly hand and unfamiliar voice waved at Erin as she passed by Numbtongue’s table. She looked over and recognized Jelaqua. Different body, same grin. Erin blinked.
“Not yet! Give them like, five minutes, Jelaqua?”
“Got it. Hey! All these adventurers in the inn, huh? Feels like a second Adventurer’s Guild!”
The Selphid grinned at the other teams eating around her. Bevussa called over to the Selphid.
“Jelaqua, is your team interested in the Bloodfields mission? I thought you were still going to Invrisil.”
“Yeah, well, the thing is…we’re getting there! A few miles a day. Sometimes more. I’m uh, on vacation. You know. With Maughin?”
Jelaqua grinned a bit nervously. Ceria exchanged glances with her team. Bevussa nodded slowly.
“Right.”
“Now that’s news. Wonder what it’s like in Pallass. A Dullahan and a Selphid? I wish I could hear the gossip.”
Zassil commented under his breath. Issa kicked him.
“Don’t be a lizard. It’s sweet!”
“I’m just saying. Maughin? Master Maughin? And…”
“It takes all kinds, Zassil.”
“Yeah, but how many kinds? And how many bodies? I mean, that’s a nice one. Objectively, right? If it was just that one, awesome, but what if—stop kicking me!”
Jelaqua was talking, oblivious to the side conversation.
“So I’m out. And my uh, team, is sort of on vacation too. At least, they’re either doing that or moving the door. I gotta make it up to them a bit.”
She grinned a bit wanly. Bevussa looked around, although Moore’s absence was conspicuous.
“Right. Where are they today?”
“Seborn and Moore? They’re in Pallass. Moore’s been getting depressed lately. Female company, you know? A lack of it. So Seborn finally got him to…er…”
Jelaqua caught Mrsha’s eye. She and Lyonette were both giving the Selphid expectant looks at the next table. So was Erin. Numbtongue, frowning and listening as he ate breakfast, paused, and then his expression cleared as Pyrite told him the answer.
Jelaqua coughed.
“Well, they’re just going to look.”
“Look at what?”
“Well—hey, Erin! Are those cookies done?”
“Let me check. Uh…yep! One sec! Hey, is there a bag anywhere?”
“I’ve got one! Bag of holding. Right here!”
The Selphid hurried into the kitchen. Ceria saw her coming out, patting a bag. Erin had a smaller platter of the rest of the cookies.
“And I made a double batch! Who wants—”
Half the hands in the inn shot up. Lyonette cleared her throat.
“That’s extra, not breakfast.”
Only three hands went down. Mrsha waved hers eagerly. Pisces, who had hitherto been preoccupied with his cereal and reading a book at the table, flicked a finger. Erin yelped as a cookie tried to float off her plate. Then another.
“Hey! Whoever’s doing that, stop!”
Pisces, Ceria, and Kin all paused guiltily. Erin snatched the floating cookies back and counted.
“There’s enough for all of you! Now, Lyonette, here’s the cookies. You can make them pay. Jelaqua, that good?”
The Selphid was counting her custom-ordered cookies. She patted the bag again, and then looked at Erin. She smiled.
“I think so. Thanks for doing this, Erin. Really.”
