She led them forwards. Inkar, talking with Tkrn, tickling him gently, looked up. Her hands fell away. She stood, uncertainly. Rose gasped. She began running, arms spread wide. Inkar heard her shouting, and her eyes filled with tears.
Rose met Inkar.

The last visitors of the day to the city of Esthelm came through the gates. They were promptly stopped by the [Guards].
“You there. Halt.”
The Guard instructed one of the figures. The person turned, looking surprised, but not saying a word. They gestured at their face as if to say, ‘me, but why me?’
The [Guards] were more vigilant than most cities. They were former [Militia] who’d become regular [Soldiers], [Warriors], [Sentries], [Watchwomen], and so on.
This [Gate Watchwoman], a specialist in fighting at…gates…rolled her eyes.
“Yes, you. Are you serious? Your group. Stop. Hands up.”
The figures halted. The other people entering the city—and they weren’t many—backed away as the [Guards] drew their weapons. They didn’t play games. The [Watchwoman] pointed.
“I’ve never seen—you think you can just walk in? Like that? Are you serious?”
The masked figure in front, with a hood over their head, began to speak. The [Watchwoman] ignored her.
“Mask off! Hood off!”
She looked at her squad, who were ready for anything. Part of the [Gate Guard] was just…incredulous. Who thought someone wearing a face-mask and a hood wasn’t suspicious?
The carved, painted wooden mask was blocking the person’s features, and the rest of the small group. They wore heavy hooded cloaks that disguised everything about them. They were the most suspicious group the [Gate Guard] had ever seen.
The great disguise of Garen Redfang, as it turned out, was not that useful as the legends said. The arrows were nocked, ready to fire. The leader of the trio hesitated.
“Mask off or we fire!”
The [Gate Guard] had already signaled for reinforcements. At this, the leader apparently decided there was no help for it. Slowly, they reached up, removed the mask—
And spoke.
“Hold your fire, Guardswoman. Please.”
The [Watchwoman] saw Bevussa look at her as she tossed her hood back. Issa removed her mask, and so did Kin.
“Is that…the Wings of Pallass?”
One of the [Guards] recognized the three. The [Watchwoman] lowered her crossbow.
“Captain Bevussa? Why are you dressed like that?”
“It’s a long story, Guardswoman…”
Bevussa had no idea, really. All she knew was that Rags’ last ‘request’ was that Bevussa had to wear hood, robes, and mask as they were dropped off a walking distance away from Esthelm. She was as confused as the [Guards], but it was clear she wasn’t a Goblin.
On the other hand, further into the city, a Goblin happily walked into Esthelm, glancing around merrily, nudging his companion every five seconds.
“Look at that.”
“I see it. Stop nudging.”
“Look at that. Chieftain, buy me that.”
He pointed to a window display, tugging her back to point at a handsome cast iron pan. Imagine how many meals he could make on that! Rags punched his leg.
To any amused observer, it seemed like a daughter punching her father in the leg. Well—they appeared vaguely related, and that was enough for silly Humans who hadn’t seen many of their kind. A male half-Elf and a younger, female half-Elf child.
Rags wondered if the illusion on the rings did that because of the pointed ears. She kept checking her reflection, but she hadn’t even needed Bevussa’s distraction.
“Amazing. Am I handsome?”
Calescent stared at himself. Rags snorted.
“For a half-Elf, maybe. Hurry up.”
