The huge Drake stared at her. At the brass ring on her finger. At the young woman’s clothing—casual. Even bright. But he had observed the others, with their strange clothing. Outlandish designs. He had heard their whispers, looking at him. Calling him a ‘bodybuilder’. Also, a ‘narcissist’, but that wasn’t the point.
“Erin Solstice. If you have—no. There is a situation that requires your presence.”
The [Mage] stood up. Erin blinked.
“Uh—is this about this morning? I can put this stuff away. I don’t want to cause Venim trouble.”
“This morning?”
Grimalkin glanced around. He shook his head, distractedly.
“This is a minor inconvenience compared to—the Assembly of Crafts is in uproar, Miss Solstice. You will have to come with me. Now.”
“Uh oh. I didn’t do it! I think!”
Erin began to panic. Grimalkin saw another woman appear behind Erin. Who was this? No, wait, he recognized her.
“What is it, Erin?”
“Nothing, Maviola! I mean—what did I not do, Grimalkin?”
The Drake folded his arms. He spoke one word and saw Erin’s face change.
“Pelt.”
“Oh. That…might be me. What’s happening?”
“He’s leaving.”
Maviola gasped. Her eyes went wide. Erin? Grimalkin saw her half-smile and then cover it. Her face turned into innocent shock.
“Oh wow! I mean—that’s not my fault! But good for him, right? He’s not happy here, anyways.”
She peeked at him. The Drake said nothing, but his eyes narrowed slightly.
“The situation demands your presence. Now, Erin.”
“Fine, I’m coming. Maviola—”
“I’m coming too. This is exactly what I was trying to teach you about, Erin.”
The [Lady] looked excited. Grimalkin sighed but took it in stride. He stepped aside.
“Let’s go. 9th Floor. We may make it in time.”
“Okay. Lyonette! I’m going to Pallass for a bit! It’s not my fault!”
Erin shut the door. The two Human women began walking. Grimalkin followed them. Looking sideways at Erin.
“You don’t seem that remorseful.”
“I didn’t do it. M-mostly.”
She avoided looking at him. Grimalkin thought about the things he could do. The things the [Senators] wanted to do to her involved at least a public quartering. But they needed her. Dead gods, how would he convince even Chaldion of his hypothesis?
But it was true. Grimalkin was not an idiot. He exercised his mind like every other body part. He had noticed Erin’s inconsistencies. And over time, methodically come to the one logical explanation. He tried not to stare at her back, tried to make his silence feel like anger rather than—shock. Awe.
“How much trouble am I in, Grimalkin? Um…asking for a friend.”
He didn’t reply. The [Sinew Magus] followed Erin. Staring at her back. Yes. There was only one thing she could be. He had considered everything.
That she was the daughter of a Wall Lord of Salazsar. That she was a [Princess]. An adventurer. A Drathian—the disciple of Niers Astoragon?
A member of the King of Destruction’s court? A child of Rhir? Related to one of the Archmages—no—a descendant of a real [Archmage]? Nothing had been off the table.
But the truth was that there was no trace of Erin. Nor did she know enough about…anything. She knew too much, and too little. She had taught him about protein shakes. But she wouldn’t explain what a ‘protein’ was. He had no doubt she knew.
So—the Drake would learn. For now, he contained his awe. He worked on validating his theory. He looked at the back of the…time traveller. The girl from another era. It only made sense. The question he had to ask was simply: before, or after now?
It would make all the difference.
