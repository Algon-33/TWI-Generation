“Lad! Falene’s in trouble!”
He raised his axe to throw, looked at the [Mages], then cursed and lowered it. Ylawes ran forwards and shouted.
“[Shield of Valor]!”
A giant, glimmering shield took over Falene’s barrier, and she staggered back. The last Earthers exited the room. Elena and George—but the [Mages] were advancing, and the steel Golem walked towards Dawil, shielding its face as he turned with the axe raised.
“Cut them off! They’re all running! Tell the Archmage—”
The Silver Swords saw the [Mages] were shouting at each other. Ylawes looked over his shoulder and heard shouting from down the corridor.
More [Mages]. Feor had prepared multiple groups. The [Knight] cursed and backed up.
“Falene—distract them! We have to run!”
“The others—”
Elena didn’t get a chance to finish the sentence. Falene raised her hands and spoke.
“[Flashbang]. [Noxious Fumes]. [Gust of Air]. [Ink Spray]. [Oiled Floor].”
“Oh, come on—”
One of the [Mages] got a chance to complain before they were deafened, then covered with stink and ink. Some of the smarter ones simply advanced, shimmering barriers protecting them—then slipped on the oiled floor. A few kept going, chasing after the Silver Swords and the Earthers with them.
“You stole that spell from Ryoka!”
Dawil panted as Falene ran. She didn’t dignify that with a response. Wistram [Mages] didn’t steal. They innovated. Ryoka’s spell just happened to be a bang rather than shriek and slightly brighter.

Other Earther groups weren’t so lucky. Saif lifted his airsoft gun and fired a round of bullets. They bounced off a magical shield as a [Mage] raised his brows.
“I don’t see what the problem is. How did you all manage to lose to this thing in the testing chambers?”
“If they’re magic-piercing bullets it’s a cause for concern. Put down the gun, Saif. You all, stop moving.”
A Centaur waved his wand at the group of eight. Saif turned.
“Go, I’ll hold them—”
“[Stun Arrows].”
A few blue arrows flashed from the Centaur’s wand and the Human man’s and hit Saif in the chest. He went over, and the man chuckled.
“Alright, enough. We have you. You won’t be punished much—but enough’s enough.”
“You thugs! You—you tyrants! You jack-booted bastards!”
Caroline shouted at them. The Centaur eyed his hooves.
“I assume that’s an Earth-insult. Listen, young woman. We’ve been very kind and patient, but enough is—argh.”
“That’s right. Wait, what did you say, Clempt?”
The [Mage] turned just in time to see a giant, shadowy hand pick him up and drag him screaming into a similarly giant, shadowy void. His scream was cut off, and the Earthers stared in horror as a wall of shadows roiled in place.
Then, after a second, it spat out both [Mages], unconscious, and morphed into a familiar [Mage] wearing all-black and a dark veil.
“This way. The ship is waiting.”
One of Depth Mage Doroumata’s daughters beckoned the students. They hesitated, and she stepped forwards.
“We are prepared to take you away from Wistram. Come with me. Hurry. The [Mages]—”
She spun, and a ward of darkness flashed around her, catching two dozen arrows of light. Not the glowing orb someone rolled towards her feet, which exploded and tossed her into a wall.
The [Depth Mage] crumpled as someone chuckled.
“I knew it. Ullsinoi to Galei? We’ve got a breakout. Tell Naili and Viltach we’re in trouble.”
A grinning figure stopped, inspecting the downed [Depth Mage] as she tried to struggle up. She raised a wand, but he blasted it out of her hand.
“[Mages]. Even the Drowned Ones never expect alchemy. Hands up, all of you. No—on second thought, [Sleep Mist].”
