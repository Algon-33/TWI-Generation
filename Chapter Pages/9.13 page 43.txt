The [Necromancer] froze, and Az’kerash cut off as a squad of Humans with spears surrounded him.
“I’m—just walking around at night!”
He hid the bag of holding behind him as an old, familiar panic crept up. Oh, dead gods! Why hadn’t he gone invisible? Idiot! You idiot—
He was about to run and deal with the consequences later when something unprecedented happened. One of the [Soldiers] saw Pisces and called out.
“Wait! Wait, it’s Adventurer Pisces! The Horns!”
“Oh. Sorry, Adventurer Pisces! Of course, he’s a [Necromancer]—”
The shining lantern light dimmed, and a somewhat embarrassed [Sergeant] saluted.
“Just checking that no scavengers or [Rogues] are stealing the monster parts, sir! We forgot a [Necromancer] was about. Uh—taking bones? Bodies?”
“Just—just bones.”
Az’kerash was silent as Pisces felt as flustered as could be. Stealing from graveyards or battlefields was a very [Necromancer] thing to do, and it earned them a terrible reputation, but the awkward soldiers just nodded.
“For that Frostmarrow Behemoth. I should imagine you need more. We actually have a pile of bones from the harvesting, sir. Hundreds. We could direct you to them?”
“Really?”
“What.”
Az’kerash was as stunned as Pisces. The [Necromancer] actually found himself walking with a squad who were too keen to offer him the largely useless bones.
“Some [Alchemists] want them, and the dogs’re slavering over them, but bones aren’t good for much, sir. And if it’s between them and you—help yourself. I apologize if we startled you.”
“Er—not at all, good [Sergeant]. I quite understand.”
Pisces felt off-kilter, and the [Sergeant] smiled, then he coughed.
“Speaking of which, if those were your undead, we apologize for destroying them. Just when we see any zombies rising, goats or Gargoyles…”
The adventurer was rapidly warming to the [Soldiers] of Vaunt. Not only was the [Lieutenant] a brave fellow, they were quite decent folk. So he was only too keen to smile around.
“Oh, not at all. Those would be natural undead. Direct them to me if they are dangerous, by all means. I would put them down as quickly as you.”
The [Sergeant] nodded, clearly relieved.
“As we thought, sir. But those Gargoyle zombies were rising fast. And some were even coming out of the bone pile. We almost burned the lot.”
“That is quick. Then again—it was a bloody battlefield.”
Pisces frowned, but as they reached the bone-pile he’d been promised, the [Sergeant] cursed.
“Dead gods damnit! There’s another one! Spears up!”
Pisces caught sight of a skeletal Gargoyle, still glistening with bits of flesh, stomping away from the pile of bones. A few [Soldiers] were racing away, calling for backup, but the undead skeleton didn’t pay attention to them. A glowing red flame in both sockets, it was walking towards the distant hilltop and forest. And Pisces…froze.
“If you want to do something, Adventurer, sir, now would be a great time! Not that we can’t handle one, but they are big.”
Indeed, the Gargoyle was still nine feet tall even without flesh, and it had thick bones. It was a powerful minion for even Pisces; if he summoned skeleton Gargoyles instead of regular humanoid skeletons, he’d have a powerful fighting force.
And it would be just the thing for a low-level [Necromancer]. Which was why Pisces stared at the animated Gargoyle skeleton, and his eyes slowly narrowed.
That wasn’t a natural animation at all. Normal skeletons didn’t rise this fast, not on a patrolled battlefield. Even if they did, they’d be attacking the wary soldiers at once.
“Just how many skeletons did you see rising, [Sergeant]?”
