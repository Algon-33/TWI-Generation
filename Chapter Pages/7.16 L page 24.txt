The [Princess] paused. She knew what those were.
“…Don’t eat those, Pawn. I’m sure the Antinium can digest them. Bird seems to. But not you.”
“Why not me?”
The [Priest] looked puzzled. Lyonette leaned over and whispered to him..
“Because, I’m not kissing you if you eat maggots.”
“Oh. Should I stop?”
The young woman was opening and shutting her mouth. She felt good, after meeting with her friends, sitting with Pawn. Erin was laughing, saying hi to Belgrade as they played chess.
“So Chesacre and Thaina are female? They told you? That’s so…weird.”
Her brows contorted. Belgrade shrugged.
“They say they are.”
“Yeah, but—that’s almost like—hold on. From my home…um…”
Erin hesitated. She vaguely knew something about this, but she didn’t at the same time. She opened and closed her mouth; she was still sleep-deprived too. Another night’s sleep would do her good.
And then the door opened. And Klbkch entered the inn.
On a day like today. Good little kids, good Antinium should not be here. At first, Klbkch didn’t even see them. Belgrade squeaked and disappeared, literally shooting out of his chair and into the kitchen. Erin turned to see what was wrong—
“Erin. I have been delayed. But I have come to speak. I would like to speak to you n—”
Klbkch was striding towards her. He walked past Pawn, Anand, the other Painted Antinium, who had frozen at their table. Along with Lyonette. For a moment, it was like one of those cartoons where the person kept walking until they realized the obvious and stopped.
Or a horror movie with the same premise. And then Klbkch halted, mid-step. Mid-word. He turned his head.
And he looked straight at Pawn.
“You.”
None of the Antinium moved. Klbkch was still. He did not move.
He was staring at Pawn.
Anand quivered. He shook, as he stood with the other Antinium. Pawn had gone still. The [Priest] had locked gazes with Klbkch.
“Revalantor Klbkch. We were—Miss Solstice invited us—it was just for…”
Anand’s voice quavered. Erin looked at them. And she realized—a beat behind the others.
The Antinium were not supposed to be here. Klbkch’s restriction on travelling outside the Hive was still in place. Erin had heard about it. But she had assumed…
They had lied. They were here without Klbkch’s awareness. Dissent in the Hive.
Rebellion. Klbkch made no sound. He was just looking. Around the room. He saw Belgrade poking his head out of the kitchen. The Painted Antinium at their tables. Chesacre and Thaina, sitting together.
And he understood. And it was Klbkch. The Senior Guardsman. The one who had saved Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked at him. One of her oldest of friends. Her savior.
The kind Ant. And she couldn’t find him. The Slayer looked. The Revalantor saw.
Because it was him, he did not ask questions. He did not need to. He did not posture. He did not pretend. He did not say something silly, funny, like ‘is it war?’ He did not need to.
He was the oldest of souls. From beneath the hell of Rhir.
True Antinium.
Alone.
The Centenium moved. His right hand lowered.
He drew his sword. The silvery blade turned, and flashed in the light as he held it out, by his side. Klbkch walked forwards.
“Klbkch?”
Erin saw him walking forwards slowly. And her [Dangersense] was making a sound. It sounded like—death.
She stood up. The Antinium were frozen. All but for Pawn.
He stood up too. Lyonette looked at the Worker. The [Priest] put out one of his hands. He walked around the table.
Klbkch raised his sword with two hands. Walking past the frozen crowds.
