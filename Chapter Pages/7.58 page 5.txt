“Fine. I need to get to Invrisil. Meet me at the Player’s Retreat then.”
“Thank you, Delanay. I’ll repay…”
“Don’t thank me. I think you’re mad. But I also—”
Delanay grimaced. He didn’t finish the sentence, but left the inn. Ryoka exhaled. She looked around. Now, just—just a letter. No—
Fierre stood behind her. Ryoka froze. She backed up—and Fierre grabbed her arm. The Vampire was gentle—but her hand was a vice.
“Ryoka. What are you doing?”
Salamani was there too. The Mage Runner looked at Ryoka. And both of them saw what was obvious.
“Nothing, Fierre. I mean—listen. I have to—”
“What, die?”
The Vampire’s grip tightened on Ryoka’s arm. She wanted to drag Ryoka back, but Salamani stopped her.
“This is not a good idea, Ryoka. Give it up.”
“Salamani.”
She looked at him. The Mage Runner, normally smiling, was serious. His two serpentine eyes locked on hers.
“You can’t do this.”
“I have…a secret card.”
“Does it make you arrow proof? Can it block lightning?”
“Maybe? If I get a head start…”
Fierre looked sharply at Ryoka. The City Runner’s pulse was racing through her arm. Fierre could feel the warm blood. But now was not the time. She bared her teeth.
“This is madness, Ryoka!”
“No. It’s the right thing to do!”
The City Runner snapped. She looked at Fierre and the Vampire recoiled at the intensity in the gaze. This time—Ryoka looked at Salamani and Fierre.
“I have a chance. All I need to do is get in and out without being spotted. Give me an hour’s head start and they won’t stop me.”
“Troll shit.”
Salamani cursed. There was real heat in his eyes. Ryoka and Fierre started as he pointed at the scrying mirror.
“You can’t beat that, Ryoka!”
“I can if they don’t know I’m coming. I need to get in secretly and out. Then—then they won’t be able to scry me.”
“What about combing the entire continent for you?”
The Courier was furious. He was prepared to bind Ryoka to a chair and let Fierre stand guard—that was their actual plan, but Ryoka suddenly went cool. She looked at him, and there was a strange confidence in her eyes.
“They’ll never find me. And if I get my head start—they won’t catch me.”
The Courier blinked at her. Fierre’s eyes widened.
“They could catch Salamani—”
“Maybe. But I don’t think anyone will expect what I’m trying. It’s the wind, Fierre. Salamani. The wind…”
Ryoka shifted. The thing in her bag of holding that she’d had made in Reizmelt felt like it was burning. She’d thought she’d use it at Valeterisa’s mansion, but it wouldn’t have been that useful. Here? Now?
This was when it was needed. Ryoka told her friends what it was. They stared at her. Fierre stirred.
“That’s impossible. It’s not enchanted?”
“It doesn’t need to be.”
“You’re mad. It’ll never work!”
“I know it will. I’ve seen it work, Fierre.”
The broker opened and closed her mouth. Ryoka wasn’t lying. She had seen it. On Earth. Salamani rubbed at his eyes.
“It—they could easily spot you. But there’s a chance.”
“Salamani!”
Fierre rounded on him. The Mage Runner looked at her.
“I’m being honest. I wouldn’t expect that. Say Ryoka gets her hour and the [Assassins] don’t realize she’s got the cure. We—we make a [Doppelganger], for instance. I can do illusions. It could work. I’m still only giving her four in ten, even if everything worked perfectly.”
“But there’s a shot. I could eclipse your speed, Salamani. Please. I have to try. If it doesn’t go to plan—I’ll call it off. But let me try.”
Ryoka argued with her friends. She didn’t know what she said, exactly. Only that she convinced them.
