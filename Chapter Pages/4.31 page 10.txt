“Not the city. We’re staying. We might go—we don’t know. We don’t know if we’ll continue trying to enter the dungeon or…anything. But we can’t stay here.”
Revi said it as she looked around the room. Erin looked too. The blood was gone, but she could still see the spot where Ulrien had died. Halrac glanced at it and then away.
“That Ryoka Griffin still won’t tell us who Regrika Blackpaw really works for?”
“No. She wouldn’t tell me. I think she might tell Zel.”
“Fine. I’ll find out either way.”
The [Scout] turned. Erin longed to say something. She hesitated.
“I’m sorry.”
Halrac’s shoulders hunched. Typhenous looked at him and Erin and opened his mouth, and then shook his head. Only Revi stayed as the two began to walk towards the door.
“For what?”
“I’m sorry?”
The Stitch-Girl stared at Erin, a mix of hostility and grief in her eyes.
“You’re sorry? Because Ulrien’s dead? So what? It’s not going to help. Ulrien knew what he was suggesting when he offered to help you against a Named Adventurer. It was his choice. He died. And now our group has no leader.”
Erin stared at her. Revi looked away and wiped her eyes. She still hadn’t fixed the clumsy stitches that were keeping her together.
“Are you—are you going to break up?”
“Disband? Who knows?”
Revi shrugged.
“We’ll probably go to an inn and drink until we throw up for a week. And then? I don’t know. Ever since we came to this city, to this inn, it seems like nothing’s gone right. It was nice while it lasted, you know? I even liked this place. But it’s too much. This place is too much.”
She turned away. Erin watched her go. After a while, Jelaqua walked up. The Selphid scratched at the stitches around her head.
“Don’t mind Revi. She only meant half of what she said.”
“She’s right, though. I got Ulrien killed. Bad things always happen around my inn. Around me. This isn’t the first time.”
The Selphid shook her head.
“Bad things always happen. You think you’re special in that? I lost over half my party in another inn. Tragedy doesn’t care where it happens.”
Erin looked at her. Jelaqua offered her a crooked smile.
“Don’t mind the head. There’s nothing important in it, anyways.”
“Is your body okay? Seborn said you might have problems.”
“Seborn? Oh, right. Well, I went on a Rampage. It’s a Selphid thing. Breaks muscles, and I can’t heal them like you can. And I took damage…I need a new body. But I don’t think I can get one, so I’ll manage with this.”
Jelaqua shrugged. She’d broken bones in the fight, and talked about inserting iron rods to keep things in place. Erin only nodded.
“Will you stay?”
“Us? Yeah, sure. We can’t really leave. It’s hard finding another inn.”
“If you needed to, I could—”
“We’ll stay.”
The Selphid quietly rested a hand on Erin’s shoulder. The [Innkeeper] nodded. She wiped at her face. Jelaqua patted her on the shoulder as Erin cried.
“I won’t forget. Regrika. I won’t forget.”
“I know. I won’t either.”
“She told me she’d kill me. And Bird. And you all. Everyone. I won’t forget her. I’ll find her and someday…”
“I know. Come on. Let’s get you sitting down. Come on.”

The second person that Ryoka told was Krshia. The Gnoll sat in her apartment. It was too empty without Brunkr in it. She looked at Ryoka.
“Who ordered Regrika?”
“I can’t say.”
“She is a traitor to our species. Tell me.”
“I can’t tell you, Krshia. It’s too dangerous. But believe me. Regrika’s not a proper Gnoll and she never was.”
Krshia stared at her. Her paws were clenched. Ryoka looked at her, waiting. If Krshia grabbed her, she wouldn’t resist.
