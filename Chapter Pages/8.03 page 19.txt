“When? And if she does—will Hectval not come back and try to kill her again? If she comes back, I will come back. But before she does, I will go to Hectval. My room is nearly full. I think more arrows will collapse the floor. So I will go and then come back. It is less efficient than having all the arrows at once. But that is fine.”
He put down the arrow to dry and reached for another. A piece of Bevussa’s feather.
His fingers were trembling slightly as he cut another piece off. Selys reached out to stop him.
“Bird. Enough. You can’t do this.”
“Yes I can. I should have. I should not have stopped. Miss Lyonette was wrong.”
“Erin would not want this.”
“Erin is dead.”
The Drake recoiled. Rose backed up, behind Ishkr. All his fur was standing on edge. There was sound in Bird’s voice that he had never heard before. The Worker looked at them.
“I am going to go to Hectval. They killed Erin. So. I will kill them.”
He gestured to the bundles of arrows.
“I will kill their army. I will kill their Council. I will kill their Scalespeaker. Then, I will kill all of them. Until there is nothing left in Hectval. That is what I will do. Please do not interfere. I have work to do.”
From anyone else it sounded like hyperbole. And that would have been bad enough. But Ishkr knew Bird. He meant every word.
“Even the children, Bird?”
“That is what all of them means, Selys.”
“That’s murder.”
Rose whispered. Bird looked up.
“Yes.”
The three stood there. Looking at each other in the sudden silence. In the sudden…Ishkr looked around. He had been here day after day and not known what Bird was conceiving.
Madness. Selys shuddered.
“You can’t do this, Bird. Erin wouldn’t allow it. I won’t. I—I haven’t forgiven Hectval. But this is insane. You’ll die.”
“No, I will not. And why is it not allowed, Selys?”
“It’s wrong.”
“We are at war with Hectval. They are the enemy. I am not wrong. If you would like me to join the army, I will do so. Maybe they will give me arrows.”
“No. Bird—you can’t kill them all. That’s not right. That’s—an eye for an eye. It’s not right.”
Rose struggled, trying to put it into words. Bird just looked at her until she flinched and stared at the ground.
“Then have you forgiven Hectval, Rose? Miss Selys? Ishkr?”
“No, but—”
“They have done a terrible thing.”
The Antinium whispered.
“So I shall do a terrible thing to them. Until they are gone.”
“It won’t bring Erin back, Bird. Ishkr, say something. Ishkr—it won’t make you feel better, Bird.”
Rose turned to Ishkr. But the Gnoll was silent. Bird looked at Rose.
“Feel better. Bring Erin back. These are strange things you say, Rose. I did not plan this to have any of this happen. I chose to do this because I want them dead. Not to feel better. Not to bring Miss Erin back. Your logic is faulty. Mine is simple. Hectval exists. I wish it to be gone. I will never forgive them.”
He put down another arrow. Then looked at his bow.
“Please tell Erin I will be back if she does return. I will be leaving tonight, Ishkr.”
The Gnoll hesitated. Selys looked at him—then shook her head.
“No, Bird. This isn’t right. I have to tell…”
Who? Lyonette? Zevara? The person who should know, who could stop Bird was…
Pawn? Maybe one of them. Selys turned. Bird slowly drew an arrow.
“No, Miss Selys. You will not.”
She heard a terrible concentration in his voice. Selys’ [Dangersense] began to ring. She turned. She should—
An arrow thunked into the wood right past her face. She recoiled with a small scream.
“Bird!”
Ishkr and Rose ducked. Bird had another arrow on the string. Two more in his other hands.
