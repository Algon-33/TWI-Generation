Aaron had questions. Many of them. Would he stay around? Teach Aaron more? He had told Aaron—
“—That I could not teach you magic because you knew naught. Now is different. I shall teach you great spells, Aaron Vanwell. Help you find what was hidden here. After this day, you shall not want for knowledge. That is the pact we have made.”
The stranger finished Aaron’s sentence. The young man stirred. In the back of his mind—a little voice spoke up. At distance, at great remove. Aaron frowned, and then voiced it with effort.
“I—forgive me, sir. But why are you doing this? Why for me?”
Emerrhain’s smile did not flicker; but it deepened. With another layer of meaning. He sat there, on the bed.
“Because I chose you. Of all the ones I could have chosen. I chose you. And you accepted. You were the one I judged most worthy. Not all of my companions were so lucky. They misjudged their opportunities. I choose you. Perhaps there could have been one other. But she is lost to me. And we three had no idea what to give her. You?”
He looked at Aaron.
“You want to know. And that aligns with me perfectly.”
Aaron nodded. And yet—he shivered.
“I asked you questions, sir. And you helped me. But I didn’t promise you anything, did I? I just…took your hand.”
He said that, almost, almost pleadingly. Emerrhain looked at him. His smile never wavered.
“Yes. That was enough. Now, Aaron. There is something I would like you to do for me. Quickly. We have just today.”
He rose, as if they had said enough. Aaron rose involuntarily. He followed the figure to a place in his rooms where he could make a magical circle, if he knew how. The man stopped and Aaron did too. He had only one more question he could ask, before Emerrhain spoke. He was already tracing something in the air for Aaron to copy.
“How—how many others are there? Will you tell me that at least?”
Emerrhain head turned. He thought of this question. The answer hung behind his lips. Then he seemed to think Aaron had earned it.
“Of those that yet still matter? Five.”
Five. The man laughed lightly as he drew, beckoning Aaron down to memorize it and copy it.
“There are more. A child. Lost ones. But six that matter, including I. And of we—only he and I succeeded. Time enough later, though. Now come, Aaron. The others pursue their business as they will it. You and I have work to do.”

The [Emperor] paced back and forth in front of the seated man. He had no details to work by. Just a beard. The outline of a figure, faint, in his vision.
The rustle of cloth. Laken knew—the man was in his late thirties at most. Still in a prime to sound by him, and by his figure.
Tall. Commanding by his nature. So again. So again.
They had said little thus far. And a lot.
“You have done well. And poorly. You abandoned your subjects and courted disaster. You took half of my advice.”
The voice was amused. Laken turned his head as he came to a stop.
“I did. Your advice was good. Not perfect, but good. Tamaroth.”
The name hung in the air and Laken listened to how it sounded. The figure smiled. Laken knew it.
“You should have listened to all of my advice and heeded it unstintingly.”
Laken frowned. Same as before, the other man spoke down to him. Laken did not like it. He felt as though each word were from a leader to a follower. And he did not follow this man.
This…
“I took your advice, and I thank you for it. But let’s not play about with words. I listened to you, but it feels as though I gave you something for your free advice. Something I did not intend to give you. Especially if you show up here. Now. Today.”
