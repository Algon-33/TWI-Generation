The nightmare was over. The Raskghar were defeated. The exhilaration and palpable relief was gone from the city, the celebrations had passed Erin by. So what was left wasn’t joy and it wasn’t fear. It was…
Melancholy, perhaps. Not everyone smiled. Because Liscor had not survived without wounds. Drakes had died. Gnolls had been sacrificed. The Watch and Embria’s soldiers had died during the battle, as had Antinium. Adventurers had fallen.
There was grief there. Grief, relief…Erin walked down the streets, looking from face to face. And the Drakes and Gnolls looked back at her. So much had happened. So much death and violence. So much sadness.
But there had been happy moments too. Erin closed her eyes as she walked. What could you say after all of it? The bags of money weighed down her sides. But that was just gold. She thought of Mrsha, of Ceria. Of the Goblins. Things had changed. Was it better now? Surely it must be. The Raskghar had been defeated. The Goblins saved. There were scars, and yet—
“Excuse me? Miss?”
Erin turned her head. She stopped as pair of Gnolls came up to her. They were both female, both young. Teens, in fact. They were taller than Erin, but they looked far too young compared to Krshia and far too old compared to Mrsha. Erin smiled. She’d never seen Gnoll teenagers before. The two looked down at Erin. One had dark black fur, the other greyish.
“Hi there. Can I help you?”
The two teens sniffed Erin. The black-furred one looked uncertain, but then her friend spoke up.
“You’re…Erin Solstice, yes? The [Innkeeper]?”
“That’s me.”
The two exchanged a look.
“Good. We wanted to thank you. Humans shake hands, don’t they? Here.”
The two held out their hands. Erin stared at them and then awkwardly took both hands at once. The Gnolls shook her hands.
“I’m flattered. But why are you thanking me?”
The two looked surprised. The black-furred one shook herself slightly, spraying Erin with a few drops.
“Because you saved our friends! You helped defeat the Raskghar! We heard all about it. We—all the Gnolls—owe you a debt.”
“Liscor does.”
Her friend nodded. Erin turned red as she realized why they were looking at her so intently.
“Hold on, I didn’t do much! I just helped.”
“But you came up with the plan, yes?”
“No, well, yeah, but—I didn’t do much fighting!”
“But you did convince the Goblins to betray the Raskghar, right? We heard all about that.”
The two Gnolls nodded. Erin stammered.
“W-well…”
“I didn’t know Humans were that smart.”
“I didn’t know they were that brave. I heard you were just a troublemaker who kept dangerous monsters at her inn. People called you ‘that crazy Human’.”
“They did? I mean—who did?”
The two Gnolls looked at each other.
“Um…people. The point is, we’re really grateful. One of our friends was one of the people you saved. So, thank you. Really.”
“Yes, really. We work at a [Butcher]’s. It isn’t fun.”
The black-furred Gnoll nodded in agreement with her friend.
“Not at all. But come by and we’ll give you good meat. Cheap! Our boss wants to meet you too. He’s our father.”
“Yeah. Come by. Thank you again. Do we shake hands when we leave?”
The two Gnolls chatted with Erin a bit longer and then left. She waved at them, bemused and then looked around. Some of the other Drakes and Gnolls had paused to stare at Erin. A few waved. Some pointed. Erin blushed.
