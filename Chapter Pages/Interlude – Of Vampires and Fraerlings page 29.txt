Interlude – Of Vampires and Fraerlings
Page 29
“The world is unfair, Fierre. I think your [Martial Artist] friend envies…whatever you are.”
The little man looked up at her. The Vampire, holding him on one shoulder, bared her teeth nervously.
“I…what are you going to do?”
“Hm. What’s logical. For now, you have my word that keeping my secret earns my gratitude. I remember my friends. Believe me, I’m one of the best people to keep secrets. I’ve met more than one group that has secrets.”
She nodded, heart pounding. It was true, the Titan had knowledge of her. She had knowledge of him. One would decay, but in this moment?
He was helping her. What was that worth? The Titan looked back at the camp.
“Proof positive. You’re strong. You’re quick, and you’re tough. But what you have that Garia Strongheart lacks is this.”
He pointed at her.
“No potion. No need for it. You trashed her in sparring.”
“Well, yes. She was exhausted. You made me do it!”
Fierre felt bad. Niers just laughed at her. Guffawed in her face.
“So what? She’ll level up. And you…you just beat your friend. Because she cannot keep up with you. Whatever you are, you have the endurance a Selphid would turn green at. Keep them away from your body, incidentally.”
She nodded. Fierre’s heart was beating fast. The moon shone vividly out between the passing clouds. She felt…alive.
“But I am weaker. I cannot level. Not…not as easily. Is there a way for me to get stronger?”
The Titan’s eyes glowed.
“There is. I feel it. I am the Titan of Baleros. Go and join them, and follow my orders. I’ll whisper it in your ear.”
The Vampire looked at the group he had gathered. Niers had chosen them, out of seemingly nowhere. Because he had sensed something from them. He was no expert. Especially at this—but he knew how to train everything.
A Soldier. Gothica. Ulvama and Fierre stood together, looking confused. Snapjaw hurried over.
“Had to pee, sorry.”
“That’s fine. Um…we’re going to walk. Or run?”
“More training?”
The [Shaman] sneered at Fierre, but she had a curious look in her eyes. How much did she guess? She stared the Vampire girl up and down, but didn’t spot Niers’ hiding place in Fierre’s hair.
“Why are we walking?”
Gothica wobbled on her feet. Fierre replied as Niers had told her.
“Because we might discover something about ourselves. Do you want…power?”
The others looked at her. The Soldier tilted his head a few times. Why me? He didn’t even have paint. Fierre didn’t know either.
“Follow me.”
Under the moon, their shadows stretched long across the grass. Fierre looked at her shadow, many times taller than she was. She imagined the Vampire she had dreamed of being from those old stories.
Fear, yes. But awe, too. Awe at the stories of the night hunters, who were tall.
Graceful. Beautiful, undying. Masters of powerful magic. She had been cured by Ryoka. Yet Fierre didn’t feel like that.
The air was cold. Some of the others shivered; summer was passing. But the air felt…charged. The moon disappeared behind some clouds as they walked. Without purpose. Then…Ulvama looked back.
“Camp’s far away. What is happening? You using a Skill?”
She peered at Fierre. The Vampire girl started. She looked back and saw the camp was far away. How fast were they going?
Fast. They were striding along, exhaustion forgotten. Even Gothica and the Soldier. But something else was different. Was the camp…smaller?
The answer came as the moon appeared from beyond the clouds. Fierre turned. She gasped, as she saw the shadows stretching below them on the grass.
