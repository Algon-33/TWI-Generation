…It went straight through the canteen. Straight through Anazurhe’s hand. As if neither were there. It fell into the ground and vanished. Valeterisa’s head followed the small stream down. Anazurhe looked at Rags.
“Hmm? Only a special barrier keeps it inside, you see.”
Rags stared at the liquid. Then at Anazurhe. She flicked her eyes back to the scattered bounty, and her eyes opened wide.
“Does it…do anything?”
“Spirits drink this. But ethereal poison? Very bad. You take an arrow, dip it, and it goes through armor. Like that one’s sword.”
She looked at Redscar. Valeterisa nodded happily.
“Goblins have their own version of a Ghost Touch liquid. Fascinating. I have never seen this kind of potion, although I do not foray into alchemy…”
“Yes, yes. Shut up. This is hard to get. This is a drink. If an [Alchemist] uses the ingredients…maybe an antidote goes through her, you see? Your ice cube.”
Rags was hopping from foot to foot. Yes! Yes! That did seem likely! Anazurhe smiled.
“And I get the partial bounty. Twenty two thousand gold! Everyone wins!”
“Where can we get it? How is it made? Do you know?”
“Hmm. I know how. Or I can remember from [Shamans] past. The problem is…ingredients are rare. Rarer than Kraken Hearts, maybe.”
Rags stopped dancing.
“…Where are they? Do you have any?”
“I did. I used them to make this, see?”
The Goblin [Witch] helpfully held out the useless amphora of ghost happy-juice. Rags was tempted to kick it into the fountain.
“Do you have more ingredients? Where are they?”
“I know of three.”
Anazurhe was enjoying Rags’ impatience. She held up three fingers.
“One comes from fish deep in the ocean. Hard to get. Drowned Folk maybe can get it. The second? A Baleros creature deep in the jungles. Might be none left. Both are one in a decade.”
No, no, no! Rags was tearing at her hair. So close and yet—no wonder not even Oteslia had any! Anazurhe waited until Rags was about to explode, and then smiled.
“Fortunately, Chieftain Rags, the last one is more plentiful. There is one place to get it. Or rather…one tribe in Izril grows the mushroom. Harvests it. Uses it. Maybe they are dead. Maybe they live. I think, with the Goblin Lord, they may be dead, but maybe some remain.”
“Who?”
Rags stared at Anazurhe. The Great Witch smiled.
“The Ghostly Hand tribe.”
Rags stared at her. Anazurhe went to inform Oteslia of the possible solution and put in for a partial bounty. Rags just stood there. How…how was she supposed to get there? In southern Izril? How in the—?

“Shoo. Shoo.”
Numbtongue kept urging the little Goblins away as they followed the Gnolls to their tribe. The [Hunters] were tolerant, but the Goblins were still putting them all in danger.
Even so, the annoying Goblins with the white handprint on their skin could tell he was a Hob. One kept poking him.
“You Hob. We Goblins.”
“Yes. Go away.”
“We have tribe.”
“Good for you. Go away.”
“You visit?”
“No.”
“Please?”
“No.”
“You have ghosts. Chieftain have ghosts. We show?”
“N—what?”
The Goblin grinned at him and stared at Pyrite. The Hob stared back. He waved slowly. She grinned wider and waved back.

Hope. Secrets. Other tribes. Rags was mixed on what she’d learned, but she felt in her marrow she’d found a clue. Healer of Tenbault aside.
This was something, if she could get to Goblinhome. Anazurhe assured her that she could help speed and aid their journey. They would also go with something from Valeterisa, who kept avoiding Rags mentioning payback for the notes.
