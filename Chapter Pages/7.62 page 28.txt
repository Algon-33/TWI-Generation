“Not bad. But he’s no Sserys. Mark that target. I want him alive. Now. Grind them down.”

The day had been going so well. The week. The month was acceptable. The year really bad as a whole.
But it had been fine, even if he had not known it was so. Up until the letter.
The Wall Lord of Salazsar sat on his desk. He read it again. At the same time the half-Elf [Cryomancer] and the [Necromancer] cried out as if struck.
At the same time the [Emperor] was told, and summoned Griffon Hunt. It came from Liscor. Lyonette.
 
To Friends of The Wandering Inn.
Erin Solstice has been mortally wounded in an attack by a Drake raiding party from the City of Hectval. She was struck by poisoned arrows.
She was unable to be healed. Her heart stopped. However, her body was frozen. Preserved.
Erin is not dead. Nor is she alive. I am writing to you to inform you of this. And to ask for your help. If you know of anything, have anything that can bring back someone whose heart is stopped and is frozen, please reply immediately.
She is not dead. [Detect Death] does not work on her. Nor [Detect Life]. She is currently resting in the [Garden of Sanctuary] in The Wandering Inn. More news about a way to revive her will be sent.
–Lyonette
 
The Wall Lord read it again. He felt like someone had removed the top of his head. As he had when Periss…
Zel Shivertail.
But her? He imagined the laughing young woman again, leaning on the table.
“Hey Ilvriss. Ilvriss! Try this mayo. Good, huh? Fancy shmancy enough for you?”
It seemed inconceivable that she would die. Not die? He read it again.
Heart stopped. Frozen.
Dead. Revive someone with…? The Wall Lord shook his head. He read the lines once more, pausing on silly details.
‘I am writing to you to inform you of this.’ What a redundant line. Yet—the shaking words spoke to the young woman’s state of mind.
The Wall Lord’s head bowed. Hectval? He didn’t even know where it was on the map.
“Which fools took away one of the greatest assets Izril had? Which city burns?”
The Wall Lord of Salazsar’s claws tightened. Call for the armies! For vengeance! For—
He caught himself. Then he just sat there.
“Erin Solstice.”
Ilvriss sat. How long he could not say. Then he rose. He walked out of his office. Towards the adjoining one.
“Alrric?”
“Wall Lord?”
The Gnoll started as he saw Ilvriss standing in the doorway. He rose from his desk.
“Ilvriss? What’s the matter? You look—”
The Wall Lord passed a hand over his face. He looked past Alrric. He shook his head.
“A friend. A friend—no. Alrric. Please send word. I am headed to Salazsar’s war room. Have the First Strategist of Salazsar meet me, and a scrying orb found. Find me…Hectval.”
The Gnoll [Administrator] hesitated. He saw Ilvriss turn.
“To what end, Wall Lord?”
“To look upon the greatest fools of Izril, Alrric. The enemies of the Walled Cities.”
The door slowly closed. Ilvriss walked down the hall. He stopped and leaned on a doorway. Then continued on. Simply that.
As if he’d been stabbed.

“Liscor is in trouble. Grand Strategist. Grand Strategist?”
Chaldion ignored the younger [Strategist]’s commentary. He was standing in the war room of Pallass. Just watching the battle. Someone was murmuring to him.
“Pallass has a treaty with the Hectval Alliance. We cannot make war on them, Grand Strategist.”
“I know that. I oversaw the last conflict and peace settlement.”
The Grand Strategist murmured. He half-turned his head.
“Besides which. There’s no point. Isn’t that right, Grimalkin?”
