Lyonette nearly choked on her tongue. As one, the Workers and Soldiers began waltzing in pairs. At first it was only simple moves. Step forwards, step back. Turn. But then they began moving and performing more complex moves. Lyonette watched in amazement as the Antinium performed a minuet, flawless peel off, and then a promenade down the floor. The bulky Soldiers and Workers moved down the floor, passing by Lyonette and Pawn.
“It is a wonderful thing. This form of dancing. It is relaxing. Elegant. Both Workers and Soldiers can do it together. I think it is what we were looking for.”
Pawn looked back at Lyonette. She stared at him.
“This?”
He nodded.
“The Antinium cannot go outside now. Many of us do not know what to do. We have no purpose outside our function. But this? This is not what we were designed for. This is something special that we can do with each other. It is beautiful and we can make it.”
“That’s true.”
Lyonette remembered balls with gold and magic. She remembered rooms packed with the famous, the powerful. She had seen wonderful dancing, seen the Lord of the Dance himself take to the floor. But this was magical in its own way. The dancing Antinium lit something in her. She looked at Pawn.
He was a Worker. The same as so many others. But different. Oh, so different. Lyonette felt it. Did she like him? Did he really like her? She didn’t know, but something in her prompted to hold out her hands.
“Shall we?”
“I would be delighted.”
The two took hands. They stepped out into the pairs of the Antinium. Alone in a room filled with bodies. Together. Lyonette whirled with Pawn holding her.  In that moment as she danced with him they spoke, honestly, close together.
“I’m not a good [Princess], Pawn. I never was.”
“That does not matter to me. I just wanted you to be happy.”
“And I can’t be without my class?”
“I think you could be. But I think you do not have to lose something to be happy.”
“Nothing stays the same, Pawn. Things change.”
“But nothing ever disappears. The past matters.”
“That’s true. But what would I be?”
She felt Pawn’s other two hands pick her up. Lyonette felt her feet leave the ground as he gently lifted her. She felt breathless. The Antinium were made for such a maneuver.  Pawn stared at her.
“You would be a [Princess] in an inn.”
“That’s not enough. I need something else. A [Princess] must have subjects. She must have a kingdom. I have neither.”
“What about me?”
“What about you?”
“I could be your subject. I think I would be a good one. I follow orders.”
Pawn.
Lyonette grabbed his hands and looked seriously into his eyes.
“You have subjects. You can’t abandon them.”
“I know. But I cannot leave you alone either. Is that love?”
“I think so.”
Lyonette closed her eyes. She stepped with Pawn, showing him more forms as they moved on. In silence, they danced. Until Pawn spoke.
“Is that why you gave up your class? Because you left them?”
“Who?”
“Your subjects. Your kingdom.”
“My subjects?”
Lyonette froze. She opened her mouth to protest that they weren’t hers and stopped. Wasn’t she a [Princess]? Weren’t they hers? Even a sixth princess had duties. She hesitated.
“I…I never thought of them.”
“I see.”
Distracted, Lyonette looked away. She bit her lip.
“I might not be able to get my class back, Pawn.”
“I think you will. If you want to.”
“Why are you so certain?”
“Because I know you. Because I believe in you. Because you are wonderful.”
