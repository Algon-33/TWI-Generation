The Brass Dragon murmured, closing his eyes. And he saw Magnolia Reinhart in his mind.
“Besides, that girl’s far too young to achieve that. Even if it were possible. Not as young as she is.”
Where was that little brat? Not sixteen years old and she thought she could trick—no. Wait. Was it thirty? Forty?
Teriarch froze. His notes began to play, but he cut them short with a wave of one claw. He tried to concentrate. It felt like he’d just spoken to her before having his nap. Let’s see—she had been here.
The Dragon tapped the floor. And bleeding? Had Ressa failed to guard her? She was forty—no—
“No. She was—is—sixteen. Always pestering. Her and that carriage and that uppity little [Maid]-[Assassin]. She wants to paint it pink?”
The Dragon concentrated on his latest memory. Clinging to it. He nodded, going back. That was Magnolia Reinhart. She was going to meet him in the Dawn Gazebo. The brat was late.
Empress Sheta?
Teriarch opened one eye. Who had he been thinking of? He rose, unsteadily. Why was it so dark? It should be dawn. Was he late?
His notes chimed in his head, trying to tell him something. The Dragon brushed them away. No—that wasn’t right.
“Concentrate.”
Of course. Ger. He must be in one of the mud palaces. Poor housing for a Dragon, but it was all they had. That was who he was meeting.
The Quarass of Germina? Yes—yes. They had arranged to meet in the flowering grasslands of Zeikhall since the rains had brought the blooms for the first time in three decades. What was he doing lazing around here?
The Dragon walked out of his cave. Looked around. Then his notes chimed again.
High Passes. The Dragon recoiled, hurried back inside his cave. He closed his eyes, murmuring a spell.
Magnolia…? How old was she?
And the answer was there. The Dragon’s face fell. And the image of the young woman, the uppity teenager—was replaced by a magical image of a woman full-grown. Her youth turned slightly bitter, but still—so willful.
“Forty two? So old. That is surely not…”
The Dragon wanted to deny what he saw. And part of him did. He closed his eyes, banishing the image. This was just a figment of his imagination. A mistake.
He would wake from the dream, and meet the [Empress].
The Quarass waited.
Magnolia Reinhart was playing a prank.
All of these things were true, and none. The Dragon was still waking. But now, he was afraid. Of no mortal thing. Not the little thing in the High Passes. Not his death, whenever it came, or armies.
But of this sense of unreality. Had he imagined her? Magnolia? Did she even exist to begin with?
The Dragon was afraid to consult his notes again. He just lay there, waiting for reality to reassert itself. But it never did. So—he debated sleeping again. Until it all made sense.
He closed his eyes.
And then heard a voice. It was real. So wonderfully real it snapped him back to reality.
“Hello? Will you let me in?”
It was coming from outside. His ward spells had caught the intruder—no—just held her back. She was running her hands across the stone, which was real and solid to her.
“I need to speak to you. Please. Let me in. Teriarch?”
“Ah, I knew it was a prank.”
The Dragon relaxed, and smiled. He murmured a spell and the visitor stumbled into his cavern. The Dragon drew himself upright, trying to be imposing.
“You have some nerve returning here, wretch. Be grateful I do not incinerate you on the spot.”
The intruder stopped. The Dragon saw with eyes keener than any hawk that it was a young woman. She raised her hands, babbling, distraught.
