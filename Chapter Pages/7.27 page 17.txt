“There are too many people I know up there. There’s Lupp, for one. I’ll bring you some corn. And I will come back. But I will have to go back.”
“Not today.”
Erin’s statement was joined by Mrsha’s nodding. She hugged Ryoka tighter. The City Runner found it getting hard to breathe.
“No. But Erin—Mrsha. There’s something else. I’m still worried about bringing trouble here.”
“Into the Garden? Let them come. Even that Grand Mage dude couldn’t get in. The only person who ever got in here without my say-so was this [Druid] dude. And that was a special case.”
Erin folded her arms. Ryoka smiled. She’d heard about that, too.
“Probably a function of his class, Erin. But I told you about…the [Witches]. The bad [Witch].”
Mrsha hugged Ryoka—this time shivering a bit. Erin shivered too.
“Yeah. You never said her name.”
“I shouldn’t. Names have power.”
Ryoka looked about. The shadow of Belavierr hung around her, even here. She shook her head, feeling at the vial again.
“…There are things I have to do. Give this to Fierre, anyways.”
She showed them the little vial. Erin gulped. It was a tiny amount of liquid, even by potion standards. But it was a panacea.
“Maybe you could give that to Saliss. If they could replicate it…”
“I doubt it. Besides—I don’t trust anyone with this. Even if I thought Octavia could do it…no. It was a gift.”
Even if you took a few drops to experiment with, it was cutting into Fierre’s cure. Ryoka shook her head. She didn’t know this ‘Saliss of Lights’. A Named Adventurer? Erin said Saliss was ‘cool’, but what did that mean?
“So this Grand Mage Eldavin guy gave it to you. And he’s your ally. But you won’t tell me how he’s so…and why do you trust him with Earth? You?”
Erin waved her hands. Ryoka sighed.
“I can’t tell you everything. Not even you, Mrsha. I promised. Sorry. But I’ll tell you all I can. The reason I think I might have to go is…Ivolethe.”
Mrsha looked up. So did Erin. Ryoka slowly withdrew the shining figure of ice. Mrsha touched it and recoiled at the frost.
“Isn’t she…?”
Erin stared somberly at the figure. Ryoka shook her head. She closed her hand over the figure. But gently.
“She’s alive. There’s a way to meet her again. I don’t know what it will take. But that’s why Eldavin is here. He’s…an expert. And I need his help. Whatever it takes…”
She looked into the distance. Erin Solstice looked at her friend. And she saw Ryoka’s eyes focus.  She listened to the things Ryoka hadn’t said.
A dark [Witch]. An [Emperor] who held Goblins. A Vampire, a [Fistfighter]…
That was Ryoka Griffin’s world. And while she had come here, come back, she was already being tugged towards her other life, in Reizmelt. Mrsha tapped on Ryoka’s chest. She looked up pleadingly.
Don’t go. Not today. Ryoka hesitated, then gently combed her fingers through Mrsha’s fur.
“Not yet. But I have to sometime, Mrsha. I have responsibilities, you understand?”
She didn’t know if Mrsha did. But the Gnoll was growing up. She nodded and hugged Ryoka again.
“Let’s not talk about later. Let’s just—you know. Be here. Okay?”
Erin wanted Ryoka to stay. She wanted to tie weights around Ryoka’s legs so she couldn’t run off. Things were better with Ryoka around. She was sensible. Even if she was sometimes stupid. But she—listened. Ryoka smiled, brief humor flashing across her features.
“Okay. You have to tell me about this mess you’re in, Erin. Wistram [Mages] in your inn? Pallass? That Grimalkin guy? You have a weights room. What did I say about bringing inventions into this world?”
