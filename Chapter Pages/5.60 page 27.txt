Pebblesnatch was in Erin’s inn, peeking out from the kitchen. She’d recovered her prized hat, which had somehow ended up on Garry’s head last night. Unlike the others, she hadn’t gone outside. She was…afraid. She’d stayed in Erin’s warm kitchen and the young woman had let her. She could understand Pebblesnatch’s fear. The Goblin and Gnoll looked at each other warily, and Erin saw Apista buzzing around the flowers.
No Lyonette. She was in Liscor getting some food since the Goblins had cleaned Erin out of everything. It was expensive; food was at a premium due to the impending siege. Still, Erin had money to burn. There were no Horns or Halfseekers. They were in the city. It was just Erin, and an army of Goblins outside.
“What’s going to happen?”
Erin asked the question out loud, but no one responded. She heard a sound from outside and turned. The door opened. To Erin’s surprise, Relc ducked into the inn. He grinned at her and waved.
“Hey! Lots of Goblins out there, am I right? Scary bastards. Whoops, there’s one here too. Hey, I’m not here to pick a fight.”
He raised his claws as Pebblesnatch backed up. Erin stared at Relc. Why was he here?
“Why are you here, Relc? I thought you hated Goblins.”
“Yeah, I’m still not keen on them. But I uh, was in the neighborhood. On a walk, y’know, and I thought I’d come by.”
The [Guardsman] grinned at Erin unconvincingly. She raised an eyebrow.
“A walk, huh? Well, can I get you a drink?”
“Ooh, yeah! I forgot you have drinks! I’ll have—”
“Here.”
Erin poured him an ale. Relc blinked at it but drank it down willingly. He sighed.
“That hits the spot. Remember when you didn’t have any alcohol? Instead you had that blue, sweet stuff. Those were the days.”
“They were.”
Erin leaned over the counter. Relc grinned at her and waved at Mrsha. The little Gnoll didn’t know him well enough to come over. He relaxed, the picture of sloth, but Erin detected something else from Relc today. She looked casually at him.
“So why did you come here?”
“Me? Well, like I said, I was in the area…”
Relc avoided Erin’s gaze. He was playing with something. A letter, opened and folded up again. Erin eyed it.
“Okay. Well, can I help you with anything else? Food?”
“Nah, I’m good.”
Now that was surprising. Erin blinked at Relc. He just smiled at her. He stared out the window.
“Lots of Goblins. That reminds me of old times too, right? Except there’s more of them.”
“Yeah.”
Erin said the word with finality. Relc’s grin slipped.
“Right. I’ve uh—look, it’s not that I think this is your fault.”
“Glad to hear it.”
The young woman picked up the dust rag and swabbed the counter. Relc coughed.
“It’s just that you tend to do weird things—and I was thinking—well, it’s sort of like the Face-Eater Moth attack. Or Skinner. Or that time you rescued Ceria from the dungeon and then we all got our tails kicked by that jerk, Gazi. And you poked her in the eye. A Named Adventurer. I mean, it’s sort of like that, right?”
“I guess?”
Erin looked blankly at Relc. Why was he bringing up the past? The painful past, come to that. Relc hesitated.
“So the Goblin Lord’s coming here. And the Humans. Damn Humans. Hate them. Ugly fleshbags, am I right?”
He grinned at Erin. She frowned.
“Yeah? Well, I don’t like the fact that they’re coming to Liscor either. Or the Goblin Lord. He sounds like a jerk.”
“Exactly! So…can you do anything?”
“About what?”
“This.”
Relc waved a hand in the air. He looked at Erin.
“You know. Something. Do your Erin thing. Make things work out right. Can you…can you help?”
