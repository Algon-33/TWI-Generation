Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)

A [Storm Captain] strode over the decks. His [Storm Sailors] charged a group of Drowned Folk who snarled—another Octopus-type spat ink into the faces of the [Storm Sailors] before a crossbow bolt took her down.
Inky was standing next to Wil, aiming Delivan’s crossbow; the [First Mate] was desperately trying to steer the ship out of danger. Merrik and Peki were defending the Helm. But the ships kept coming.
“We can’t get away. Wil—”
Yerranola was shouting as she thrust back a pair of [Storm Sailors]. They stabbed her—the Selphid buried her hatchet in one head, ignoring the blades in her chest. Wil pointed his wand, blew the other [Sailor] off her.
It was a hopeless battle. All he could think was that they had to abandon the chest. But even that was—
Difficult. There was nowhere to run and the chest itself was being guarded. Fetohep stood in front of it, calmly looking around. An enemy [Storm Sailor] stumbled through Captain Lasc’s defenders. He looked up.
“Thief.”
The undead [King] swung a blade made of sand. Sand—but it cut through the [Storm Sailor]’s face. Fetohep calmly blocked two more [Depth Sailors] slashing at him. The ruler of Khelt turned, and his blade cut both down, finding holes in their guard.
He was a [Warrior]. And a good one! Even the other high-level [Warriors] were avoiding him. And—Fetohep looked amused.
In this battle, there was no amusement in Wil’s heart. Just thundering adrenaline. But Fetohep wasn’t the only one.
“Hail to Lord Seagrass!”
A form swung across the air. The [Storm Captain] cutting towards Lasc turned. Just in time for Rasea to shear the top of his head off. The [Storm Sailors] cried out as Rasea the Shining landed among them with four members of her crew. They diced the invaders in a blur. Then they pointed at Wil’s group.
“Oh dead gods. Here they come—”
Yerra turned. She charged one of the four [Pirates]. Captain Lasc punched at another.
“I’ll take that one! Inky—the other! Wil, Feshi, cover us!”
Venaz cut with his battleaxe at the Drake with a cutlass. Wil aimed his wand as Feshi shot an arrow. The four [Pirates] slid across the deck. One was dueling Lasc—another cut Yerra straight down her body.
“Ah! Dead gods! They got my inner body!”
The Selphid shouted. She kicked and the Gnoll went flying.
“Rampaging!”
She roared as she charged forwards. Captain Rasea was laughing. She was dueling Fetohep himself. The [King]’s eyes flashed as he parried her enchanted blade, but his hardened sand-sword was breaking with each clash. Rasea speared him through the chest.
“Well done, mortal. Your name?”
“Rasea Zecrew. Your Majesty.”
She swept him a bow. Then beheaded the apparition. The sand-Fetohep collapsed.
Rasea reached for one of the Swords of Serept. A glowing, blue blade. Then she flicked her hand up.
Fetohep’s reaching hand missed hers by an inch. Rasea winked.
“Thought so. What a pain—”
The ruler of Khelt rose out of the ground again. He had reshaped himself out of the magical sand. Rasea grinned. She saluted him.
“Back up, lads! We need a full crew to grab that damn box!”
Her four [Pirates] and Rasea leapt backwards as more [Storm Sailors] flanked them from the left at Wil’s direction. None of them had fallen—and Venaz was bleeding. He cursed.
“They’re high-level. We can’t hold them off!”
“Crew of the Illuminary. On me.”
Captain Rasea stood at the railing. And Wil saw sixteen more shapes swinging onto the deck. His heart sank.
“Step aside, Lord Kallinad and you lot. Be a shame to cut your adventure short today.”
Rasea’s eyes glinted. Wil raised his sword and wand.
“Captain Rasea—”
