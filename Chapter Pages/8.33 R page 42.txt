I wrote too much. I was trying to rest, but I decided I could still finish a plot-heavy chapter. I stretched too far. This is exceptionally fast writing. Book 4 is out on e-book and Audible! Also, Diana Gill’s Q&A in the Discord is linked below!
And somehow, I also wrote the chapter. Did you see it coming?
The reveal with Rhisveri, I think many people could get. That he was something? Most people. Wyrm? Many.
That last part…well. We shall see. I have not written teh Relc chapter yet because I’ve been trying to rest, but the Patreon side story will come out! Then one more chapter…then I’ll probably take my break early August. I am burning through all my reserves and I don’t even have the coherence to end this author’s note properly. But I hope you enjoyed it.
Thanks, and check out those links! Book 4 is out! Thanks for reading!
PS: I’ll put the monthly Patreon poll up soon. Just…so…busy…
