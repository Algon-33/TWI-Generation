Paige informed the Selphid. Daly hesitated. He mimed at Luan. Is it okay for the Selphids to know? The [Rower] made a face and shrugged. They already knew through Calectus.
The Gnoll-Selphid looked confused.
“How do I say it?”
Geneva grimaced.
“I never finished my certification, Paige. Tell them—”
 
—-
 
“Wait, so she’s actually a real doctor? No way! How old is she?”
Erin gasped. She imagined a real doctor would be a lot older than anyone else she’d met! But of course—why not? What if this Geneva was in her sixties?
“How old is she, Ulinde?”
“Hold on! I need to send! I’m not Palt! I don’t do [Message] spells well!”
The [Spellslinger] was concentrating. Erin waited, bouncing up and down in her seat.
“I need to be careful what I say. I’m Joseph. Football, not soccer. Football, not soccer…”
She closed her eyes. Grew still. Erin leaned forwards.
“Listen, Ulinde. Don’t send what I say. Let me think about each response. And when you do send a [Message]—”
 
—-
 
“—Do it word-for-word. We’ll keep a log of this conversation. Hell, we’ll write down each response.”
Paige told the [Mage]. He nodded. Geneva Scala took a deep breath. Her heart was fluttering. Why was it racing? Idis was confused too.
“Why are you nervous? You know they’re from your world. Isn’t everyone here from Earth?”
“Yes, but—this is different, I—Okasha.”
Daly glanced at Geneva. He wavered, and then nodded.
“They’re on another continent. We should be careful about what we say, everyone.”
“You think we can’t trust them?”
Ken looked at Daly. The Bushranger’s Captain shrugged slowly.
“I say—just be careful.”
And then the conversation began. Paige’s pencil raced across the paper.
In The Wandering Inn, Erin jotted down her notes.

[Joseph] – Are you really a doctor, doctor? From Earth, I mean? Sorry—how old are you? I know it’s rude to ask…
[Geneva] – I’m twenty five. My name is Geneva. Hello, Joseph. Pleased to meet you.
[Joseph] – Oh! I’m really sorry. Hello! I’m Joseph. Pleased to meet you. You’re the first person from Earth I’ve met.
[Geneva] – Really? I’ve met other people.
[Joseph] – I haven’t. Who have you met? How many others?
 
 
In the company’s headquarters, Paige turned to the others and raised an eyebrow.
“You all believe that?”
The others murmured.
“They could have come alone. We shouldn’t have let on…”
“Trust is important.”
Ken’s voice. He looked at Geneva as the [Mage] waited. The [Diplomat] waited a beat.
“—But it is also important to be safe. Tell them…”
 
[Geneva] – There are others. I came with a group. Some were split apart. Others died. I’m sorry, I can’t be more specific. But there were dozens.
 
Erin Solstice sat back. Ulinde stopped speaking and saw the [Innkeeper]’s face. The young woman was white-faced.
“Dozens?”
And then—
“Died?”
“Erin. Are you alright? Should we get Lyonette?”
Jelaqua half-rose, concerned at Erin’s expression. The [Innkeeper] didn’t respond at first, so the Selphid opened the door. Ulinde saw Erin’s eyes flick towards her.
 
[Joseph] – From where? Were they all young? I’m from Spain. What about you?
[Geneva] – America.
[Geneva] – Wisconsin, Madison. The others were around my age.
[Joseph] – I see! That makes sense.
 
A pause. Erin cursed. Paige looked around at the others.
 
[Geneva] – How so?
[Joseph] – Was everyone from America?
[Geneva] – No. There were other countries mixed in. Why does everyone being young make sense? How old are you?
 
“Hey Joseph, how old are you?”
“What?”
“How old are—”
