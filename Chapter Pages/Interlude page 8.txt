They had to know. Drakes, not Humans. Az’kerash had been Human. This might be a plot. The Walled Cities had to know! Osthia tried to outrun whomever was chasing her, but they were faster and she was exhausted.
Closer now. But too far away. Osthia waved her arms desperately. Liscor was just in front of her. She cried out, her voice raw and unused.
“Help! Someone deliver a message to Pallass! It’s—”
The rider bore down on her. Osthia spun, ready to make a final stand. She had a sword looted from the dead. But it was no Human who rode the horse, or Klbkch. It was a Drake. He drew up and Osthia gaped up at him.
“You’re—”
His scales were dark red, no, closer to purple. He wore a breastplate that blazed with gold and fire that Osthia recognized. But it was his face that spoke to her.
“Wall Lord Ilvriss?”
He blinked. But Osthia knew him. A Wall Lord of Salazsar? What was he doing here?
“Who are you? Identify yourself. Are you a captive?”
He eyed her suspiciously. Osthia’s bindings gave her away. The Drake nodded, and then remembered to salute.
“I am. Wall Lord—sir! I was a prisoner of the Goblin Lord!”
“Goblins don’t take prisoners.”
Osthia blinked.
“This one did. But—sir, I have critical news! It must reach the Walled Cities! Now!”
She stumbled over her words. She had to say it.
“It’s the Necromancer. It’s Az’kerash. He’s alive! He—”
Ilvriss jerked in his saddle, but not with the pure shock Osthia had expected. Instead, he swung himself to the ground and practically leapt at Osthia. His claw covered her mouth. She jerked in surprise.
“Wall Lord—”
He muffled her. Ilvriss stared around, but no one was nearby. He ignored the female Drake’s protests and hissed at her.
“Quiet! I know.”
She went still, her eyes wide. Ilvriss glanced around again, and then straightened. He stared long and hard at Osthia.
“This Goblin Lord had ties to the Necromancer?”
“He was his apprentice. He—”
Osthia struggled to describe all she’d witnessed. Reiss’ subservience, his resentment, the reasons he’d followed the Necromancer. She couldn’t. But Ilvriss just nodded.
“You must have valuable intelligence. I will hear it. But not here. We’re too exposed. Follow me. What’s your rank and name, soldier?”
He offered Osthia a claw. She stared at him, and then swung herself up into the saddle. The horse grunted.
“Osthia. Osthia Blackwing, [Captain]. Pallass’ 5th Oldblood Winged Division. Wall Lord—”
“Say nothing.”
“But—”
The Drake gave her a long look. Ilvriss shook his head.
“This secret is our only advantage. We will make him pay. I swear it. But we must trap him. Come.”
He urged the horse into a trot, heading back towards Liscor. Osthia saw more Drakes racing to join him. They’d been—combing the dead. The undead, rather. For signs of the Necromancer? She stared at Ilvriss’ back. And then she remembered to ride to avoid falling off. She was exhausted, grieving, though she didn’t know why. But she burned with vengeance.
She would not forget him, ever. And the Necromancer would pay. She swore it. The Drakes rode away from the battlefield, towards the city. They passed another figure, who picked his way across the dead, slowly, stick in hand.

“Is this hell?”
I don’t know. I have always imagined hell, if it exists, as a place of suffering. A place of torment, as you would imagine. Screaming, pure agony distilled into an experience. But perhaps hell is quiet.
