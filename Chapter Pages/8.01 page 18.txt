“Improve. That is what we are doing today, Chesacre, Thaina! You see, if I do not have the ability to order the Free Antinium—that is a problem. What is the correct solution besides wiping them out and trying again? For that takes too much time.”
Neither Soldier responded. Voices. They would need them. Ah, well, Xrn was learning their sign language too. But neither one responded. They were looking at the door. Xrn smiled.
“The answer is: improve some to my standards. Chesacre, Thaina, I like you two. Therefore, I am going to risk your lives today. To make you better.”
The Soldiers edged to the door. They tried it. The door didn’t budge. Xrn went on, happily watching them and inspecting the rows of potions, vials, and so on she had sorted by strength. And more…
“They call me the Small Queen. But I have never sought to create my own Hive. Not once. For I am Xrniavxxel—unique. But it seems to me I have squandered my potential. It is fortunate that unlike Klbkch and Wrymvr, I am always willing to learn.”
She saw the Soldiers turn. Xrn walked over. Her eyes shone with anticipation. Hope. Determination.
“You two will be the first of mine. Or die. Endeavor not to.”
Thaina blocked Chesacre. Chesacre tried to interpose herself in front of Thaina. They both shielded the other, flinching, as Xrn studied them. They did nothing else. Just held each other as Xrn slowly raised a hand—
“Here. Drink this.”
Chesacre lowered a clenched fist. Thaina hesitated and clicked her mandibles. They stared at the potion. Xrn waved it impatiently.
“It is a mana potion. Drink. And then eat a Garry-pie. We will see what the first one does before…”

The conversation ran something like this.
“You see? I was surprised that your Hive did not consider it. After all the trouble. But it is a solution of sorts, so long as it is accepted. I calculate the odds at 21%, but they are possible. Liscor is a strange city. Not that I would know.”
“It is more than that.”
“How so?”
“It is…more than that. Does it hurt?”
That was to another person, who responded in nonverbal ways. The first was miffed.
“It would not hurt. They are designed not to.”
“I know. But it is strange. And…right. More than that.”
“You must explain with more verbiage, Pawn.”
“I do not know if I have the words. I only know that this is like something of which I was once told. Not ours. But it is right…righteous. It is—it will make them something else. I do not know if it is correct.”
“You just said—”
“I know what I said. My heart tells me this…this is necessary. Green Baron. What do you think?”
A reply.
“Yes. You would be the first. It is more than you know. More than…I do not know.”
“Why, Pawn? I agree. And I am Prognugator. You seem to agree.”
“I do. My heart tells me ‘yes’. My soul desires this. It is what we must be. It may be necessary. However. Something holds me back.”
“Which is?”
“Erin Solstice. If she were here, I believe she would stop me. I do not know if Lyonette would. But I think Erin would.”
“Why?”
“She is not here. I do not know. But I know. But we must be this, Erin. Yes. And no. It is only that, Dekass. Only a certainty.”
“Which is? Explain, Pawn.”
The second voice was silent. And at last, it spoke, weary. Tired. And so terribly sad.
“I think if she saw this, she would weep. I think she would cry for what it means. What we become. But she is not. And I cannot ask her what she would say. So I follow my own words. And they say this: rise, Green Baron. The rest of you. I will let you choose.”
