Author’s Note: If I were planning things out with the full energy and not playing it by ear, I’d do one more chapter at least because I like to work into the next month.
But I’m calling it here. You did not see the 41,000 word chapter—yet—but it is off to the editor and you will get it soon enough. I think it was a good one, and I was satisfied by the Wistram-Reim arc.
But that was a lot of words. Killer, really. I don’t have the same arm pain I used to, because I’ve learned stretches and practices, but I’ve had sore shoulders like you would get from exercise from…typing.
I need a rest. Especially to write quality. That’s why this chapter was short-er. The quality just decreases without rest, so I’ve learned that not writing is as important as writing.
I’ve told you this before. I’m just saying…I’ll be back and I hope you do like this chapter well enough, but brace for some good stuff. Thanks for reading this month! Gravesong is out for recording for the audiobook and we’re working on getting it to publishing mainly with audio rights delaying it, but it was a lot of revising during my ‘two week break’. I will take a longer, fuller one. After Volume 8.
Until then, just one week off. See you soon, and hope I recover! By playing video games, watching fun videos, and reading my own great stories! Later!
