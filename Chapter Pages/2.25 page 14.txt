“But. But if I don’t do anything, she’ll die. And maybe she deserves it. I don’t know. I can’t judge people. I don’t have the right. But I do know this: if she goes out, even if I give her money and supplies and Toren to guard her, she will die. She can’t make it alone. She can’t do…anything.”
Erin spread her hands out, a lone plaintiff in front of her silent jury.
“Why do people have to die? Why? Even if they do bad things—she’s just a kid. She might be horrible, but is that worthy of death? I don’t know. But I do know that if I don’t do anything, she will die. And that means her death will be because of me.”
The snow fell, and no one spoke. Erin took a deep breath.
“Another chance. It’s not about her. It’s not about one person. It’s not about doing the smart thing. It’s not even about doing the sensible thing. It’s about doing the right thing.”
She looked around. She looked into the shadows, and spoke to them.
“I can’t let people die. Not if I can help it. Not if there’s still a chance. She was a thief, but that was all. She didn’t kill people. And she needs help.”
Erin pointed back to her inn.
“I was alone, once. I was also useless. Maybe not as much as her but…someone saved me, once. They gave their life for me, and other people helped me survive. I wouldn’t be here without them. I won’t give up on her. Not yet. Not here. So—”
Erin broke off. She closed her eyes, and then spoke.
“So, if you want to get her, you’re going to have to go through me. Understand?”
For a second, all was still silence. And then it happened.
The shadows around the inn moved.
Gnolls stepped out of the shadows, tall, lithe figures shaking snow out of their fur. Covered as they’d been, they’d looked like part of the landscape. But now they appeared, and leading them was a Gnoll Erin recognized.
Brunkr stepped forwards. His chest muscles rippled under his fur as he stared down at Erin.
“She has harmed our Clan and deserves death. If you stand in our way, you will be our enemy.”
Erin sniffed. Wet dog. It was a familiar smell. She stared up at Brunkr.
“She is staying in my inn. She works for me. You are not allowed in.”
He bared his teeth at her. Erin didn’t step back.
“And you would stop me?”
“I would.”
Brunkr laughed. He looked around. At least twenty Gnolls were standing on the hill, all of them muscled, all bigger than Erin.
“And what will you do, outnumbered and weak as you are, Human girl?”
Erin stared at Brunkr, and shook her head.
“Nothing much. I guess I’ll just tell you something. Something very important that you should know.”
“Oh? And what is that?”
“My name is Erin Solstice. This is my inn. And. You. Are. Trespassing.”
Erin clenched her fist, thumb over knuckles just like Calruz had taught her. She punched Brunkr in the stomach as hard as she could. He blinked down at her and smirked.
He was still smirking when Erin’s leg came up.
“[Power Strike]!”
She kicked him in the groin and the Gnoll’s eyes rolled up in his head. He clutched at his groin and toppled over. Erin looked around at the other Gnolls.
“Well? What are you waiting for? Bring it!”
The Gnolls looked at each other. They stared at their fallen comrade, at Erin, and then at the inn. They howled, and charged.
