“I can see why it’s created a gang.”
“Me too. The problem is, where might we find said gang?”
“Around back? They’re new. They’ve gotta hang around their boss. Or we wait for one of the [Alchemists] to pay up. Bet you they get money every day too. Amateurs.”
The [Nightstalker] rolled her eyes. The [Enforcer] silently agreed. And as luck would have it, they found the very group they were looking for. Not behind Quelm’s shop, but a street over. The group was, as befitted their nature, idling with intent in an alleyway.
They were clearly ready for something; both the [Enforcer] and [Nightstalker] could sense it. A group of sixteen rough men and women glanced up sharply as the trio strolled into the alleyway. They didn’t notice the [Blackguard]. The Brother tipped his hat to them cheerfully.
“Hello sirs and madams. Might I trouble you all for a bit of time? The pair of us have a few questions as it were.”
“Who’s asking?”
One of the biggest men, a [Thug], clearly, strolled out of the group. He had muscle, but a beer belly to go along with it. And he was drunk. The [Enforcer] smelled it on the man’s breath. He resisted the urge to wrinkle his nose and politely tipped his hat.
“G’day, sir. I’m just here by serendipity. And this here’s an acquaintance of mind. One of Chell’s girls. You know Chell?”
The words were innocuous. But they were carefully phrased. In Invrisil or any other city to the north, they would have attracted any group’s attention and respect, regardless of whether they were common street trash or…in the same line of business.
Unfortunately, Celum was just that far removed. Not a light flickered in the heavyset [Thug]’s face or the rest of the group’s faces, but a shrewish [Thief] skulking around the back of the group looked up suddenly in alarm. He opened his mouth, but the [Thug] just scowled.
“Never heard of her. Piss off.”
The [Enforcer] signed. The [Nightstalker] frowned dangerously. The [Thief] who’d recognized their signals on the other hand pushed forwards nervously.
“Betram, listen. Those two are—”
“Shut up, Yapper. You. Clear off. We’re busy.”
The [Thug] pointed at the [Enforcer]’s chest. He eyed the [Nightstalker] and grinned.
“You’re free to stay, though. In fact, why don’t you leave this idiot and stay with us for a while, Miss?”
“Not interested, you ugly piece of crap. We’re not here to play games. Listen to your friend or we’ll get impatient.”
The Sister of Chell glared at the [Thug]. His face went red as some of his group laughed. His hand moved faster than the [Thief] trying to pull him back and whisper. He reached for the [Nightstalker] with an open slap. And his hand was knocked aside by the [Enforcer]’s.
“Excuse me, sir.”
The Brother politely blocked the [Thug]’s path, moving the hand out of the way. Lucky for the man too; the [Blackguard] would have stopped it far less kindly. But the action only enraged the [Thug]. He knocked back the [Thief].
“Betram, don’t! They’re—”
“Shut up, Yapper! You want to die, you bastard?”
He shoved the [Enforcer]. The man was braced, so the blow didn’t knock him back like the [Thug] had intended, but it did make him stumble. And that made his cap slip slightly, revealing some brown hair. The man caught the hat before it slid off his head. And when he looked up, the [Thug] hesitated as he raised a fist.
The Sister of Chell and [Blackguard] saw the [Enforcer] slowly adjusting his hat. The [Nightstalker] looked at her companion and made a rapid call. She tsked, shook her head at her bodyguard, and stepped past the [Enforcer].
“I’ll handle this. Move back.”
