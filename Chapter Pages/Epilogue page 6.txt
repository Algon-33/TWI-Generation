But Erin was sure…sure she had not just been sleeping. Fetohep of Khelt had known her. Pisces told her he’d heard her horn.
Yet it was all a haze. The memories—too many memories—jumbled in Erin’s mind, and she couldn’t hold onto them. The experiences of a ghost tried to make sense to the living girl, and she began crying.
She had friends. They had been there. She knew it. But the names and faces escaped her. The stories…everything she had been through.
It was too much for one mortal mind. Erin sobbed as she lay in bed. She was so weak.
Her eyes fluttered after she wept, and exhaustion dragged her down. Erin heard a familiar voice as she slept. She supposed being dead really did mean you didn’t hear it. But now…
 
[Magical Innkeeper Level 46!]
[Skill…
 
Then a long, long pause. As if something that wasn’t quite sentient, wasn’t quite…alive, but still had methods and ways, a system, was taking its time and figuring something out.
Then Erin heard an uncertain voice.
 
[Queen of Undeath Level 6!]
[Skill – Command Undead: Lesser obt—
<Khelta, [Queen of the Eternal Necrocracy]> [Not found. Canceling.]
[Sage’s Apprentice Level 2!]

<Yderigrisel, Dragon> [Not found. Canceling.]
<Xarkouth, Dragon> [Not found. Canceling.]
<Rhiveile Zessoprical, Wyrm> [Not found. Canceling.]
 
On and on it went. Trying to award her…
 
[Rebel Level 11!]
<Elucina, [Hero of String]> [Not found. Canceling.]
 
Erin listened, trying to hold onto the names. Listening to the classes fading out. Only a few tried to stick to her.
 
[Slaver Class obtained!]
[Slaver Leve—
[Level Ups Cancelled.]
 
[Servant of Nerrhavia Class Obtained!]
[Serv—
[Level Ups Cancelled]
 
And then…and then the voice in her head was silent again. As if mulling over things it could not explain. But Erin knew why…and the voice, seemingly put out by all the mysteries, gave up and went back to the start.
 
[Witch Class Obtained!]
[Conditions Met: Witch → Witch of Second Chances Class!]
[Witch of Second Chances Level 12!]
[Skill – School: Witchcraft (Undetermined) obtained!]
[Skill – Basic Brewing obtained!]
[Spell—
 
She was still crying. Erin didn’t push away the levels. She longed for all of them, except the—the bad ones. She would have been any of them.
The [Queen], the [Hero], a [Sage], a [Rebel]…she would have taken each and every class, even [Pickpocket] like…like who had shown her?
She owed it to them. To those glorious souls. She would have been a [Necromancer] if she could remember what they had told her and given her. But all she had was one class from some intelligent women with hats who knew enough to teach her how to be what they were instead of giving her something.
It almost sounded like the voice in her head knew it too. The apologetic tone listed off the Skills and spells as Erin sobbed into the quiet room. Then it tremulously added one more thing.
 
…[Magical Innkeeper Level 46!]
[Skill – Immunity: Crossbow Bolts obtained!]
 
Erin Solstice lay there, and she would have traded everything for just one face. One name. She…
She would never forget them. Never! The [Innkeeper] tried to get up. She had a purpose. She had to…
She had to do more than just things for herself. More than just warn the world or get ready.
They had told her their stories and she could not forget. The [Innkeeper] clenched her fists. She had spit in the face of ___s, or tried to.
“I’ll never forget them! Never! I swore—I swore to break every chain! I promised to tell Pisces—”
