The half-Elf smiled. Everyone turned to Ksmvr and Yvlon. The [Skirmisher] waved one hand helpfully.
“I regret that I did not gain any noticeable level advancement or class. I am a failure—”
“Ksmvr!”
The Antinium paused, looking straight past Ceria and his team to Klbkch. The other Antinium’s arms were folded. After a moment, Ksmvr looked away and nodded to Ceria sadly.
“Oh, very well. I cannot even be a failure. But I have only gained two Skills. One of them is [Surefoot], which is a very practical Skill with little entertainment value.”
“We could make a mud hill and push you down it.”
Relc was grinning as the other adventurers nodded. Ksmvr considered the option.
“I believe my other Skill is more applicable to demonstration.”
“What is it, Ksmvr?”
Ceria hadn’t been able to ask yesterday amid the bigger concern of her freezing everything around her and Yvlon’s new arms. The Antinium took a few steps into the center of the room. He raised his arms—
And back flipped. Erin’s eyes nearly popped out of her head. Ksmvr did a tight, springing backflip, landed, front flipped back, and then flipped to the side.
The Worker’s squat body and rounded back shell was not meant for that kind of aerodynamics. Antinium didn’t…do that! But Ksmvr did. Everyone stared, and then Mrsha broke out into applause. Ksmvr landed on his feet, looking pleased as he smiled.
“[Evasive Flip]. Whee.”
“That’s amazing, Ksmvr!”
“Whoa! Do it again!”
Erin agreed. Ksmvr happily flipped forwards as the crowd watched, then sideways, back—after about ten flips in a row he paused and held out a hand.
“I am growing very sick. I may expel the contents of my stomach. Stand clear.”
After that, everyone turned to Yvlon. The [Armsmistress] smiled.
“I gained a new class. [Armsmistress].”
“Just [Armsmistress]?”
“There may be a few more words in there, Pelico. But just [Armsmistress] for now. I don’t know everything about my class, but I did change my [Crescent Cut] Skill. It’s now [Sword Art: Curve of the Moon].”
Yvlon drew her broken, battered Sword of Weight with one arm to demonstrate. Erin blinked at Yvlon.
“I thought you’d turn your [Crescent Cut] into something that breaks armor. Like your mordhau thing you did on the Crelers. Into…[Ultimate Mordhau]?”
Some of the [Warriors] laughed and Ksmvr made a chuckling-clicking sound. Yvlon smiled.
“You’d think that, but apparently I qualified for a sword art. Which means I’m good enough with a sword to use an actual technique.”
“You can’t change your original Skill into something completely different. A sword art is an indication of ability. This one wouldn’t ever get it, for instance, just a Skill.”
Tekshia poked Walt and the Human glared at her. Keldrass was nodding.
“Sword arts need to be used in combat, at the right time. You have to set them up, not like Skills. They’re powerful, but situational. Drathians are reported to be experts in that field. As are [Martial Artists], [Blademasters], [Sword Dancers]…”
“Relc’s a [Spearmaster]. Hey Relc! Do you know a spear dance, then?”
Everyone looked at Relc. The Drake folded his arms smugly.
“Maybe I do, maybe I don’t.”
“It’s Level 30+ Skills. I know he’s got [Triple Thrust]—that might be the only thing.”
Selys eyed Relc critically. The Drake scowled at her.
“Well, at least I’ve got that! And it works with a spear and in bed—actually, I’ve never tried it in—whoa!”
