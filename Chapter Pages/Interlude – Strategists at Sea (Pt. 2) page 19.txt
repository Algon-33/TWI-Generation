Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)

He grinned that undead grin. The [Depth Captain] heard a muffled laugh. Venaz turned his head away. But the Minotaur was smiling too. Captain Therrium put a hand on his sword.
“I see. In that case—I’ll have to claim the Swords of Serept forever. [First Mate]?”
He raised his Human hand. A Drowned Woman pointed her wand.
“[Dispel Magic].”
Fetohep’s form—wavered. The sand lost its cohesion. It fell to the deck, dissipating. Therrium snorted. Sand instantly began to whip around the chest, and the crew shouted, trying to hold onto it. But the [Depth Captain] only pointed.
“Curses. I’ve seen the sand trick. Hold it down.”
“[Anchor Lash]!”
One of his [Depth Sailors] pointed. A pair of anchors flew and lashed around the chest. The sand stopped lifting it up. Therrium waved the crew onwards as Wil’s heart sank. The [Depth Sailors] grabbed at the chest again. One of them, a half-Shrimp Drowned Man who’d been very hurt by Seborn’s comment, grabbed the handle. Then, puzzled, he looked down.
A hand was grabbing his arm. It was made of sand. And Fetohep’s face rose out of the box and the sand reformed.
“Fool. [The Desiccation of Zeikhal].”
Before Wil’s eyes, the Drowned Man—dried up. He turned into a mummy as the water was sucked from his body. A corpse. And then—his form dried up further. He fell to the ground, turning to dust. Only some yellowed bone remained.
The Drowned Crews stared at the dust. The ones holding the casket let go. It instantly clattered to the deck. Fetohep rose.
“You have earned my wr—”
Captain Therrium rolled his eyes and pointed a wand. The bolt of magic blew apart Fetohep’s head. He turned to his [First Mate].
“Lash the damn chest to the side of my ship. He can’t use the sand trick underwater. We’ll blast it with as many [Dispel Magic] spells as we need to.”
“Aye, Depth Captain! Grab the chest! Use ropes, idiots!”
The [First Mate] shouted. The Drowned Crew moved, throwing grapples. But before they could grab the casket—it shot open, snapping the anchor ropes.
This time a raging whirlwind of sand rose into the air. It engulfed all three ships. Wil shielded his face—but the sand only affected the Drowned Crews. They shouted, stumbling around. And a figure materialized in front of the stunned crew.
“Begin sailing, Kallinad. The sand will rage for ten minutes.”
Fetohep of Khelt’s flaming eyes stared at Wil. The [Lord] saw Captain Lasc jerk. Figures were rising out of the sands, attacking the Drowned Crews. Therrium whirled, hacking them apart with ease, but they kept coming.
“But—”
“Hurry. That Drowned Captain…may be able to combat the lesser elements of my curse. I do not care to waste my time on him. You have your chance. If you lose the chest again, I will recover it.”
The [King] glowered. Wil nodded. He turned.
“Captain Lasc!”
The [Storm Captain] was running for his wheel. The [Sailors] scrambled, cutting loose mooring lines. Captain Therrium saw.
“You were warned! Cut them all down!”
He tried to fight clear of the sands. His crews did likewise. They saw figures moving in the screen of sand. And then—
A table? It crashed into a group of Drowned Sailors. And Captain Therrium saw a group of forty [Storm Sailors]. Inky, and Merrik and Peki in front. The [Strategists] stood at their backs.
“[Unit: Enhanced Strength]. [Unstoppable Advance]. [Arrowguard Formation]…”
Venaz was murmuring Skills. At the same time, the other three [Strategists] were doing the same.
“[Lucky Dodge]. [Keen Blades]. [Ram’s Charge].”
