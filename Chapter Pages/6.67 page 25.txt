“Don’t say it like that. Like he was just a…a…you didn’t know him. He was awful to you, but he was our friend. He was brave.”
Yvlon paused. Then she nodded.
“I’m sorry. You’re right. He didn’t run. But for him, and we might have all died.”
“‘Drakes don’t run’. He could have, but he didn’t. He stood and fought. Of all of us, the Creler feared him the most.”
Pisces murmured. Everyone nodded at that. After a while, Beza’s tears stopped. Palt looked at Yvlon’s arms. He brushed some ash off his clothes.
“You killed it. You’ve all changed.”
None of the Horns replied to that. After a moment, Palt looked ahead. Ksmvr glanced at him.
“What now? Do we continue our battle?”
“No. I’m done.”
Montressa stood up. She looked down at Pisces, then at Ceria. She shook her head.
“I’m done. I don’t know if I can ever forgive you, Pisces. Beatrice—she still hates you. But Palt has his deal. He’ll be hanging around Liscor.”
“The inn’s gone. Maybe Miss Erin will…”
“No. I don’t know what I’m going to do, but I’ll see. If anyone wants to come with me, I might…Palt? Ulinde? Beza?”
The Minotauress didn’t respond at first. Palt glanced back towards Erin.
“I have to stay for a bit, Montressa. Beza?”
“I—what are we going to do?”
“Keep going. Search. Go back? I don’t know, Beza.”
The Minotauress nodded.
“We have to deliver Isceil’s remains to his home.”
Palt and Montressa nodded.
“We’ll do that at least. Ulinde?”
The Selphid was quiet. She rose, her Gnoll body turning to look in the same direction as Palt. But not at Erin. The Selphid hesitated. Then she looked at her team.
“I’m going to quit. I’m going to join the Halfseekers.”
Ceria blinked. Montressa stared at Ulinde.
“What?”
“Ulinde—”
Beza began, but Ulinde stood up.
“Miss Ivirith forgave me. And it’s my dream. They need a [Mage], a dedicated spellcaster. Why not me? I could do it. Moore and Seborn said they’ll consider it. They’re rebuilding their team. If I can—”
She looked at the others, pleadingly. Palt exhaled slowly. His eyes were still on Erin.
“If you want to, go.”
Montressa leaned on her staff. She was just…she looked at Ceria.
“We should talk, before…”
“Another time.”
Ceria stood up. Montressa nodded, looking relieved as the Horns rose with her. Palt hesitated, then he turned. He held out a hand.
“I misjudged you. Forgive me?”
He reached out to Pisces first. The [Necromancer] hesitated, but then he took Palt’s hand. Neither Beza nor Montressa did the same. Ulinde was already approaching the Halfseekers.
“I’m sorry.”
The Centaur shook Ceria’s hand. She nodded, looking again at Montressa. Beza’s horned head was in her hands. Silently, Ceria got up.
“What do we do now, Montressa?”
Beza whispered. Montressa just wiped at her eyes and watched as the Horns of Hammerad walked away. Palt blew a cloud of smoke that eddied into the air.

The baseball game was underway, and Octavia was smiling as she greeted the hooded shape that hopped out of the gate and made a beeline for her. Numbtongue and the [Alchemist] sat together and watched the game.
On the baseball pitch, Grimalkin was thinking over the logistics of baseball and the merits of the game. He casually caught a ball shooting at his face with a bare claw. And the spectators groaned.
Two on base, one out. The audience was filled. But they were not all together. Some of the Antinium had come out of the Hive and Yellow Splatters was organizing a team of Painted Soldiers and Workers. Bird was curled up into a sulking ball as Anand, Belgrade, and Pawn tried to cheer him up. He glanced up as the Horns passed by him.
