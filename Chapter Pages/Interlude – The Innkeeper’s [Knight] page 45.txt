Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 45
 
“Hells…[General].”
The Bear turned. The [Knight] was looking at him. Dizzy, the [General] whirled. The third impact was the loudest.
Ser Solstice’s helmet deformed. But it was the Bear-General who stumbled back. He shook his head—brought it down with a roar. And he stumbled away.
Then he raised his fists. The [Knight] stepped in. He punched the huge man in the chest, swung, locked arms, was knocked back. But he kept coming.
Yerzhen took a punch to the jaw. He roared and clubbed Rabbiteater along the head. The [Knight] staggered—
And took the uppercut on the jaw. He stood there, poleaxed.

“My brave friend. My [Champion].”
Erin stood there. The world had become just a few feet around her and Zel. The [General] nodded.
“Listen. If you’re a [Champion], you’re a [Champion]. If you’re a [Knight], you’re a [Knight]. Who said they know what being a [Knight] is? They’re Human. Perspectives differ. I’ve seen cowardly, poor [Knights] and the bravest [Warriors] and everything else.”
He was kneeling. Erin grabbed his shoulder.
“Who cares if you don’t have a [Lord]? You can be my [Knight].”
Rabbiteater looked up at her.
“Even now? Even after everything?”
She looked at him.
“Because you left? Nothing will ever change. You might not be fancy. You’re a Goblin. So what? You’re my [Knight]. My [Champion]. I’ll never let you be anything less. And I’ll never abandon you. No matter how far you go.”

“Dead gods. Is your skull mithril or something?”
Yerzhen panted. The [Knight] shook his head. This time—the [General]’s face caught a fist. He swung—ducked.
A hit to the belly that made the man nearly spew. Kick—the [Knight] spun.

“Stop holding back! You’re fighting like a [Knight]! Fight like a Goblin! Cut loose!”
The [General] was howling in his ear. Erin in the other. Stand. He had to—

The Knight of Solstice rose. He howled again. Yerzhen felt a flash of unease. He jabbed—
The Goblin jumped and kicked him in the chin. A roar from the [Soldiers]. Yerzhen stumbled. He screamed. The [Soldiers] groaned. The [General] had just been kicked between the legs!
“Bastard!”
A hammer’s blow from above. The heaviest hit so far. The [Knight] fell.

“You have to come back! You can’t fall down! Get up! Get up!”
She dragged him to his feet with the [General].

“What the—”
The [Knight] rose before he’d even dropped. And his fist—
Yerzhen stumbled back. He raised his guard—
Another blow rocked him back. Then another. The [Knight] punched. One! Two! The fist went under the man’s arms, hit the chin.
Again! He drew a fist back and hit the man in the chest. Keep going! It all felt—was he sitting in the inn?
He pivoted around a desperate fist. The counter put the [General] on the ground. Rabbiteater waited for him to rise. He saw the Bear of Ailendamus roar and charge.
I never should have made you think you had to protect my inn.
Erin whispered in his ears. Rabbiteater charged at the [General]. He kicked the man as he charged, knocking him down. The Hobgoblin leapt on Yerzhen’s chest. Hit him—he was knocked backwards as the [General] threw him off.
Stand and fight.
Zel Shivertail lifted him up. Yerzhen stared up as the [Knight]’s fists flashed in the light.
One. Two. Six. Ten—the [Soldiers] were rushing forwards. The [General] was rocking back on his feet, carried over by the blows. Rabbiteater swayed.
The Bear of Ailendamus fell onto his back. In the silence, Rabbiteater saw the frozen [Soldiers], staring up at the deformed helmet. They backed away.
“Good enough. And good job, Rabbiteater. Straighten your back.”
