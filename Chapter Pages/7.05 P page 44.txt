It would last a few blows in battle. The [Shaman] had other tricks too. She pointed at Raidpear.
“When Humans attack, come. I make you bigger.”
“Doesn’t help.”
Ulvama hit him with the bowl. Raidpear grinned.
“Larger. [Berserk]. You will be very angry. Grow bigger.”
“Like Tremborag?”
Leafarmor blinked. She was very impressed. Ulvama shrugged.
“Smaller than Tremborag. It works best on one. A group gets only bit bigger. You don’t die, even when all the blood is gone. Won’t stop fighting or notice wounds. Then—the magic goes away. You die. Fall over, dead.”
Raidpear internalized the news silently. He nodded.
“Good. Give to me. I fight Troll.”
He looked at Leafarmor. She shrugged.
“I find [Emperor].”
Pebblesnatch didn’t like it. She didn’t like how they talked. When the Humans attacked. When. It was such a certainty, even though the [Emperor] had promised. But Ulvama laughed at his promises.
“When. When it happens…”
She trailed off.
“Some Goblins run. Maybe live.”
“Humans see all.”
Ulvama busily brushed paint over Leafarmor’s face.
“Maybe. I will cast [Camouflage]. Stupid little Cave Goblins don’t need to fight.”
Pebblesnatch glared. But she said nothing. Finished, Ulvama nodded. She’d done the sigils in red and black. They stood out on the Redfangs, but not too much. It looked much like their traditional war paint.
“Garen knew [Shaman]. Redfang paint like [Shaman] paint. But different.”
The Redfangs nodded. Ulvama looked at Pebblesnatch.
“Little Goblin runs away. Tomorrow—before Humans attack. I will give names.”
The Goblins looked up. Ulvama scowled.
“Proper names. So you have a name. And when you die, other Goblins remember you. Through memory.”
The three Goblins stared at Ulvama. She shook her head.
“That’s why you need proper names. Idiots. Hold still.”

The Humans were moving on the borders of the Goblin territory. Pebblesnatch saw them. The other Redfangs were armed, covered in their symbolic paint when the three Hobs emerged. They moved to the border. Out of bow-range. To see what the enemy was doing.
They saw…an army there. But not the army they expected. Ulvama, Raidpear, and Leafarmor blinked. There were many Humans there, some with bows who raised them as the Goblins appeared. But no one shot. And the Humans with bows and weapons and armor were one thing.
But there were hundreds, no, thousands of Humans busy at work. They were shouting, grabbing nails, wood, even building a crane-thing! Some had stone, and the rest were making…
A wall. Yes. A wall. It was already hundreds of feet long—well, the foundations were being dug in some places while the Humans had managed to put up actual wood and stone in others. The wall was ten feet tall at its highest. And it was facing the Goblins.
“What?”
The Goblins stared. What was going on? Most of the Humans were helping with the wall. Almost all had weapons, or grabbed for hammers when they saw the Goblins, but they kept working. They were making a wall.
“Don’t need a wall. Could kill us all.”
Leafarmor pointed out. The Humans outnumbered the Goblins by so many! But they were building a wall. Because…
It took the Goblins a long time to figure it out, but they picked up on the distant voices. The Humans were building a wall because they weren’t allowed to kill the Goblins. Their [Emperor] forbade it, but in the name of safety from evil Goblin [Thieves]—of which there had in fact, only ever been one—they were building a huge wall that would encircle the entire Goblin territory.
