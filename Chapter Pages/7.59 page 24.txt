Dame Truvia would have sent some with the others, but there was no time. She lifted her sword. Calling to the ranks of Izril’s warriors.
“Advance at a trot.”
They did. Lances lowered. [Knights] secured visors, lifted shields. The Guild of Assassins once again wavered. This was an open field. This was not how they fought.
“Canter!”
The bellow made the horses pick up speed. Truvia felt her heartbeat roaring in her ears.
“Gallop! [Knights] of Izril! Honor your vows this day!”
The Faces snarled. The [Assassins] began to break up, trying to circle, draw the [Knights] into terrain that favored them. Their quarry was getting away.
“Charge! Charge, for the Five Families and the honor of Izril!”
What a glorious sight. The rank of steel met shadows. The first [Assassins] were obliterated by the charge. Taken to pieces by lances, blades—their weapons and poison failing on armor. Truvia laughed. She spun her sword up.

Ferin beheaded her. The mithril loop took off the [Knight]’s head. It snapped—and cut through enchanted armor. Three other [Knights] went down. A Knight of the Clairei Fields ran into his wires at full tilt and the Skill-enhanced threads tore him to pieces.
“Kill them all!”
The [Trapmaster Assassin] had lost his temper. He threw the deadly wires, dragging another [Knight] off the horse.
Minotaur-form. Mire brought one down, ignoring the blow to her chest. The [Blademaster] had brought down two in combat. Lightning boomed.
The Faces punched through the line of [Knights]. Enough. They had nearly slain Magnolia Reinhart! They had humbled Tyrion Veltras. The Ranks died.
“Secure our backs.”
The throwing expert unleashed a barrage of projectiles that fouled the [Knights] as they tried to return the charge. Sir Kerrig, bellowing, restored order.
Eight Faces and thirty Ranks burst past the [Knights]. The rest were dead or fighting, holding off the armored warriors.

Still, they ran. They were approaching the two thirds mark of their journey. But look how much they had sacrificed to get there. And—a third left?
Too far. Too far. The [Knights] of Izril had failed to slow the Faces. Forgetting, perhaps, that unlike lesser monsters, [Assassins] had tools that went through their vaunted plate armor.
Forget them. Look at them.
The Wind Runner, desperate, her feet in shreds but for the healing potion she was forced to apply.
Lady Maviola El, galloping, burning at the end of a century of time.
He…tried to stop it. He was caught off-guard by the emotions. The sudden welling of feeling. But he couldn’t help it.
They were being aided by everyone who could raise their hand. Everyone who cared.
Pryde Ulta stopped one of the Faces. Seven left. She had barely caught up to them, running a horse to death with her house’s guard. She—like Bethal Walchaís—had begun to intervene the instant they had heard Maviola’s cry.
Magnolia Reinhart’s circle. The [Lady] pointed and squashed an [Assassin] over a thousand feet away.
“[Extended Aura: Gravity Well]. A powerful [Lady].”
He identified the Skill. Pryde was too slow to catch the others. Her guard pursued the immobilized [Assassin]. Made short work of them.
They were all trying. Once again, the feelings welled up.
The [Stitch Witch] watched as Az’kerash, the Necromancer of Terandria, watched Ryoka Griffin and Maviola El’s flight. There was passion there. She was old, but he was barely more than twice Maviola’s age.
He remembered. He—had been cut of the same cloth as they. Had he not defied armies to become the Undying Shield of Calanfer? Had he not—?
“Master? Is something wrong?”
