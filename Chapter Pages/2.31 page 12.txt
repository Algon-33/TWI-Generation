“I told her that I loved this game. I enjoy playing chess. But I cannot lead armies. I have a [Tactician] class, but…I have stopped leveling.”
Erin blinked. Pawn nodded at her.
“It is problematic. Yet I have no desire to carry out another occupation. I cannot go back to being a Worker, but not even my Queen knows what we are now.”
He spread his hands, knocking over pieces on the board. Pawn jerked in surprise, and then clumsily reached for the pieces. But he abandoned them and looked at Erin.
“I am lost. If I am not a Worker, what am I?”
“I don’t know. Pawn—”
He shook his head.
“My Queen did not know. You do not know. No one knows. Not even us.”
He stared at Erin, and she felt helpless. Pawn’s expression didn’t change, but it couldn’t, not really. He had no nose or skin or even tear ducts. But his mandibles clicked together softly, and his hands clenched on the table.
“We are all lost. But I am the first, and so they look to me. And I—”
Pawn glanced up at Erin, and then away.
“I do not know.”
“Pawn. It’s not something you can figure out right away. Stuff like this is complex. It takes time.”
Erin reached out to touch Pawn’s hand, but he knocked hers away. He stared at Erin, trembling slightly.
“I asked them to go to you that night. I gathered the Workers and told them to fight. And die.”
Erin felt a hole open up in her stomach. Pawn stared into her eyes, his multi-faceted ones direct, full of hidden emotion.
“I asked them to go. They did it willingly, but I was the one who suggested it, who told them to do it. Not my Queen, not Ksmvr or Klbkch. I, and no other.”
She remembered. Erin’s eyes were stinging, but she made herself look at Pawn.
“They saved me, Pawn.”
He nodded.
“Yes, and it was necessary! It was good! But—but what happens next?”
“What?”
Erin didn’t understand. Pawn looked at her, as if willing her to.
“They died to save you. It was well. But what will become of those dead? When Bird, Garry, Belgrade and Anand and I die, who will remember the fallen? They lived. Magnus, Rook, Calabrian, Vladimir, Emmanuel…they lived. But only we remember. Only we care.”
Erin stared at Pawn. This was beyond her. So far beyond her. But Pawn had come to her for help. Only, what help could she give? What advice could she give someone on a road no one had walked before?
“I don’t know, Pawn. I’m sorry.”
The Antinium sat in his chair, shivering. No. Not shivering. Erin looked at him more closely.
He was…twitching. Shaking. It was just like when Erin had first asked him his name, only more violent now.
“What wIll we dO, EriN? wHAt wILL We bEcOme?”
His voice—Erin felt a cold chill run down her back, but she refused to move back. She looked at Pawn. He stared back.
“whAt ArE wE?”
A faint sound made Erin look away from Pawn. Olesm, Ceria, and Zevara hadn’t noticed his behavior, but Halrac had. He was holding something in his left hand. A dagger.
Erin looked at him and shook her head slightly. He stared at Pawn, his face grim, and his eyes flicked to her. She stared into his eyes. Just stared.
Slowly, Halrac sheathed his blade. Erin turned back to Pawn. He was still shaking. She put a hand on his shoulder.
“Hey. Hey, listen to me. You’re not alone. There are others like you.”
“nONe aRe LIke Me.”
It was true. But not true. Something stirred in Erin’s memory. She looked at Pawn. The first of his kind, the leader of a people who no one trusted, who were unimportant. Who didn’t know…
Memory flickered in Erin’s mind. Not recent memory, but stories. Fragments of something she’d heard long ago, in a quiet place as a child.
