Solstice (Pt. 9)

Ryoka focused on the place around her. They were in a vast room. With a ceiling. She noted that. Then the giant fresco on the walls. The…armory…of weapons…
As she grew used to the new world and the disorientation faded, Ryoka more clearly focused on what Ivolethe was tossing carelessly around.
“Must be buried…stupid trash!”
She hurled a bowl of glowing waters to the side. It joined what might have been a relic of ancient magic…currently lying smashed on the ground.
“I-Ivolethe?”
“What?”
“Where are we?”
The fae shrugged.
“Where we need to be.”
It wasn’t Teriarch’s hoard. But it was second-best to that. Ryoka stared at the sigil on the wall. She recognized it. She went dead white. But Ivolethe was reaching down.
“Aha! A cure for a half-dead c—”

And there he was. Aaron felt something was happening. Something…momentous.
Wistram Academy was practically shaking as mages ran about, shouting. They felt it too.
But he felt, no, he knew he was at the center of something just as great. His finger wavered.
All he had to do was…he looked around.
“Do it.”
Emerrhain stood in front of him, over the intensely complex magical circle. Not even Nailihuaile and Feor combined could have copied it. But it was…familiar. Aaron’s finger wavered.
“I don’t know if I should. I don’t—I don’t—”
I don’t want to. But he didn’t even think that. Emerrhain sighed.
“This is the answer to all you wish to know. You will know so much after this, Aaron. I cannot help you if you do not help me. What I want, you want. What you want, I want.”
His eyes. Aaron tried to look away. He tried to put down the iPhone.
It sat in the center of the circle. Aaron’s finger jerked. But it was lowering. He looked up. Emerrhain’s eyes were focused on the glowing screen. Desperate.

They were screaming. The first of the fae poured through the gateway after them. Things were dying. But the five remained. And yet he came.
Oberon!

The ritual was failing. Othius thrust forwards a hand, trying to tear the gap apart himself. Nereshal hurtled forwards and knocked him down, dragging him back as the Blighted King fought and kicked.

“Aha! There!”
Ivolethe had found something in the pile of relics. Ryoka saw…a scroll. It was so gentle and warm she laughed to see it. Ivolethe swore, her fingers touching the thing.
“It is strong. I cannot pick it up as I am. Ryoka—”
The Wind Runner bent…

Aaron sighed. His sweating stopped. He looked at Emerrhain.
“Did I ever have a choice?”
The scholar had his hand on Aaron’s. He smiled, with gentle compassion.
“No.”
He pushed Aaron’s finger down onto the glowing button.

Ryoka Griffin stopped. Her hand was almost on the scroll. But she felt it. Ivolethe felt it. She cried out.
 
“No! No, no!”
 
The Wind Runner did not know what had happened. But Ivolethe was—screaming. She screamed towards the sky—and Ryoka felt it.

Laken Godart saw the vengeful fae halt. The five figures turned. They stopped cowering. Stopped fleeing.
At the tiny sound. It filled the world. Interrupted the wondrous sounds of spring. The raging battle. It was just a small sound, but it did not fit. Not in this world.
It was artificial.
Ding.
Slowly, so slowly, Laken Godart reached into his pocket. Across the world—

The Drake recoiled as the device, which had been out of power, lit up. She fled backwards—then saw something on the screen which stopped her heart for a second. She collapsed.

Cara O’Sullivan picked up the glowing iPhone with trembling fingers.
“Aaron?”
She turned it. And saw one thing.
