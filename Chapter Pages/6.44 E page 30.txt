“Night is the worst time to hunt a [Witch]. She can use illusions or summon spirits if there are any about. Raim is also exhausted. We wait for dawn. Is that a problem?”
“…No. Act as you deem most fit, Huntress Erashelle. But are you certain you can both locate and trap Belavierr tomorrow?”
The [Witch Hunters] paused. The man with the hammer nodded.
“She’s wounded. She can attempt to flee, but we have her location. While we are on the hunt, even her speed will fail her. She cannot escape Sylind’s Skill.”
Sylind nodded. She was checking her bow.
“I can feel her. Not six miles distant.”
“Six miles? We could ride against her now—!”
Talia shut up as Ser Raim looked at her.
“Unless a [Hunter] leads, she could outrun you, Dame Talia. Again, it will not be easy. I must gather my strength. So long as I burn, her magic fails around me. The [Hunters] will end it if I cannot and support me. We will work alone. As a team. You must guard our rest.”
“I understand. Forgive me, Ser Raim. Leave the field to us. We are armed and Riverfarm supports us.”
Dame Talia’s cheeks were red. She looked questioningly at Durene. The half-Troll girl nodded.
“I’ll help. Beniar and his [Riders] are taking out anything that gets past you. Except for those giant things, we can beat all those undead.”
“She’s weakening already. Those first legions were ancient. Now she’s summoning undead. Still, if we hadn’t had Raim burning half of them away she might have overwhelmed us just with those.”
One of the [Hunters] murmured. The others nodded. Everyone stopped and glanced up. Ryoka felt a thump. Talia strode towards the window. She swore and charged out the door. Ryoka saw a huge shape in the darkness. Then a bloom of fire. Durene barreled out the door as well. Rie paled.
“What is that?”
The [Hunter] with the crossbows glanced up. He took a step towards the door and Sylind stopped him.
“Tagil. Save your bolts. The Order of Seasons has it.”
He nodded and sat back down. Tagil answered brusquely, placing one crossbow on the table and checking the enchanted weapon piece by piece.
“Undead. She’s sewn together Flesh Abominations and raised Ghouls. She may send a Rotfield Giant against you. Be prepared. Belavierr has more creations still.”
Rie paled. But Prost just nodded. He looked warily towards the windows.
“The magic she’s throwing against you all. Will it truly not get in?”
“Hostile magic fails in this place. Even Ser Raim’s fire is hard to use here. This is a place for [Hunters]. We know our craft, Steward. Raim. You won’t be able to rest here. We’ll guard Sylind.”
Tagil addressed Raim. The [Knight] looked up wearily. The Knight-Commander spoke briskly.
“Indeed. Two [Summer Knights] will guard your rest. Dame Talia—”
“—has gone to join the battle. I will leave her to it.”
Ser Raim stood, wearily. Calirn’s voice snapped.
“Absolutely not. Fall Sentinel, contact Talia. Have her return at once. Ser Raim—”
The [Knight] ignored the Knight-Commander. He wearily walked towards the door. Ryoka opened it. She held out an arm.
“Here. I’ve got you. Where do you need to go?”
“My house. And who—who are you?”
Rie murmured. Ser Raim paused. He stared at Ryoka. Then he nodded.
“Directions would be welcome, Miss Runner.”
He did not lean on her. And he ignored his Knight-Commander as he wearily walked outside. Ryoka stepped warily away from the house. In the distance, more fire bloomed, and [Knights] rode to battle. But Ser Raim walked away from it, into Riverfarm. Ryoka was braced. She didn’t know if Belavierr would assail them. If she did—Ryoka was ready. But nothing attacked them.
