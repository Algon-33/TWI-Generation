The [Thief] froze. The self-bereaved wife let him go and he backed up into a corner and tried to squeeze into the stone. The wife looked around with a very lost expression. She was a young woman. Barely eighteen. She must have just been married, or else married young. She was attractive, but she was a mess; she’d been crying when the Horns were brought in. Ceria caught her eye.
“Thank you.”
The murderess looked back at the half-Elf, looking lost.
“He looked nice.”
“He is.”
“Good. Good. I’m…I mean it. I’ll kill him if he so much as squeaks.”
She pointed back at the [Thief]. The man’s face was white as he shook his head frantically. Ceria’s skin crawled; that was another thing about prisons. Sometimes the [Guards] separated by cells, but sometimes they didn’t think someone was a threat and you spent a night sleeplessly watching the other people in the cell. They’d underestimated this girl.
“That’s…quite alright. Thank you, though. But he can stay alive unless he speaks.”
The young woman nodded.
“Okay. I’ll remember that. And him. But I don’t mind it. I don’t have any other reason. I killed him, you know. Myself. I leveled up from it. I’m all red now. It’s so red up here…”
She tapped her skull. Her eyes dripped tears. Ceria found herself backing up unconsciously. She licked her lips.
“I’m sorry to hear it.”
“I did level up.”
Pisces moved forwards. He gave the woman a charming smile and a slight bow.
“And we are grateful. Truly. You look quite tired, Miss. We’ll leave you to your rest. I’m sure it’s been a long day.”
“It has. Thank you.”
The woman retreated. So did Pisces and Ceria. They backed up until the woman was somewhat out of view. Ceria breathed out. Then she turned to Pisces and Yvlon. She wanted to say something, but aware the others might still be listening with Skills, she just looked at Yvlon.
“Alright. Want to talk about it?”
The woman had watched the exchange silently. Yvlon looked up. Her face was shadowed in the dark prison with only a few lanterns providing light.
“No. But we should. I know I shouldn’t have taken the bait. But—”
“I was angry too. But you’re just feeding into what they think, Yvlon. You know what it’s like. Tomorrow we’ll grab Stan and Alais. Kick some sense into them if we have to. If we can find Olesm, the Halfseekers even, get someone to vouch for us…”
Yvlon was nodding. She looked up.
“Thanks. I’m sorry.”
Pisces sniffed and then clearly regretted it.
“This isn’t the first night I’ve spent in a cell. Although perhaps one of the only full nights I will spend in one. We could slip out, but alas, I’m an adventurer now. I suppose I can tolerate this.”
Yvlon’s lips quirked the slightest bit.
“Thanks, Pisces. I didn’t mean it. I’ll control myself. It’s just—”
Her voice broke. Ceria saw her shoulder shake. In the darkness, she finally made out Yvlon’s face. It was running with tears.
The half-Elf looked at Pisces. He’d frozen. So she knelt and grabbed Yvlon.
“Hey now. It’s not true.”
“But I did lose my team. I did. We lost them. Sometimes I forget their names. Their faces. I don’t dream about them anymore, Ceria. I ran, just like—”
Ceria sat on the ground and grabbed her friend. She rocked back and forth with Yvlon as tears and memory both filled her again. Her eyes stung. She whispered.
“It wasn’t like that. We did all we could. It wasn’t like that. We tried…”
