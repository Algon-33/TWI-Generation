Up. And she did not deserve to be there. She had not been there. Numbtongue growled. He would not have her defiling Erin’s resting place. Never mind that she was a Goblin and had not known her. He was in no mood to be reasonable.
He stood, stumbling a bit as his frozen muscles complained. Ulvama halted a second—then hurried left.
“Stop.”
Numbtongue stumbled after her. But a figure blocked his way.
A white Gnoll. He snarled at Mrsha. She flinched—but a bee buzzed past Numbtongue’s face warningly. He swatted at Apista.
“Out of the way!”
He was going to—
A sound crossed the garden. A menacing sound, so rare here.
Thump thump slap. Thump thump slap.
Numbtongue’s head turned. He stared.
Beaver gang. The Fortress Beavers marched up the hill, slapping their tails. He raised his sword, but couldn’t swing it—they bowled him over. The weakened, hungry [Bard] rolled—
And they sat on him. Mrsha patted Numbtongue’s head and showed him a card. He stared at it.
“What?”
Ulvama was heading up the hill. Towards the frozen bier, and the young woman.
She stopped when she saw Erin Solstice.
“Ah.”
That was all. The [Shaman] saw the crossbow bolts, the blood; it did not take a genius to see what had happened. She looked at the faint smile and shook her head.
For a moment she bowed her head. And if Numbtongue had feared she’d be disrespectful…Ulvama bent and felt the permanent cold, eying the runes of power, the altar of gifts.
“Good place to chill drinks.”
She commented to Mrsha. The Gnoll gave her a warning look. The Hobgoblin shrugged. She felt little sadness. A bit, but—
“She is not dead.”
She patted Mrsha on the head. The little Gnoll looked up at Ulvama, longingly, hoping it to be true. Ulvama bent, studying the young woman. And at last, she nodded.
“Yes. I see it now. She is the one. Why it feels safe here.”
[Natural Ally: Goblins].
No killing Goblins.
It had begun here. With a young woman, long before the fire. With an inn. Mrsha’s eyes filled with tears. She wanted to go to Erin and hug her. But it was so cold. And the fire…
Ulvama studied Erin Solstice. Then, slowly, the [Shaman] bent down. She halted at the magical barrier. Then, reached past it.
She touched Erin’s hand. Just—touched. Numbtongue made a sound. He knocked the beavers off him, struggled up the hill. Ulvama closed her eyes. She held up her claw as he shouted, lifting his sword.
And she was holding the fire.
Numbtongue stopped, sword in hand. He stared at the burning flame, in Ulvama’s palm. Mrsha’s eyes opened wide.
It was tiny at first, a spark, nothing more. But it grew, dancing, as Ulvama focused on it. The [Shaman] bit her lip as the flame grew. Then she held it out.
“There.”
She looked at Mrsha. Numbtongue swayed, incredulous. Uncomprehending.
“How?”
The [Shaman] looked at him. She smiled. And the flame grew as she handed it down. To Mrsha. To Numbtongue, who clasped at it, his eyes wide.
It burned in the gaze of the beavers. Over the frozen young woman.
The Worker, who had to come to say farewell, fell to his knees. Rose, Selys, and Ishkr all halted.
Look at it. There it burned. That beautiful flame, made of so many at once. It changed as Numbtongue and Mrsha held it.
Hope. It burned like brilliant blue. In Ulvama’s claws it was different.
Kindness. Which was red like a rose, crossed with gentle orange. Soft and marvelous.
“How?”
That was all the [Bard] asked. He held it, the last gift he had thought lost. Hope. He looked at Ulvama. She smiled, and this is what she said.
“Silly Goblin. When the fire goes away, you light it again.”
The flame grew.
