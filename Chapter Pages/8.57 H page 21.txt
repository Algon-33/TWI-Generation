“Ah, it was just a thought! It might help some of the others sleep at night. I was just curious.”
Merr stood up abruptly. She turned, laughed as she stretched, then reached over to clap him on the shoulder.
“I’m heading out. You keep scrubbing. Eugh.”
She wiped her hand on her shoulder. Pisces started, then smiled. He looked at Merr. They held each other’s gazes too long, and then she walked out into the cooling world outside.
Pisces sat there for a while. Like a single drop of color in a bucket of water…he wondered if that was what Merr had truly come here to ask. He almost wished he knew that spell—
But no. That was too close to Riqre.
Riqre and…Pisces remembered his dreams. Roshal. They had nearly come. He sat there in silence; for how long, he couldn’t have said. Probably only minutes.
Then someone entered. Pisces blinked as someone shuffled into the tent.
“Merr said it was empty—Merr!”
A distant laugh. The Lizardwoman shook her fist, then stared at Pisces. At least she had a towel—two towels. She sighed.
“Hey.”
“Ah…hello.”
Eloque hesitated. Then she sat down on the vacated stool.
“Just so you know, I’m not scrubbing myself here. I’ll find another tent.”
“Perfectly reasonable. I would vacate, but…”
Eloque eyed Pisces working on one arm.
“Dead gods, you’re like me and my stitches. How can someone be so dirty?”
“I’m not that—”
Pisces gave up. Eloque half-rose, then sighed.
“There’s lines for the steam baths. I’ll join a queue. Merr didn’t bother you too much, did she?”
“Not really. It was actually a convivial talk—that is—enjoyable.”
Eloque nodded. Her lips moved. She adjusted the towels, making sure they weren’t slipping.
“She’s tough. Did she ask you about memory spells?”
Pisces stopped brushing at his skin. He looked up.
“Yes. I don’t have any.”
“I told her you didn’t, but she wanted to ask. Not that I think it’s…good. It’s too much like them. Like Roshal.”
Pisces nodded slowly. The Lizardwoman turned her head. She extended an arm.
“How do I look?”
He stared at bright scales, glowing in the faint light from the steam generator. Clean scales. They had faint marks, but the thread was gone. It ran up to Eloque’s shoulder…and then…
Everywhere. The Lizardwoman saw Pisces’ gaze and turned. This time he did turn away.
“It’s a work in progress.”
“It looks—better. I can’t tell from just the arm, truly.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Eloque nod. She sat there in silence for a moment.
“It would help if they could forget. If everyone could. You know, someone got stabbed yesterday?”
Pisces glanced up.
“One of the [Bandits]…?”
That was one of his fears and why he hadn’t trusted Merr. He still trusted her; not necessarily the others. Eloque shook her head.
“No. It was one of the freed—one of us. We have those big tents, and she must have rolled over or someone else did. She woke up when they were partly on top of her and she stabbed—well, it was a Stitch-woman, so it wasn’t bad.”
“Oh.”
“Yes. Like that.”
It was Roshal. Roshal…the encounter had brought it back. They were running. Not just free. Pisces sat there. Thirty undead weren’t enough. He tensed—and Eloque looked at him.
“We’ll make it. Or we won’t. Either way, we won’t go back.”
“No. I will get you to the coast. To…Izril. If the others don’t want to find their own way. But I have promised it, Eloque. And I have allies.”
He looked up and met her gaze. The Lizardwoman tilted her head.
“You know, I believe it. I saw that carpet go down…that was the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in my life. I actually think, some days, that we might escape. But you know something?”
“What?”
