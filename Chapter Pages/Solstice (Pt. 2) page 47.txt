Solstice (Pt. 2)
Page 47
She saw, in that fragment of reality, countless visions. Her mind recoiled from understanding. She was screaming, falling, flying—
And then she landed. Forgetting the aeon she had spent in between almost as she touched the ground.
Part of her never would forget. Never could. And yet—Ryoka’s breath left her. She hit the ground with a thud.
It didn’t hurt. She felt strange. Strange in her body. Strange in her skin.
Strange in the air. The world around her was changed. Ryoka felt it in the breaths she took. She scrambled upwards.
And there she was. In the world of the fae. She stood on a vast hilltop. And behind her were standing stones. An ancient construction of stone amid grass.
Forming a gate. It shone behind her. Ryoka looked around and saw more hilltops.
Hundreds.
Thousands.
Beyond millions.
And on this hill, flowers of every shape and size. A profusion without end. Ryoka inhaled their fragrance. Her eyes hurt so much to see them all at once she closed them.
Tears ran down her face, and she did not know why. The sky—the land! She looked around.
The land of the fae. The sun shone brightly here, high overhead. Ryoka looked around. She breathed. Or thought she breathed. She touched at the grass, wondrously. Then she called out.
It had been so long. Her voice trembled in the air.
“Ivolethe?”
She strained her ears to hear. But there was nothing and no one on this hill. Just the grass, the stones, and the blooms. Ryoka’s tears ran down her cheeks, from exhaustion, from relief, uncertainty and sorrow and reasons she did not yet know.
Then the wind blew from far away. It came countless leagues. Tugging at her sleeves, gently touching her cheeks. Blowing her tears away. And Ryoka heard it at last.
Her friend’s voice.
“Ryoka.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: The last chapter will be the end of Volume 7 if all goes according to plan. But I don’t know if it will be on Tuesday, next update. If it appears, all well and good.
If not? I’ll be working on it. Making sure it has everything. There is so much—and yet it will be done! Just be warned.
One more chapter. Or two. I dunno, things can go wrong. But you can feel it too.
And entire year’s worth of writing has gone into Volume 7. I am tired. I will be taking two week’s break at least after the end of Volume 7. I need two weeks, at least. My only desire is to make this as good as it needs to be! But we will see next chapter.
For today, I’ll leave you with that and some art. Thank you for reading.
One more chapter. Or two.
 
Today’s artist has the most fitting art. Dr.Replig8r, and…well, scary stuff. Even Gazi. Much love to them for the art!
