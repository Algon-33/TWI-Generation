The spear went into her stomach. Alevica realized that after she screamed. She stared at the sword on the ground. The man raised his spear. It was bloody. Her blood. Alevica screamed as she felt the burning again. Desperately, she reached for a potion. Drank it.
It did nothing. Something was burning her insides. Poison. The [Witch] stared up as the man casually kicked her blade away.
“Poor luck, Miss Witch. You should have hit me with that bolt somewhere it mattered.”
He lifted the spear, and then reconsidered.
“[Witches] cast curses with their dying breath. Or so the textbooks say. I can’t risk one now. Curse me and I’ll finish you off. Otherwise—you can hope someone finds you.”
He walked away. Alevica tried to shout after him. Swear that if he didn’t give her the antidote, she would curse him. But all she could do was scream.
The pain was burning. The poison—Alevica realized she was bleeding. Dying. The Witch Runner whispered. Magic. She had to call on her magic.
“Poison bites and tears away. But—but life, hold and stay! Blood, thicken and stop! Stop! Call help and give aid! Before this [Witch]’s life fades—”
She tried to pour her magic into the spell. But she couldn’t focus. She was slowing the bleeding. But she couldn’t pour energy into a working. Alevica lay there, clutching at her stomach. The poison was eating her up. The blood…trickled…away…
It was hot. Alevica screamed for help. And then her voice gave out. She lay there, the world fading. Her magic fading. Until she heard galloping hooves and an urgent voice.
“She’s here! She’s here! Ryoka! She’s hurt!”
Alevica heard someone racing towards her. She felt something huge kneel. A huge body. Not a Human’s. As hard to read as that man. Alevica couldn’t do non-Humans well—
“Alevica! It’s me!”
Charlay? The Centauress grabbed Alevica. Then she saw the blood.
“You need a potion! Ryoka! Ryoka!”
“I’m here! I—”
Someone. Blurry shapes. Alevica looked up. She felt a cool hand on her. Babbling voices.
“—stabbed her. Help me get—”
“Who? Nearby?”
“—matter. Potion?”
“No.”
Alevica could groan the words. She spoke, desperately.
“No potion. Poison.”
“Poison?”
The two voices babbled. And then someone picked Alevica up. She screamed and cursed, but the hands pushed her up. And then someone was holding her as she was bounced. And each bounce took more blood away. Someone was babbling at her to stay away. Stay awake—
“Emperor Laken’s close by, Alevica. Close enough for him to locate you when you didn’t come back. Hold on. We’ll get you to Riverfarm. Charlay, run. She’s not going to make it—”
“I’m trying. Just hold her! [Lightning Gallop]—”
“Eloise. Eloise.”
Alevica begged. She didn’t know what was happening anymore. Someone was slapping her. And then she was flying. Flying and falling. Into the darkness. Until she felt the power, and the [Witch] who held it.

“She’s dying. She’s lost too much blood. The potions don’t work with the poison in her. She needs a transfusion—”
Ryoka was babbling. She was still trying to apply pressure. Eloise stared down at Alevica’s pale face, the tinge of green in the wound.
“She will not die. My coven, hold Alevica here while I work. I’m familiar with poisons as well as teas and herbs. I can counter it. Give me a moment.”
The old [Witch] spread her herbs on the table next to Alevica. The [Witch] was so pale and still. Even the blood had stopped oozing. But maybe that was because of the [Witches] who stood around her.
