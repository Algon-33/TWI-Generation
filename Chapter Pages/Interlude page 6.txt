Klbkch stared coldly at Lyonette. He looked across the Painted Soldiers, living and dead.
“This is why the Antinium exist. Why Soldiers exist. To fight and die. How should I speak of them?”
“With compassion.”
The young woman met the Revalantor’s eyes. Klbkch hesitated. Then he shook his head.
“What good would that do?”
Lyonette opened her mouth, but Klbkch was already turning. He bent down and inspected Yellow Splatter’s body.
“Slain by a spell.”
“He died protecting me.”
Pawn whispered. Lyonette hugged him. Klbkch looked back at Pawn.
“Yellow Splatters was unique. His talents were commendable. Belgrade.”
“Yes, Revalantor Klbkch?”
The Worker shot to panicked attention. Klbkch pointed at Yellow Splatter’s body.
“Recover his remains. Bring them to the Hive. I will petition the Queen to perform the Rite of Anastases on his corpse. Yellow Splatters may be revived.”
“What?”
Lyonette stared at Klbkch, uncomprehending. But the other Workers looked up. So did the Soldiers. They stared at Klbkch. The Revalantor nodded coolly.
“The odds of success are low. Yellow Splatters may not have the levels to be resurrected. I suspect he does, but we will see. It may even be possible to give him a more fitting body. Perhaps a voice. The Queen will—”
“No.”
The word was quiet. It came from Pawn. The [Acolyte] looked up. He did not weep. The look in his eyes silenced even Klbkch for a moment. The Revalantor turned to face him.
“Explain yourself, Pawn.”
“No. You won’t revive him.”
Pawn moved forwards to stand between Klbkch and Yellow Splatters. He spread his good arms, protecting the fallen [Sergeant]. Pawn stared at Klbkch, and at the other Antinium.
“He’s in a better place. Why would you want to bring him back?”
“He is needed.”
Klbkch’s mandibles closed together, a tad uncertainly. Pawn shook his head.
“He’s free. Leave him be.”
He faced down Klbkch. The Revalantor wavered, then he turned.
“Decide as you will. But be swift. He must be brought to the Hive soon or any chance of resurrecting him will be gone. I must go.”
“Where?”
Lyonette was incredulous. She stared around the battlefield. At the dead. They littered the ground. So many that she felt sick. But Klbkch walked past and over the dead as if they were invisible to him. The horse whickered as Klbkch mounted it. The [Guardsman] and Revalantor looked down at Lyonette.
“I have my duties.”
He wheeled the horse southwards. Lyonette watched him begin to canter down the hill. Pawn turned.
“And that’s it? They died and that is all you’ll say?”
Klbkch didn’t turn. Pawn shouted at his back.
“What was the point? Why was it only us? What was this for?”
His voice broke. He fell to his knees. Lyonette bent as the other Antinium surrounded him.
“Pawn. Pawn, it’s going to be okay.”
Lies. Pawn looked up and Lyonette blinked back tears.
“She’s alive, Pawn. You saved Erin. You did save her.”
“It’s not enough.”
The Worker whispered. The Antinium shifted restlessly. But Pawn paid no mind. He looked back at the dead as Lyonette tried and failed to haul him to his feet.
“What can I do? What can I say? To the others?”
He gave the other Painted Soldiers an agonized look. They stared down at their brethren, silent. Unreadable. But not emotionless. Lyonette looked at the silent Antinium. She brushed tears from her eyes. Didn’t they know? She raised her voice and the Antinium looked at her.
“They were heroes. Obviously! Tell them that!”
Pawn looked at her.
“Heroes?”
“Yes. What else could they be? Tell them that. They were heroes. And you’ll never forget them.”
