However, I’ll write a chapter for Tuesday…then I might have to take 1 update off because I’m getting my vaccine in the middle of that chapter and it might wipe me out.
I will let you know. However, I hope you like this more-scattered, less-prepared chapter. I’ll take a bit to recombobulate after so much effort with the Horns.
But as you can see…you won’t wait long. Oh—and I’ll try to get that Patreon poll up on the 4th so you can vote if I take that chapter off to vaccine-rest…which isn’t rest. So much to do! I’m going to rest and eat, but hope you enjoy! Thanks for reading.
