“Perhaps something less direct, Elirr? I think Liscor’s citizens would prefer something with some…what’s the word? Ornamentation. What’d they write last year?”
Lism waved a claw.
“The new Council has assumed its role as leadership of Liscor, etc. etc…copy that and have someone shout it a few times.”
“Wait, but wouldn’t that be lazy?”
It was Zalaiss who raised her claw timidly. Lism’s eyes popped.
“Who cares if it is? And who cares what the Council has to say?”
“Well…”
She looked uncomfortable and glanced around. Jeiss was rubbing at one ear. Alonna shrugged. The Gnolls looked blank. They didn’t see the point either. Lism drawled.
“Next? Or do we vote on it? This isn’t important.”
“On that we agree.”
Krshia folded her arms. Helplessly, Zalaiss fell silent. Olesm went down the list. It would have taken the old Council ages to come up with a worded message. Wasn’t it important? Then he hesitated. Wait, who would listen to the announcement anyways? Not many people. How many would remember it was the same as the last one? He looked at his uncle. Lism had never had time for superfluous work.
“Another issue is when the Council meets.”
Raekea nodded. The [Armorer] was looking more reassured now the old Council was gone. This she could understand.
“Meeting times? What’s the tradition?”
“Once a week on a day chosen by the Council, unless a member convenes the Council due to an emergency or a situation of crisis demands meetings at more regular intervals.”
The Gnoll paused. She frowned.
“Once a week?”
There was a snort from Lism.
“That’s not work. That’s a vacation!“
Krshia nodded.
“Let’s do three days a week at least. Try for five. That would work for me.”
Jeiss groaned. Lism looked at him, but the Senior Guardsman only held up a claw.
“Dawn? It’s the only time that would work for me. I want to see my family nights. I’ll change my schedule with the Watch.”
Lism nodded. Alonna yawned.
“Works for me. This isn’t far from the Guild anyways.”
“All in favor?”
“Er, do you mean right at dawn or…”
Zalaiss trailed off as the other five Council members stared at her. Lism blinked slowly.
“We do have to work, you know. Dawn’s simple. I’m up before it every day.”
Krshia nodded.
“As am I.”
Raekea raised a paw.
“Me too.”
“Sometimes I work through the night. On patrols. Dawn would actually give me a chance to get regular patrol times.”
“I can get up early.”
“My cats wake me up.”
Tismel didn’t say anything. He meekly raised his hand as the Council voted unanimously again. Olesm found himself crossing out item after item on the list. Meeting times? Check. Contact information? They would be here at these times. Just hire a Street Runner! Redecoration? Lism’s glare made Olesm’s quill cross that off the list, never mind the nutty carpet.
“Any more trivial decisions or can we debate the real issues? I see four. Or something. Antinium, walls, Minotaur, funding. Close enough.”
Lism looked around the table. He was met only with silence except from a slow stare from Krshia. Raekea sat up and Elirr leaned forwards. Jeiss took a deep breath and Alonna cricked her neck, looking at Lism. He nodded.
“Alright. Let’s get down to the real issue. All in favor of executing the Minotaur? Let’s get this done.”
“Lism!”
Krshia snapped. Lism just looked at her.
“What? You know we’re all thinking it. That’s what I ran on. Let’s just see a show of claws!”
“You can’t just use a majority vote!”
“That’s how it works.”
“Wait, who are we voting to…execute? The Minotaur? You mean, the one in the dungeon?”
Tismel looked queasy. Jeiss frowned and then raised his hand. Alonna held up hers.
