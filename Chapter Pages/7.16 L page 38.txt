“I came back because it was interesting. Hello. Ooh, Klbkch looks bad. That is good. Probably.”
Bird waved around. He froze when he saw the Flying Antinium and a group of Antinium ran into him.
“Are those wings?”
They were there. All of them. They looked at Xrn. She spread her arms.
“We have come. Hope, Klbkch! Hope, you fool! Believe.”
And he did. He was no longer alone. The broken, tired, despairing Antinium lowered his head. And he wept, in ways only she could ever know. Xrn knelt by him. And the Free Queen wept too.
They were whole again.

That night was filled with many things. But—among them. Was this.
Watch Captain Zevara, listening, fearing…had a visitor in her Watch office. It was past the hour any sane person should be awake. Into dawn, really. But he knew she’d be there.
She flinched at the sight of Klbkch. But he wasn’t…that broken. He’d taken more injuries, but someone had healed him with both potion and [Heal Minor Wounds]. And the Antinium looked…
“Watch Captain Zevara.”
“Klbkch. I—have to say. Despite Relc starting it…”
Zevara struggled for words. Klbkch beat her to it.
“I am taking a leave, Watch Captain.”
“Huh?”
The Antinium carefully put his badge on the desk. He saluted. And he seemed happier than Zevara had ever known. He was smiling.
“I am taking a break. I believe I have a decade’s worth of time off saved up. For a week or two. Perhaps longer. It is for my rest and recuperation. Will you grant it?”
Zevara looked at him. She looked for her jaw. At the badge. Eventually, she nodded.
“Um. Granted.”

That was all. Klbkch had so much to say. To do. More smacks to receive. But—look.
“So this is your barracks. I remember when it was small. But I had to leave. I will not leave so easily again. The Hives will have to come here. But we may travel. There is need for the Painted Antinium. Fighting—growth. We are connected. The tunnel is complete.”
Xrn was turning, inspecting the Hive. Pawn and the other Antinium stared at her. The Centenium was so…different. Anand peeked at her from over Belgrade’s shoulder. The Small Queen exclaimed as she looked around.
“So much to see. And do! I must meet this Erin Solstice in truth again. And what is this?”
She looked at Chesacre and Thaina, and they stared in awe at the female Centenium. The…definitely female Centenium. Without question. She’d smack you with her staff if you objected. Xrn’s eyes shone as she looked at them.
Happy to see them. To see them something new. Rejoicing in it. And Pawn—believed. He believed in her. In the future.
That was all. What more could you ask for? Perhaps only this. For the future—Anand sidled up to Xrn. He hesitated. But you had to try.
“Excuse me, Xrn. But…may I…call you my aunt?”
The Small Queen stared at him. Surprised. And then she smiled.
“Yes. Of course. And what would you like me to call you?”
She looked at Anand. And then—she felt something from Klbkch. The Small Queen resolved to smack him again, and he flinched. But she reached out.
And she hugged Anand.
 
Author’s Note:
Do you feel betrayed by a lack of…horrible tragedy? Perhaps the unrealistic thing about this chapter is the good things.
I wrote a lot. This is all I had left. I’m so tired. But this is fitting for the break. And now—I rest. For 2 updates. Shorter than I need, but I’ll appraise my condition, take another break in May, or sooner if I need to.
And I’m happy to write. Just—the body is weak. The spirit stronger. But both a lot weaker than Klbkch, let’s be real.
