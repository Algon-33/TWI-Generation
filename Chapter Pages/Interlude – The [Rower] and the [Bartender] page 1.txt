Interlude – The [Rower] and the [Bartender]
Page 1
He wasn’t old enough to walk.
 
Something—whispered to him. Shadows tried to obscure the light. Give it all to us. Abandon this vessel.
No. The [Rower] moved. He flailed his arms. If he died here—
 
I will never hear him speak.
 
He began to climb. No—swim. How long he had drifted in oblivion, he did not know. But as he began to struggle, this otherness began to recede.
Cold liquid surrounded him. Suddenly, he did need to breathe. He felt water, pressing in, terrifying in the actual darkness, but reassuring because it was real.
Still, the shadows tried to pull him back. Luan swam upwards, lungs bursting. Light. He needed…
His world began to deteriorate again. Not because of the nothingness, but because of the real lack of oxygen. Luan realized he was deep underwater.
Deep. So far that while there was now the hint of light, it was so far above. Hundreds of feet. And he had no air.
He began to choke, swimming with all the strength in his arms. Bubbles passed him, but his limbs were leaden. An Olympian. The only one from Earth—but what use was that kind of ability without air?
Air. So sweet. Luan kicked his legs and couldn’t bear the pressure in him anymore. He opened his mouth.
Saltwater entered his lungs. He began to choke. At the same time, his ascent was making him dizzy. Nauseous. He was—
Flicker.
His consciousness shut off for a second. He had seconds left. He forced himself up another dozen feet. And then began to drown.
No. Not like this. Not—
His desperate flailing had no sense anymore. He’d lost track of direction. Luan’s last thoughts were that he was letting the golden light down.
And then he heard a real voice in the darkness. Louder than the whispers. Louder than his fading thoughts. It whispered to him.
“You are dying.”
This was so. The man couldn’t respond even if he wanted to. But suddenly—he inhaled. And thought resumed.
Yet his lungs were still filled with water. He flailed, but something…soothed him. The voice, not quite words, continued. And he realized it was a single message.
“You are dying. Accept salvation from the sea.”
He realized something was on his face. Circling his throat. Piercing his skin—but the pain was a lesser thing.
“Join us. Breathe the depths.”
The [Rower] felt something moving across his face. Half his body. Something had—found him—as he was drowning.
He knew what this was. The last gift to the drowning [Sailor]. The choice presented to the lucky at sea, or made voluntarily.
The Gift of the Drowned Folk.
Something was on his face, his throat, acting as gills. Some…creature…was trying to meld with him. Turning him into one of the Drowned Folk.
Half man, half sea creature.
Luan looked up towards the light. So far away. He began moving his arms and legs again as sense returned to his oxygen-deprived mind. He swam upwards—but the voice grew insistent.
Don’t move. He was causing the other distress and they had to be one thing.
Luan kept moving, ignoring the instinct to remain still. He felt pain. A shock as something suffered.
Stop! 
If the connection failed, both would die. Luan would drown, certainly. Yet—the man kept moving. He felt the water in his lungs turning to death again. What was he doing?
Didn’t he want to live?
The answer was yes. Yes, of course. But Luan kept swimming. He would have accepted any help rather than die. But a thought kept pressing at his head. Even now—the gold spoke to him.
Nandi. And my son. I never got to hear him speak.
“Stay. Live. Breathe the depths.”
I want to. I want to live. But if I do—he will never know my face. Will he even recognize me?
