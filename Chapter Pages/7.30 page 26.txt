Erin knelt over a pile of dust, searching for Toren. Calling his name. 
She held Headscratcher, trying to hear his last words.
Klbkch was dead.
Scenes flickered through the fire. Not any one thing. Maviola brushed at her eyes.
“You’ve seen too much.”
“Maybe. But you—”
“I’m old. I should have sadness enough for a lifetime. But you? You’re a girl. You shouldn’t be able to call so many memories out. That’s why I’m here.”
Maviola reached out and touched Erin’s hand. Erin jerked, but it was too late. Maviola touched the fire—both blinked—

The Worker walked towards Erin. She raised the frying pan and he stopped. The Worker raised all four arms.
“Please. I mean you no harm.”
The words were familiar. The way of speaking was familiar. Erin hesitated. She stared at him. She knew him. But she asked anyways.
“…Pawn?”
“I am not Pawn.”
The Worker shook his head. But he was not Ksmvr either. He knelt before Erin suddenly, and she nearly tossed the jar of acid. But the Worker made no move. He spoke to her, voice loud in the silence. And she knew his name before he spoke it.
“I am Knight.”
Erin stopped. And walked out of herself. She stared around as time froze.
“What’s happening?”
Her voice was a ghost in the memory as she saw herself staring at [Knight]. Someone else appeared.
“I don’t know. This has never happened before. We’re in your memory.”
Maviola stared around. She reached for Knight. Touched at the Antinium.
“What is this?”
Erin knew.
“An [Immortal Moment].”
She stared around. The two Skills had merged. Erin would never forget this moment. And in her fire was the memory. Maviola touched at her chest.
“It hurts. I feel—you.”
Erin’s panic, her confusion and fear. Erin felt it too. But she had lived it. For Maviola—her eyes glittered. She clenched her teeth.
“Where…is it?”
She looked around. And both of them saw.
A figure crawling up a hill. Crimson eyes made of ruby. Pure terror. 
Erin’s heart clenched, but she refused to retreat. Maviola turned pale and backed away.
“Dead gods. What is that?”
“Skinner.”
The past resumed. More Antinium stepped forwards. Naming themselves.
Milner-Barry. Garry. Bird. Calabrian. So many—and Erin had never forgotten them. Maviola walked among them. Erin was in two places, recreating the memory and watching as well, a spectator.
“Look at them. They are nothing like the Antinium I know.”
Erin blinked. The Antinium were gone. The fire flickered. In the private room, the fire changed to red. The two women’s hands were linked. Erin felt—
Rage. Maviola stood with Fulviolo, Petra and Ulva Terland, Lord Dallien Veltras—only Wellfar had refused to send aid to House Reinhart.
And there was Magnolia Reinhart. A girl. But she rode, garbed in armor and protective equipment at the head of an army.
The Antinium surrounded Liscor. Maviola spat. Erin felt the bile in her mouth.
“What vile things. We were right to come, Fulviolo.”
“The Drakes are not our allies.”
Petra snapped. But the other house heads were equally disturbed by the vast horde. The Black Tide was reforming. Fulviolo hesitated. Maviola looked up at her older brother and he, his face lined but no less the brother she had known, nodded.
“Allies or not. This army threatens all of Izril. House Reinhart was right. We cannot allow this plague to continue. Lord Dallien. Will you lead the charge?”
The [Lord] of the Veltras family nodded.
“Ride with me, Fulviolo.”
“It would be my honor. Maviola—”
“I’m coming with you.”
The [Lady] insisted. Fulviolo pulled her aside.
