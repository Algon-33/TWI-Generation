Interlude – Meetings and Friendships

As she wove with her threads, the Stitch Witch saw the desperate, bright emotion. She took it, and the fear from the skeleton and wove it into her magic. She smiled.
Waiting. The Spider wove her web, waiting for her catch.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: Five more days. Five more chapters. And The Last Tide is only two days away. Once again, I wrote the first part longer than I intended. And it’s also a long chapter. I’ll write shorter ones! And be more experimental. But these fast chapters give me time to write, well, points of view that have been a long time coming but haven’t fit into the chapters so far.
Are you enjoying them? It’s still hot! Hope you enjoyed this chapter. Look forwards to one tomorrow! And the day after that…and the day after that…and then nothing more for the month! Is it better? Hm. Well, let me know what you think!
Thanks for reading!
