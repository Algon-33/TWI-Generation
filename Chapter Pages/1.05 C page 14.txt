I grab his arm. He stabs me, but I don’t let go. I draw him closer as he stabs, looking for my heart.
“You’re a fool. People laugh at you. You make them laugh. But I? I’m a clown. I laugh at the world.”
He stares at me. My free hand reaches out. I grin.
“And guess what I just found?”
His eyes widen. I pull the fireball out of the air, out of the space he kept it in. He tries to back away—
And there’s fire.

The Fool’s body lies on the ground, blackened. One of his eyelids is burnt away, exposing an eye. His right hand—gone. The rest of his body is destroyed.
But he is still alive. I walk towards him and pick him up in my arms. I don’t feel my body anymore.
“That’s funny. Are you…crying, Tom?”
He looks at me. I stare down at him. Me. The laughing man in my head is gone.
“I guess I am, Fool. I’m sorry. It was me. I did all this.”
“You don’t say?”
We stand alone in a blackened crater in the courtyard. Alone, but for all the witnesses. The Blighted King lies on the ground, breathing heavily. But he is alive. And the rest, the citizens of Rhir who pour through the gates, the battered Drake company led by Cirille, gather. To see a dying Fool, and the clown who killed him. One, a beloved face turned traitor. The other a monster. A hero.
“I’m so sorry, Fool. I don’t know what I would have done. But—I couldn’t let you. I knew that.”
“I suppose not. You’re not a funny fellow, Tom. Not funny. But you don’t want to be, I think. But do you know what’s funny?”
His voice is hoarse. A whisper. No one else can hear him. I have to put my ear to his lips.
“What? What is it?”
“The Blighted King. Why do you think I turned on him? It was the day after the ritual that I knew. When you were summoned, I learned the cost.”
“What cost?”
“Crimson.”
“What?”
“They wear it. Crimson for the lost. Miscarriages, they said. A curse. But it wasn’t. And the price was—high.”
I raise my head. Standing in a group across from me are the ladies of the Blighted King’s court. Lady Zekyria stares at me, her face pale. Her gown is torn and scorched. But light red, closer to pink, and white.
For her dead child.
“Yes.”
The Fool’s whisper is pitiful. He looks up at me, pain in his eyes.
“Ten thousand unborn souls. For you sixty. Isn’t that—that—”
His remaining eyelid flickers. His other eye strays before snapping back on me. He’s dying.
“A funny joke, Tom. A terrible joke.”
“But it’s over, Fool. It’s over and done.”
“No.”
The Fool reaches up. His hand—flakes away at the touch. But he looks me in the eye.
“A hundred thousand. He wants an army this time. An army. He’d sacrifice so many for any edge. And if a hundred thousand doesn’t work, he’ll sacrifice a million. Every unborn child, to kill Demons. To kill people just like you and me.”
I stare at him. Of course. I can’t be surprised. It makes sense, in the horrible way of this world. I’m almost…numb? But the Fool cares. He cares so much, and the pain in his eyes—he whispers his last words to me.
“I cannot stop him. I couldn’t end it. Or save her. But you can. Protect her. Take her away.”
I look up and see Erille. She stares at me. Me, the man who killed her beloved Fool. He grasps my arm.
“Please. I wished—”
I wait for the rest. It never comes. The Fool’s hand grips my arm, tight, stiff. He doesn’t let go. Even in death.

The foolish clown sits in the broken courtyard as the people gather on the balconies, flood through the gates. Royals, knights and mages and dignitaries, common folk and people from another world. He weeps, holding the body of the Fool in his hands.
