And then they ran. They charged up the hill. First Redscar, passing Erin in a breeze of fur and laughter. Spiderslicer, cursing, hot on his heels. Noears, whooping with excitement. Poisonbite, scowling and smiling. Hobs Erin recognized. Cave Goblins. They joined her. And Reiss looked up at the Human and saw the army. The Goblins shouted as they raised their weapons. They stood around Erin, looking up at her, forming a wall in front of her.
The Flooded Waters tribe with their pikes in front. Archers behind. Redfangs to the left. Cave Goblins to the right. How many? They were probably only a third of Reiss’ army. But they held their ground. Then they advanced.
“What’s going on?”
Laken looked around as the confused shouting grew louder. He stood up and Gamel tried to explain.
“I don’t believe it.”
Zevara stood on the walls. Klbkch gaped, his mandibles parted, as below, the Workers and Queens began to panic. Pawn stood up and ran. He ran to Yellow Splatters and the waiting Painted soldiers.
“It’s her. Please, you have to help her.”
Yellow Splatters stared at Pawn in confusion. But the other Soldiers looked up. There could be only one her.
“Am I dreaming? Who is she? It has to be her! Who is she?”
Niers was laughing and crying. He stood up as his students stood, dumbfounded. Venaz stared at his teacher.
“What are they doing? They’re all Goblins.”
“No. They’re not.”
Umina shook her head. She turned.
“Professor, what happens now?”
“We have to go after her! Let go of me!”
Ceria struggled in Moore’s grip. The adventurers were lined up on the walls. Halrac lifted his bow uncertainly.
“It’s suicide! We can’t!”
Revi was pale. She pointed with a shaking finger down at Erin.
“She’s insane. She can’t be doing this!”
“But she is.”
Seborn stared down at the distant figure. She was surrounded by Goblins. But they were moving. All of them. They were moving away from Liscor. Towards the Goblin Lord’s army.
“Impossible.”
Lord Tyrion stated the word flatly. As if it could change reality. He watched the second Goblin army led by the young woman begin to accelerate. They were running across the Floodplains, and the Goblins were dug in.
“My lord? What do we do?”
Jericha looked up at Tyrion. But he had no answer. He just kept staring.
“Master?”
Reiss stared at his kin. They were coming. All of them. And there was no betrayal this time. No double cross. They were just coming. Against him. He heard a strangled sound in his head.
“Crush them. My apprentice, crush these—these interlopers! Kill that girl! Take Liscor!”
The same words. But without the same authority. The voice in his head was panicking. Reiss, the Goblin Lord stared ahead. He closed his eyes, and then opened them. But that didn’t change things. He saw the Goblins running, shouting, and…laughing. It was an alien sight to him. But he had orders.
A part of Reiss that was real screamed at his real self to stop. But the slave in him, the part that obeyed was in control. So he pointed, a puppet dancing on the strings.
“Charge! Kill them all!”
His Goblins looked at Reiss. Charge? They hesitated. Some began to advance. Eater of Spears shouted a challenge and Snapjaw raised her sword. But there was no momentum. Reiss’ army froze as the Goblins of the Flooded Waters tribe, the Redfang Goblins, the Cave Goblins—
No. The Goblins of Liscor. The Goblins who followed the Human girl running with them. The Goblins who shared one thing in common. An inn. What would they call themselves, this new tribe? This temporary alliance?
