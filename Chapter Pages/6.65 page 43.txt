“They are in position. What is our signal?”
Klbkch didn’t know. He strode for the surface.
“I will send it. Watch Captain Zevara is preparing an assault. Wait for our signal.”
Thirty minutes.

Erin stared as [Mages] surrounded the inn. Olesm was looking at her.
“We’ll go through the walls. Can you—”
“Yes.”
“Erin, I know—”
“I don’t care. What’s taking her so long?”
Zevara was standing close to the doors with Embria. 4th Company was interspersed among the Watch. Waiting. But the Watch Captain hadn’t given them the order to attack. The Crelers were sitting in the inn. Erin thought there were more than before. They might be going through the door until it ran out of mana and then coming in. There were so many. She felt them in her inn.
In her. She felt sick. Ill. But she knew the plan.
“Why is she waiting? The Horns are—”
“Erin. An Adult Creler can kill a Gold-rank team. Gold-ranks can kill them, but depending on the team—the Horns could have fled. But if—”
Erin stopped listening. She ran towards Zevara. Just as Beilmark raced out of the city with someone. Erin’s head turned. She saw adventurers and [Guards] jerk back. She stared as Zevara turned.
“Calruz?”
The Minotaur was in enchanted chains. Zevara nodded at him.
“Calruz.”
“Watch Captain. What’s going on? I heard—”
“What is he doing here?”
A Gnoll growled. Beilmark looked at Calruz with hatred. Zevara ignored them. She reached for her belt. Produced a key. She stepped over and unlocked Calruz’ chains.
“Watch Captain!”
Embria aimed her spear at Calruz’s heart. The Minotaur stared at Zevara.
“Battleaxe.”
The Watch Captain addressed one of her [Guards]. The Drake stared at her. Zevara snapped.
“Battleaxe!”
She seized it and handed it to Calruz. The Minotaur stared at it as his one arm rose slightly. He looked up.
“What are you doing?”
“There are Crelers in that inn. We need to take it to get to the door. The Horns of Hammerad are on the other side. They held the line so others could escape. They may be alive. But we cannot bombard the inn. We’ll bring the walls down, but someone needs to draw the Creler’s first wave. There are thousands in there.”
Erin’s eyes went wide. Embria stared up at Zevara. The others realized what the Watch Captain was saying. Calruz stared at the battleaxe as Zevara held it out to him. The Drake’s arm was beginning to tremble with the effort of holding it level with one hand.
“I see.”
“That’s suicide.”
Erin looked at Calruz. The Minotaur jerked. He turned around to her. He opened his mouth. Then turned his head to the inn.
With his one arm, the Minotaur lifted the axe.
“Did you say the Horns were inside?”
“Yes. Try to flee and I’ll have to kill you. But I won’t force you to go in there. Guards, advance!”
Zevara drew her blade. The Watch moved up the hill. Erin saw Olesm signaling her. But her eyes were on Calruz. The Minotaur looked down at the axe for one second. One [Immortal Moment]. He stared at Erin. And then he turned and surged up the hill.
“Take down your Skill, Erin!”
“[Reinforced Walls]! Off!”
Erin twisted something in her mind. Something crashed in the inn. Calruz strode up to the door. He lifted the axe. And Liscor’s Watch stared up at him.
The Minotaur raised the axe. He met Zevara’s gaze and she saluted him. Calruz turned. Erin Solstice stared into his eyes and he thought she could see his soul.
The Minotaur turned. His foot kicked the door open and the darkness waited. His death moved. And Calruz laughed.
He howled as he charged into the inn, alone. The words came from his heart. His very soul. Unbidden.
“Death before dishonor!”
