“It’s nothing like the iPhone. I will trade them for help. I told you. Ivolethe is alive.”
“I know. Fae do not die easily. She shattered her mortal form. She lives. But the Faerie King is wrothful with her. And his ire is not one you should provoke. Take comfort that your friend lives, Ryoka Griffin. You do not wish to make matters worse? Believe me. Offending the Fae is the surest way to invite calamity.”
She knew it was true. But—Ryoka helplessly gripped at something in her belt pouch. She felt freezing cold, lifted the little statue up. Teriarch focused on Ivolethe’s form. He paused, looking at Ryoka.
“I know. But she’s my friend. My first true friend. I’d do anything to see her again. Even take a [Witch]’s bargain.”
“Do not do that. That busybody is not to be trusted. She always takes more than she gives.”
The Dragon whispered. An old man cautioning a girl. Ryoka knew he was right.
“But…please? Won’t you take anything for this? Anything? One of the things I asked for. A protection artifact for Mrsha. A cure for Fierre. Anything at all?”
She offered the small pile of objects. The Dragon hesitated.
“Would you have me give her a Ring of Greater Health? Or a Necklace of Protection? Would you take a panacea for your Vampire friend? Artifacts of such power I have. But that too is interference. And is what you possess worth that? Are they unique, truly?”
Ryoka’s face fell. She lifted a smartphone, looked at it. The copy of her iPhone hovered in the air. And the Dragon could just—copy the other devices.
Kindly, but sternly, the Dragon flicked a claw at the pile of devices.
“I will offer you a trade, Ryoka Griffin. A small favor for a copy of each. Trinkets. Knowledge. Then we will part again. I cannot solve your woes. I tried to, once. It just made men smaller, petty. That is the flaw of paradise, of Khelt. A Dragon cannot solve anything. I am a Lord of Flame. But not almighty. Close, yes, but…”
Ryoka half-smiled. Teriarch chuckled. Then he looked seriously at her.
“But I cannot fly into Rhir’s hell and live. I cannot dive into the lair of Krakens and hope to emerge unscathed. My people were laid low by mortals. I do not underestimate them.”
The young woman wiped at her eyes. But she wasn’t crying. She’d just expected—everything.
“Okay. Thank you.”
The Dragon seemed vaguely surprised as the fight went out of Ryoka.
“You are satisfied with that?”
She just looked up. And nodded.
“Yeah. I was just—pinning my hopes on an impossible dream. One even a Dragon couldn’t fulfill. That’s classic me. I should have been realistic. I should have stayed at Reizmelt. Fixed my problems myself.”
“There is wisdom in that. We cannot rely on others for everything. Knowing your limitations is also part of wisdom, girl. Some things are unchangeable.”
The Dragon unhelpfully added. Ryoka sat down. She looked at the pile of electronics. And closed her eyes.
“Can you…help me see Ivolethe again? However unwise?”
“I will not quarrel with the fae. But I do know something of their laws. There are…chances. More than that, I cannot offer. Is that your wish, then?”
“Yes. Thank you. Will you help me with Fierre? Mrsha?”
The Dragon hesitated. He pursed his lips and looked at the girl curling up on herself.
“One. I will give you one gift.”
“—Then. Mrsh—Fierre.”
Ryoka closed her eyes. One was safe. The other one was…sick. The Dragon nodded. He closed his eyes. Whispered.
“I think—yes. This may help her.”
A little chest opened. A single vial glowing like starlight flew towards Ryoka. She reached for it.
