The [Bandit Leader] stared around at his group. Then his head snapped up. The woman with the black hat stared at him from horseback. She addressed the pale-faced girl next to her.
“You see, Nanette? A small spell works better than obvious magic. What we see and show is more important. You are not a [Mage]. Remember that.”
“Yes, Miss Califor.”
The girl replied, a touch breathlessly. Jek, the [Bandit Leader], stared at them as the woman nodded.
“Good. Now—ride.”
The two on horseback wavered, and then vanished. Jek and the [Bandits] spun. They saw two distance figures on horseback racing towards Riverfarm in the distance, and only now heard the hoof beats. Jek pointed, trembling with fury.
“Get them!”
The [Bandits] stormed after the pair, those without horses running to catch up. Ahead of them, Miss Califor considered their lead and the approaching village with narrowed eyes. Her apprentice, Nanette, clutched her horse’s reins, white-faced.
“Miss Califor, they’re catching up!”
“Patience, Nanette—a [Witch] is always calm—”
“Miss Califor!”
The [Bandit Leader], Jek, had a Skill. He was riding twice as fast at the two [Witches]. And his bloody axe was raised. Miss Califor turned in her saddle. She eyed Jek balefully, and looked ahead. And up. As he drew level with her, the man raised his axe. And she said only this:
“I warned you.”
Jek hesitated. And that was enough. He looked up and spotted the armored figure riding towards him from the side too late. He turned and swung. And to be fair, he hit the armored rider. But his steel axe bounced off the armor. And the [Cataphract] swung his sword and cut across Jek’s face.
The [Bandits] halted. They saw Beniar ride past Jek, and the man fall. Then they heard the shouts. The Darksky Riders charged, riding down on the [Bandits] with roars of fury. The [Bandits] scattered, screaming.
“The Darksky Riders!”
“That’s right! You bastards thought you could hide this close to Riverfarm!?”
Beniar roared as he galloped after another [Bandit], sword drawn. Nanette, shaking, let her horse slow, and Miss Califor, her lips pursed, regarded the [Bandits] and [Riders].
“What an inconvenience. But it is a lesson. Take note of it, Nanette.”
“Y-yes Miss Califor?”
The girl was pale beneath her hat. She looked at the woman, the [Witch]. Califor shook her head briskly.
“Don’t tremble so, Nanette. We were never in any danger.”
“But what if they’d seen through your illusion? Miss Califor? Or if the adventurers hadn’t caught up—or if—”
“Breathe, Nanette.”
The [Witch] sighed. She adjusted her hat and looked up sternly.
“We were never in any danger. Perhaps we might have been, but a good [Witch] does not show fear. She makes what preparations she may. And—what is my eighth rule, Nanette?”
The girl gulped. She hesitated, and then, as her lips moved, she recalled it.
“She looks up—”
She looked up at last. And then, overhead, she saw her. Alevica, her broom parked high overhead, swooped down. Nanette nearly fell out of her saddle. The younger [Witch] tipped her hat to Califor, and the older [Witch] grudgingly inclined hers an inch.
“Wotcha, Nanette! And Califor! There’s [Bandits] all about today!”
The young woman grinned at the suddenly star-struck Nanette. Califor just sniffed.
“Evidently. Thank you for your assistance, Witch Alevica, although I would have preferred a more helpful approach.”
“You were fine. And that patrol was nearby. I won’t waste more crossbow bolts or potions. Anyways, we’re all fine. Am I late?”
