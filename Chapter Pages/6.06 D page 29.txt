“So, how’re you doing?”
“Good! I’ve been practicing new spells. Marching with the company—it was pretty dull, but hey, the job’s a job, right? And the company’s growing. It’s good to see you.”
Quexa blurted that last bit out. Daly smiled.
“Look at us, standing around. Say, want to go for a walk in the city? We can talk on the way.”
“Sure! I’m just dying for a nali-stick by the way.”
“It’ll be our first stop. My treat.”
“Oh, really? You’re so nice.”
“Well, maybe you can do me a favor in return.”
Quexa gave Daly a sharp look and he elaborated.
“We’re looking for someone who can teach us [Repair]. Know any [Mages] who might be willing to do it for cheap?”
“Oh. Sure! I know a few names. What, are the ones in this city giving you a hard time with your flashy-things? Leave it to me! But tell me—how’ve you been? What have the Bushrangers been doing? Let’s find a cool place to sit and you can tell me about it. Over a few nali-sticks. And some juice?”
“I’d love that. You’ve got the time, right?”
The Lizardgirl smiled.
“Quallet won’t mind. Come on!”
She pulled Daly forwards. He followed her, and saw Quexa turn her head back and paused for a second.
“I’m not having sex with you afterwards, though. Just throwing that out there. Well, not just for a nali-stick…”
For the second time in as many minutes, Daly nearly inhaled his tongue. He stopped, sighed. And then he laughed.

“I didn’t want to interrupt you. But both of them have it bad and they were whining to me the entire way here. They insisted I get you right away.”
Quallet looked as if he were always in a bad mood. But Geneva knew him well enough to know he was genuinely concerned for the two Human men he wanted her to see. For her part, she was fully equipped. Not that her patients needed surgery—they had infections. Bad ones, but Quallet had spared her the details.
Aiko was following Geneva, carrying some of their gear. Geneva paused in front of the tent where her first patient was waiting.
“Where’d they get the infections? Battle?”
“I wish. They got it at the last town we stopped at.”
Geneva frowned, perplexed.
“From what? Cuts? Something they ate? A bug?”
The [Mercenary] looked embarrassed. He shifted from foot to foot, a rare sign of discomfort.
“No. Ah, from a brothel.”
“Oh. So the infection’s…”
“I can tell them you don’t need to see them if—”
“No, it’s fine. I just need to be sure. It is on their genitals?”
Quallet nodded. He flushed a bit. Geneva was calm. She looked at Aiko. The [Nurse] looked distinctly embarrassed. Geneva was a [Doctor] and to her, private parts were all the same when someone was on the table. But Aiko was hesitant.
“You can let me do the diagnosis. I’ll only call you in if I need help.”
The Japanese young woman shook her head vigorously.
“No! I’m your assistant. So I will go with you! It’s just…”
She flushed again. Quallet looked at the both of them.
“I don’t think embarrassment’s going to be the worst of it. I took a look and—”
He shook his head.
“—it’s bad. The worst case of it I’ve seen.”
“Does it have a name?”
Geneva frowned. Quallet shrugged.
“It’s one of the new ones. I think they call it Yellow Rivers. But I didn’t ask too many questions. I’ve kept them isolated like you said I should do, but I wasn’t about to leave them.”
“No. You did the right thing. I’ll handle it from here. If there’s anything I can do—they know I can’t work miracles, right?”
Quallet nodded. But the look he gave her told Geneva that the story of the Last Light was still widely told in his company. She shook her head and took a breath. Not a surgery. But she was still a [Doctor].
