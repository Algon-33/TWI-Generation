Bang. The impact was heavy. Ser Vorn’s horse reared. The [Knight] reeled. What was that? It was heavy—too fast to see. A spell?
“Flora! Stay back! Silvenia—”
The Demon was shouting. He cut left and right, keeping the Lizardfolk away from him. Uxel was attacking again. But another shot rang out—the Gorgon screamed.
Where? Ser Vorn turned his head. He saw her behind a rank of Demons.
A young woman. Human. Not a Demon at all. The [Knight] hesitated until he saw her raise a piece of metal.
That sound again. So loud he heard it over everything else. The [Knight] felt pain.
His shoulder—the bullet had deformed the enchanted metal! He lowered his lance as he kept his shield up. Ser Vorn charged.

Flora saw the [Knight] turn from Bazeth. He rode towards her, breaking past the Demons as his spear stabbed again and again. She felt her breath coming fast.
Reload. She’d practiced it countless times on the shooting range. Spent cartridges fell to the ground. She sighted—pulled the trigger.
Five shots this time. The [Knight] reeled. His horse went down. But his shield blocked the bullets. She hit him in the leg and saw the armor deform—
“Flora, retreat!”
Bazeth was trying to reach her. The [Gunslinger] saw the [Knight] charging on foot. He cut through Demons, his spear abandoned, a sword in hand. She reloaded, raised her revolver.
“[Double Tap].”
Two bullets fired simultaneously with one pull. This time he couldn’t stop it. She heard a sound—his shield fell from deadened fingers. Instead of scrambling for it, he ran towards her. She fired again.
Two rounds left. One missed. He actually dodged it, blurring left. A demon [Soldier] struck at him and the [Knight] slowed a second. Flora pulled the trigger again. Another miss. Again—
She hit him in the helmet. The [Knight] was barely twenty paces away. He stumbled. Flora saw him sag backwards. Then he caught himself. The sword cleaved the Demon’s head in half. She stared at his helmet.
Dented. The [Knight] charged, his sword raised. Flora reached for the fast-loader.
And dropped it. She saw the [Knight] running. She didn’t have another. Flora fumbled for the open cylinder. She whispered.
“[A Bullet A Day: Armor Piercing Round].”
She felt something in her fingers. Flora closed the cylinder. She raised the revolver.
Bang.

Cirille saw Ser Vorn fall. The Drake screamed something. Uxel was howling. The Demon and the Human girl were falling back.
They were dying. Lacten had moved too far in. The [Martial Artist] was fighting in a circle of bodies, alone. He spun, kicked, dodged a flurry of blows—
An arrow struck him in the shoulder. The [Martial Artist] barely slowed as he deflected a thrusting spear. But enough. The Demons ran him through from behind. Lacten kept fighting. He backed up, reaching for a potion.
But there were none left. He vanished. Cirille saw Merish fighting forwards.
“Merish—retreat! [Rapid Retreat]!”
She shouted. The Gnoll howled—but the others dragged him back. The irregulars closed ranks. They were surrounded now. Instead of holding the gates and walls, they held only one section of wall and the gates, forming a rough semicircle.
“Commander—”
“Every archer, I want that Human dead. And that Demon.”
Cirille pointed. The [Archers] loosed, but the Demon’s glaive was cutting down arrows. Cirille heard a scream.
“Bone Behemoth!”
She looked up—and a fist obliterated a group of Gnolls. The undead was attacking.
“Hetarria!”
The [Necromancers] fought with something they couldn’t see. The [Necromancer]-[Captain] was screaming.
“Stop! Damn, you, stop!”
