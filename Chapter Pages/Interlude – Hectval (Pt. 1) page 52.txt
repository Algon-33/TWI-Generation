Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 1)
Page 52
He poured the glowing liquid onto Belgrade’s side. The arrow was buried deep, and the Antinium caught his arm as Kerone went to yank it out.
“It is barbed. My wound is not healing.”
He looked up at Kerone’s terrified face as the Drake shook his head. The Antinium clicked his mandibles. So softly.
“Poison. Of course.”
 
 
 
 
Belgrade, [Strategist]
 
“Familiar.”
That was all he said. It was hot.
He was dying. The poison was trying to kill him, but he was Antinium. He had been engineered to resist poisons.
However, it also stopped him from healing, so in that sense, the poison had done enough.
The arrow had hit him in the guts. Not the chest or head. In that sense, it was a…poor shot. Belgrade was in no position to feel fortunate.
The churning pain in his stomach had already turned into a feverish haze. That was a bad sign. He was lying propped at the top of the hill, as the officers panicked.
“Hold the line. [Deploy Trap: Bear Trap]. I needed more traps.”
He was speaking to Kerone and the others, trying to keep them from running. They would die, running about in the dungeon.
“We’re not in a dungeon, sir. We’re at war in Hectval’s foothills.”
The Drake addressed him. Belgrade’s mandibles opened and closed.
“Did I say that? Similar. You will die uncoordinated, alone. The squads must reform. Form a fighting line. Hold choke points. It is easy. If I die. You do it.”
The Drake paled at the thought.
“We can’t get the squads. They’re lost out there. Belgrade, commander. Don’t die on us. Olesm—Commander Olesm. Someone try to raise him!”
“You will not. They have jammed our spells. We are cut off. Surrounded. A fear-Skill was used. Or spell. That…that is familiar.”
Belgrade could see the fighting from where he was propped up. Someone had tried to compress the arrow to slow the bleeding. The bandage was already green with his blood.
“There. Wipeout.”
Belgrade wanted to point, but his arm was made of lead. He ordered Kerone to save that squad, but the Drake refused.
He knew what to do—but his limbs, his command, were unwilling to listen. Or unable?
They were not Antinium. Olesm had made a mistake. If you could not have your commands obeyed, your level was meaningless.
They were afraid. Which was fair. Everyone was afraid. This—this reminded Belgrade of the past. Yes. The day they had all died.
“You’re alive, sir. Keep awake. Where do we go? What do we do?”
Belgrade’s mandibles clicked together.
“Hm? There…they’re coming up the hill. Just like last time. There’s one of them out there.”
“Who?”
“Skinner.”
A gasp. They knew that name, too. That monster. Belgrade mumbled.
“I was there. I saw him die.”
It felt like he was dozing off. He would say something, then snap back to dreaming. Remembering? The [Strategist] heard something talking.
“The inn? You were at…”
The officers were around him. More or less? Were others listening too? Belgrade nodded. Poor little soldiers, dying out there.
“I was there. Very familiar. There weren’t many of us. Barely a few squads. Workers. Low-level. We fought. Knight. Bishop. Good names. Garry. Bird. Magnus. Belgrade…”
Yes. There he was, standing, fighting with the others. Around an inn with undead swarming at the windows. Leaping ghouls.
“Stand and fight together. Dying. Until the end, until the end, he said. Then I was still there, but they were all dead. I regretted it.”
“You’re alive. You’re still alive. Belgrade…Belgrade…stay with us.”
Someone was shaking him. Belgrade wanted to sleep…and knew he couldn’t.
