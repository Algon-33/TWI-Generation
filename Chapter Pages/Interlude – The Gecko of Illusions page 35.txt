Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

Bearclaw snarled as she dragged herself back to the safe house. She was bleeding. Even after drinking the potions, the enchanted spear had done too much damage to her guts. The Drake had nearly torn it through her midsection.
But she was alive. The gang had splintered, fled after Bearclaw had run, rather than fight the Drake who refused to die. Bearclaw snarled as she reached for the door. It stank. Her blood, the Drake’s blood, death, and gore plus the damned sewer stench—she pushed the door open.
“Soot, you bastard! You tricked me! You never said he was—”
The Gnoll roared inside, weakly. She was going to kill Soot, then run. He had better have the door or the Gnoll. If he’d run—
He was inside. He hadn’t fled. The Drake was sitting where she’d left him. Bearclaw smelled blood. Her blood. It was in her nose, and the stink—she snarled.
“Where’s the Gnoll?”
He didn’t reply. Soot just stared at her. Dull-eyed. Bearclaw snarled as she stalked forwards, into the safe house.
“What happened?”
“Close the door.”
The voice came from Soot. No—from behind him. Bearclaw stiffened. One of the bodyguards? Then—she saw something odd.
The room was shadowed. The bodyguards were gone. Mr. Soot, the Drake [Mastermind], just…sat there. Staring at Bearclaw.
No—staring ahead. Bearclaw looked around. And she saw a shadow in the room.
Someone closed the door behind Bearclaw. She spun. And a huge figure shut the door. Bearclaw reached for her steel claws. A Gnoll?
No. The—thing—was too big for a Gnoll. It towered over her. It looked like her. Vaguely. But something was wrong.
If Bearclaw was a Gnoll. This was—was—a not-Gnoll. Like some bestial version of the Gnoll. Longer claws. Huge, corded muscle, rank, dark fur.
She smelled blood. And the stench—first masked by the reek of sewers—finally revealed that alien, bestial scent. The figure stared at her. Eyes both sharp and alive and dull of intelligence.
Someone coughed. Bearclaw whirled. A figure stood behind the corpse of Mr. Soot. And Bearclaw saw at last.
His head sat on his shoulders. But someone had made a parting in his skin. They’d put the head back after they’d taken it off. But bodies—were so fragile.
The culprit was a huge figure. Bigger than the other Raskghar. She coughed again, a deep, wet sound. Bearclaw looked around. There were more of them in the room.
“Who are you? What did you do with Soot?”
As if she didn’t know. But the figure just laughed. Then coughed again.
“I. Am Nokha.”
Her voice was deep. The words unfamiliar on her tongue. But she did speak them. Bearclaw’s fur was standing on end. She heard more coughing—from the side.
The other not-Gnolls were…sick. Now Bearclaw saw them, she saw the marks of disease on one, fur fallen out, sickness in their open sores. Others were coughing, or missing teeth.
“What are you? Why did you kill Soot?”
Bearclaw licked her lips. The figure—Nokha—grinned. She gestured at the dead Drake.
“Mr. Soot? Yes. He said many things. Gave us potions. Didn’t make us better.”
She pointed. In a shadowed corner, Bearclaw made out a figure.
Several figures. The dead bodyguards. And among them—one of the Raskghar. Another one of the…giant not-Gnolls. He was dead. Infection had consumed his corpse. Bearclaw could smell it now, rank.
They were all sick. But the one—Nokha—looked healthiest of them all. She grinned as Bearclaw looked around.
“Potions not work. But other things do.”
