“I’m slow. I’m not out of shape, Mrsha—”
The Gnoll was patting Ryoka’s stomach to see if there was more fat. The Gnoll looked up as Ryoka explained.
“—but I don’t get any Skills. My control over the wind is a lot better. I can call a gale, and the wind is always at my back. I can even do this.”
She blew wind straight up. Mrsha leapt off Ryoka’s lap and dashed around, awestruck as the wind tried to pick her up. The wind gusted up out of the hole in the dome over the Garden of Sanctuary.
—And Bird blinked at the wind suddenly rising up around him. He looked about.
“How strange. The wind? Wait. This is it! I can fly!”
He began climbing out of his tower. Half the Workers on the roof of the inn tried to stop Bird from jumping.
Inside the Garden, Ryoka made the wind stop. She looked wistfully upwards.
“…But it’s not powerful. Not like Skills or a…[Fireball] spell. It’s good for a City Runner, but I can’t beat Charlay or Alevica in a footrace.”
“That’s the Centauress and [Witch], right? With the magic broom.”
Erin sighed wistfully. Ryoka thought Erin would not enjoy meeting Alevica. Charlay would love Erin. If Ryoka could ever get her to visit…
“Right. They’re both faster than me by a lot. That’s my point. You know Hawk, right, Mrsha?”
The little Gnoll nodded. He was faster than Ryoka. The City Runner sighed again.
“I need to get faster. But I can’t level. And I’m not about to chug mana potions until my body turns to magic. Well…it’s an idea. But the point is, I need something that uses the wind.”
She eyed Erin significantly. The young woman blinked. Then her eyes narrowed.
“So a [Seamstress]…whoa. You mean…like…”
She mimed flapping her arms. Mrsha’s eyes went round. Ryoka grinned.
“Maybe not just yet. I can’t control the wind fully and I don’t want to fly and—die.”
The wind could turn on her if it got—moody. Ryoka could just imagine it slamming her into the ground. But she had plans.
“Know any good [Seamstresses], Erin?”
“Uh—uh—Octavia and Revi might know some. Let’s ask! I saw you blowing kids around with the wind! With mini-sails! Hey—can you do that for me? We can make a little cart with a sail—hey! We could travel that way! Like a pirate’s ship, except on land! You can be Toren 2.0!”
Ryoka gave Erin a flat look. The young woman scuffed one foot on the ground.
“…Sorry.”
The City Runner laughed. And Mrsha raced into the inn—appearing in hers and Lyonette’s room. The [Princess] and Pawn leapt away from each other. Mrsha stopped.
“Mrsha! I thought you were—”
Ryoka saw Lyonette getting up and slamming the door. She eyed Pawn. He waved at her. Ryoka’s jaw dropped.
“No fucking way.”
“What?”
Erin craned her neck, but all she saw was the door slam as Mrsha was practically thrown back into the garden with a large bed sheet. The Gnoll looked smug. She gave Ryoka a glance. And Ryoka Griffin—
“Uh. Erin? Do you think—Lyonette and Pawn—”
“Oh, they’re dating.”
Ryoka nearly fell off the hill. Erin gave her a blank look.
“They’ve been dating for ages. It’s so—cute! Pawn likes Lyonette. She likes him.”
“Right. Right. But do you think…”
“What?”
The City Runner hesitated. She wanted to ask Lyonette first. But Mrsha was giving her a look that said everything. Holy shit.
“…Let me get back to you. Mrsha, do you want to fly?”
The Gnoll eagerly tied the sheets into a knot. Ryoka laughed. In Pawn’s room, Lyonette covered her face.
“Oh no.”
A few minutes later, The Wandering Inn had a…moment. Bird, who had been convinced jumping off the roof was not a sound move, saw a white, billowing shape. A…parachute.
