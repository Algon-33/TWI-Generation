It was a proper inn. The best in the city. The [Innkeeper] was quite prosperous. His tables were polished to perfection, and he employed a [Chef] with [Advanced Cooking]. His drinks were famous, locally, at least. And his beds were as soft as could be.
And they were [Knights] so of course they found their way there. The six [Knights] of the Clairei Order were toasting each other after a long journey on the road.
“Six days from the Order’s headquarters. And six days back. Six deliveries, when a single junior [Knight] might have made it themselves.”
The [Knight] speaking, a young man with the beginnings of a mustache, grimaced. His companions did likewise as they toasted him. Six mugs clinked, and they all downed their drinks. The speaker wiped his mouth with a sigh. At least the alcohol took the edge off.
Sir Molte of the Clairei Knights, rumored to have the fastest [Knights] on the entire continent, was about think up another toast. It had been a long journey, and he was in the mood to drink. The proof lay in the three rounds of mugs that had already been taken away, and the satisfied smile on the [Innkeeper]’s face. The Clairei Knights were downing their fourth round when the door opened.
“Good evening, Sir Knight!”
The [Innkeeper]’s voice made Sir Molte glance up. For a second Molte wondered if a seventh member of their order had joined them by chance. But one look towards the open door instantly disproved that theory.
A man wearing polished, bright, pink armor stepped into the inn, looking around. He had a quite handsome face, but his armor? You couldn’t call it a pale red, or a light purple. There was no way getting around it. It was pink. And there was only one order on all of Izril, no, surely, the entire world who sported that unfortunate color.
Sir Molte eyed the man’s bright, pink armor and repressed his amusement. Some of the other Clairei Knights were less circumspect. Molte heard a chuckle and a snort. He waved them to silence and stood up as the [Knight] walked past the [Innkeeper].
“Sir Rose Knight! Come join us! It’s always welcome to have a fellow knight errant at the table!”
“Pink or yellow, it matters not!”
One of the other [Knights] called out. There was a chuckle from the Clairei Knights and a cautious chuckle from the other tables nearby. The [Innkeeper] hesitated. But the Rose Knight walked towards the six Clairei Knights as if that had been his intention all along. He removed his helmet and carefully put it into a bag of holding at his side.
Sir Molte eyed the bag of holding with envy, and then took a good look at the armor. Of course, the Knights of the Petal were renowned for their nigh-unbreakable armor. The quality of their arms—Molte nearly choked on his drink as he saw the battleaxe on the [Knight]’s back. Now there was a weapon no one in the Order of Clairei Fields would ever dream of using! He half-rose and beckoned for a chair.
“Come and sit, Ser. I am Sir Molte. Will you drink with us?”
The other [Knight] was clearly a good deal older than the young Clairei Knights. And that demanded respect, even if the armor did not. The Clairei Knights schooled their merriment. The Rose Knight looked at them. Then he shook his head.
“I’m afraid my business does not allow me to drink. But I do have business with you, sir. And your order.”
“Oh?”
Sir Molte looked up. There was an aspect of the older [Knight]’s tone that Molte didn’t like. He reassured himself that his sword and shield were still on his person. And his comrades numbered five. The [Knight] was alone.
