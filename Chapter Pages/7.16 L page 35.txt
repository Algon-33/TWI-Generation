Someone had caught his hand. Just once. Relc was bleeding. But he’d stopped one punch. He looked at Klbkch. Then he sagged.
Fell.
Silence. The scrying orb lay on the ground, where Embria had dropped it. And the Walled Cities stared. And they saw him.
Klbkch the Slayer.
Centenium of Rhir.
For just a second. For just a moment he had been…something else. Now—Zevara saw the Skill fading from him. But he still stood. Unbroken. The soul had surpassed the body. He walked towards her and she flinched. He paused, staring at her.
She realized her sword was drawn. So was Jeiss’. She looked at Klbkch.
Wrong. All wrong. He hadn’t—Relc had tried—Zevara stared at the fallen [Soldiers]. Relc, lying on the ground, shielding his daughter.
It shouldn’t have been like that. If only—but he shouldn’t have been. He was foreign. A creature made, not born of this world.
Antinium.
Slowly, the Centenium lowered his head. He regarded the scrying orb lying on the ground. And he met the eyes of the Walled City’s defenders. Drakes and Gnolls. The Antinium laughed, a high, chittering noise.
His foot crushed the scrying orb. Then he turned and walked away. Leaving this gathering behind.
Going toward the Hive. The other Antinium, defects, were gone. And if they were not?
They died. Klbkch had hope. Or—perhaps the opposite. For a second, he could remember everything he had lost. What a cruel gift. Somewhere, a sleeping god laughed in the darkness.

Death came for the Hive. But—the Antinium had left. They had fled, to a Garden where they would be safe. An inn. A tragedy had happened. But they would live.
That was how it should have been. But—it was not. They were all gone. Yellow Splatters, Purple Smile, Chesacre, Thaina, Anand—all of them.
But one. One, remained. The first. The last.
He refused to go. And Lyonette and Erin, held back, realized it too late. But the Worker sat in that beautiful, sad place where he had made a home.
The [Priest], the first of the Individuals waited.
He had not much to his name. Only a few things. His faith. A dream. A [Princess]’s love.
Memory. And this. He held a censer. Smoke drifted from it as Pawn stood.
A shadow of the past stood in the doorway. His sword was drawn. It shone, like silver and steel. But something else. A relic, forged from the past. Something that did not break.
Nor did the one who stood there. He spoke.
“You will not be brought back. The Rite of Anastases is not for you, failure.”
“I know. But I will not go. You are wrong. And I—will not run when I am right. Some things are worth dying for.”
Pawn spoke. Klbkch looked at him.
“Is that all you have to say?”
The Worker looked up at the dirt ceiling. He spread his four arms.
“I wish I could show you what I see, Klbkch. There is more than what you know. I see something glorious. What you call failure, I call a miracle. Can you not let us be? We are not enemies.”
“No. You stand and defile all I remember. I gave you one chance. You did not heed it. So. Die.”
He walked forwards, so gracefully. Like a dancer from another age. Even with his broken body—perfection. The sword floated across the room, born by the spectre of death.
Pawn stood. He lifted his censer with two hands as the other two clasped in prayer. And he looked at the death. He began to walk, and the smoke drifted behind him. Sweet innocence.
The two walked into the center of the room. Pawn stopped. He saw Klbkch raise his arm, tense. There was no perfection here, no memory of greatness.
Just a blade, aimed at a head. It swung down.
