Interlude – Numbtongue (Pt.2)

“Goblins have no laws? We have the ones that matter. The Chieftain leads. Goblins should not kill Goblins. We have no books. And we have no [Guards]. We guard ourselves. Perhaps that is silly. But it works. We have order. It goes like this. One Goblin leads, and the others follow. As [Kings] rule, Goblins do too. But no one watches Goblins, so how would you know? And as for building…”
He paused and looked around. The inn was silent, watching, unsure. Pyrite shrugged.
“I do not build. But I find. I mine. Once, there was a Goblin who loved treasures. And he taught himself to find them in the mountain. For fun.”
Slowly, he withdrew the object he’d grasped. Keldrass gasped along with everyone around him. A gold nugget rested in Pyrite’s palm. He regarded it idly, and looked around. The glitter of the metal caught every eye. Gold. But Pyrite tossed it up and down. Jelaqua’s voice was strangled.
“Hold on. Numbtongue, where’d you get—”
“He—I—found it. Mined it from a mountain. From Rockmites and stone. Do you like it?”
“Um…yes?”
The Goblin smiled.
“Want it?”
He held the nugget out. Keldrass stared and his claws twitched. So did Jelaqua; Pyrite had held it out between her, Bevussa, and the Drake. All three adventurers reached for it at once, and Pyrite pulled the nugget back. He spoke again, tossing the heavy orb up and down. Hypnotizing the crowd.
“Once. There was a Goblin. He liked shiny things. Gold. Gems. Mana stones. They glittered and he found a way to mine them. They were his. He went into caves with monsters and got them. He mined them. If he was a Drake, they would say ‘that is his treasure’. But adventurers did not think so. They saw he had treasure and they tried to kill him for it.”
He looked around.
“Was that fair? They did not mine it. They did not earn it. They tried to kill him for it. And they killed his tribe. They hunted him. They built nothing. They only destroyed. That was all they ever did.”
“That’s—different. They—we’re adventurers. We hunt monsters. If you had a hoard, they would target you.”
Keldrass sounded as though he wasn’t certain of himself. He stared at the gold as Pyrite tossed it up and down. The Hobgoblin shrugged.
“And if I was a person, I would call them [Thieves]. But a Goblin is a Goblin. A Goblin is a monster. An animal. It can be tamed. But it is still an animal. Right?”
He looked around the room. Some didn’t meet his eyes. Others did. Like Erin. She mouthed at Numbtongue.
Who are you?
And the Goblin winked at her. Just for a moment. Then he offered the nugget again to Keldrass. The gold glinted in the fading light.
“Want it?”
The Drake hesitated. He looked around the room, warring with himself. But the gold was gold. And Drakes were the children of Dragons.
“Yes. Why? Is it a bribe? A gift? Proof you’re a person?”
His expression said he might say anything to have it, and to be out of the spotlight. Pyrite just grinned a Goblin’s grin.
“Nothing. It’s yours. If you pick it up.”
He tossed the nugget on the floor. It was a decent toss; the nugget rolled a bit, but it was so heavy it actually dented the floorboards. Keldrass started. He looked at Pyrite and then around. Everyone watched him. The Drake considered how much it would cost his image to bend over and pick up the nugget. Then he stiffly walked over. Pyrite waited until the Drake was moving. And then, as Keldrass bent, he spoke one word.
“Fetch.”
The Drake—froze. And so did the room.  Slowly, Keldrass turned. His face was flushed under his scales. He glared at Pyrite, but with a hint of triumph.
“Never.”
