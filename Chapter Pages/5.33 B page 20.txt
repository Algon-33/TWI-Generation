“No. The Workers and Soldiers are made to an exacting standard. Something—an imperfection in the growing stage—led to this flaw. It is not your fault.”
The Worker considered this.
“Oh. That is good.”
The queen nodded. She didn’t know why she had told the Worker that. Perhaps it was an admission of her guilt. She did not oversee the process by which new Soldiers and Workers were brought to life. Many were created each week. But she should have paid more attention. Perhaps the flaw was rampant among the others. She would inspect the process herself, order Klbkch to manually check each one of the birthing pods. It would be too late for those already formed however, just as though it was too late for this one.
“Come closer, Worker.”
“I will.”
Bird walked forwards. The Queen stared at him. A pity. But the other Individuals were sound and more could be made. A mistake was a mistake.
“So Klbkchhezeim gave you a position guarding this Human. Sensible. But he should not have hidden the truth from me. You are flawed. And that is unforgivable.”
“It is?”
The Queen nodded. She moved slowly, raising her massive feelers. Just one was large enough to grab the Worker. He stood in front of her, tilting his head back and forth.
“So it is my fault after all? Am I in trouble? I get in trouble with Revalantor Klbkch almost as much as Pawn.”
“I am sure you do. But this is not your fault. And it will be corrected soon.”
“That is good! I want to go back to Miss Erin’s inn soon. I left my bow there and I am waiting for water birds. I have not seen any before, but they will appear someday. Erin says it might happen. Oh, but Revalantor Klbkch says I must not speak about birds. I cannot speak about them. But I like birds. I sit in my tower all day and look for them. And sometimes I shoot fish.”
He babbled nonsense as the Queen slowly drew her feelers around him. She lifted the little Worker up, tightening her feelers slowly. He did not seem to notice. He spoke brightly and cheerfully.
“You are a big Queen. Not at all like a bird. I am Bird. Is it hard to breathe? I am very high. Like a bird! I always wanted to be a bird.”
“I am sure.”
The carapace cracked. Bird made a sound. The Queen found his head. She heard his voice, muffled. Still speaking.
“I always wanted to fly. Belgrade says a Worker cannot fly but I am very high. I am very high. I am very high, all up in the sky. I am Bird. I like to fly. So very high. When my Queen holds me, I am in the sky. Will I die? Fly, fly. Fly.”
And he sang. The Queen froze. Her feeler encircled the Worker’s head. He sang, his voice muffled, the words nonsense. His tune meandered, but his voice was pure. He sang.
She had not heard a song in the Hive. Not since coming to Izril. Not since—the Queen’s grip loosened. She slowly lowered Bird. The Antinium looked up at her. He had stopped singing.
“What was that song?”
The Free Queen stared at him. Bird tilted his head.
“What song? Oh. That song? I made it up. It is a song about flying. Because I flew.”
The Queen stared at him.
“You sing? Workers do not sing.”
“They do not?”
Bird suddenly looked worried, for the first time since he had been here. He looked around and then hunched his shoulders.
“I did not know that. I will stop singing.”
“No—”
The Queen couldn’t help it. She bent down and Bird looked up.
“Do not stop. Workers do not sing. But I desire you to.”
“Really?”
“Yes. I am your Queen. Sing for me. Sing—Bird.”
He looked up at her. The Queen looked down. Bird shrugged. And began to sing.
