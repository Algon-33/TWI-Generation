They looked past her. The last of Giants. The last in this world. No one talked about reviving their kind. They had laughed when she asked if they ever thought about it.
“…Then. Is it right? The side I’m on? Do you ever wonder if you’re doing good? Or evil?”
She was afraid. Afraid to shoot the gun. In self-defense? Oh yes. But they wanted it for war. The kind of war she had seen only the edges of. Wounded coming back. She had shot an Adult Creler with it and watched the bullets ricochet off the armor.
Am I on the right side? Her…the people who had found her were so like her, but unlike her in appearance at the same time. And they were called…Demons.
This was hell. But perhaps those were only words? Flora had judged them, as they judged her. She had reservations. So had they. She did not think they were evil, or the Demons you heard about mentioned with wrath and hellfire.
Yet they had wrath. And some could conjure hellfire. And they were called…Demons. All these things were also true.
The Giants thought about this. Callidaz was the one who shook his head again. And once more—he sounded mystified. Her concern he tried to understand. That she mattered to him was even humbling. But he had to try to understand.
“You say that. You small people. You come, now and then. Asking if this is right. If this is good. If this is evil. And you worry that they call us Demons.”
“Yes. It—means something from home. My world. Something evil.”
“Then do not call us that. We are Giants. They call us Demons. Demon Giants. But those are words. Demon is a word. Giant is a word. They are convenient words. But like good and evil—just words.”
Another voice. Another Giant spoke. He stared straight ahead.
“Good and evil. They sound like words Dragons made up. They are tricky, Dragons. Tricksome. They think things should be so.”
“Yes.”
“Dragons. So tricksome.”
“Things must be to them. Like [Mages]. Always words.”
The other Giants murmured. Flora looked at them, desperately.
“I know the Demons did not start this war. But—but is it right, Callidaz? Maybe good and evil are just words. But is it right? Did the Elves die because of the Blighted Kingdom? Who killed them?”
“I do not know.”
Callidaz calmly shrugged. More earth fell. He went on.
“I do not remember. I am young. By some ways of counting. Elves were before me. I know my people have died. Humans have killed them.”
“And Drakes.”
“Dragons.”
“Lizardfolk.”
“Jinn.”
“Djinn.”
“Gnolls.”
They whispered the words, of every race, living and gone. Callidaz looked at Flora after the echoes stopped.
“All things kill us. We kill all things. Some of us made great war. Some of us fought for peace or other things. If you ask if Giants are on one…side…we are not. Here we sit. We fight alongside those you call Demons. That is all I know.”
It was beyond her comprehension, how they lived. They should rage. Rage, against the kingdoms who had slaughtered them, breaking ancient pacts. She had listened to Silvenia’s lessons, read the books only Demons wrote or kept.
She had hated the Kingdoms of Terandria, who had made war with the giants who built their palaces. The people of Chandrar, who had ended an entire people of Jinn and taken captive the Djinni.
And yet…no one was blameless. So the Giants were right. Here they were. She had to make a choice. The [King] had offered her a choice. Silvenia had offered her many choices.
Flora closed her eyes.
“I wish it didn’t have to be like this.”
“Ah, wishes. But even Djinn cannot grant ours. I made a wish of one once. And she wept.”
