The Goblins from Tremborag’s tribe didn’t look afraid. They outnumbered the Goblins around Rags. Then they saw hundreds of Goblins behind Rags grab crossbows and aim it at them. The Goblins turned and fled back towards their camp.
“No shoot! Get crossbows behind Hobs! And keep other Goblins back! No Goblin gets in, no Goblin goes out!”
Rags shouted at the Hobs, who grunted and nodded. Pyrite looked around, eying the other camps.
“Have to talk sometime, Chieftain.”
“Not now! Not to them. Will talk soon. We wait for him.”
“Him?”
Poisonbite looked confused. Rags glanced at Pyrite. The Hob nodded. Of course he would be here soon. Tremborag? Possibly not. But Garen Redfang wasn’t patient. Or afraid of confrontation.
Sure enough, it was only an hour later that Rags heard a commotion again. This time she didn’t get a chance to get to the front. Garen Redfang ignored the Hobs standing guard. He rode his Carn Wolf down on a pair of them and kicked the female in the face while his Carn Wolf knocked over the male. He rode straight into the camp with his warriors spreading out behind him. Goblins backed up as Redfang looked around. He bellowed one word that made both camps go silent for a second.
“Rags!”
And then she was there. Rags strode forwards, unarmed, Pyrite, Redscar, Quietstab, and Poisonbite at her back. Noears was having violent diarrhea somewhere else. Garen stared down at Rags. His eyes narrowed.
“You betrayed me.”
Rags sighed. It wasn’t like Goblins did small talk anyways. She looked up at Garen and raised her voice.
“I betrayed no one. I took my tribe from mountain. It was bad place. Not-Goblin place!”
Garen snarled. His Carn Wolf growled loudly, and the smaller Carn Wolves backed away as the alpha wolf bared its teeth.
“You stole my warriors! My Redfangs!”
Rags folded her arms.
“They came with me. Your fault. You let Goblins rape Human women. You gave tribe to Tremborag. I was your Chieftain. Not him.”
“They were my warriors!”
Garen howled. He had a hand on his sword. The Goblins around him tensed. But Rags just shook her head. She felt…bad. Not bad as in scared or upset. Just disappointed. She’d wondered what Garen’s reaction would be. And it was everything she’d thought. He was just how she remembered. But she was not.
“You lost them, Redfang. Not me. They followed me because you were poor Chieftain. Ask Redscar.”
She stepped to one side. Garen turned his burning gaze to the Goblin who was studying his feet with interest. He growled a word, a note of betrayal.
“Redscar.”
“Garen.”
At last, Redscar looked up at Garen. The two locked eyes. Garen leaned forwards over his Carn Wolf. Redscar’s own wolf, Thunderfur, slunk over, growling at Garen’s wolf. The two stared at each other for a long moment. The Redfang Warriors behind Garen and the ones in Rags’ camp stared between the two Goblins. At last, Redscar spoke.
“That was not Goblin. You told us.”
“I told you to obey. We fought Goblin Lord! Tremborag’s Goblins are them. We leave them be. Deal with it!”
Garen shouted at Redscar. The Goblin gritted his teeth and shook his head.
“What about pride? What about Redfangs? We are warriors, not—that!”
He pointed scornfully at Tremborag’s camp. Garen growled.
“You betrayed me. You are not Redfang.”
Redscar’s eyes blazed. He slapped his chest and raised his voice.
“I am Redfang! I led tribe! I fought! What did former Chieftain do? Hide in mountain? Hurt Human females? Chieftain was coward! Not-Goblin! Rags was better Chieftain than Garen could be!”
