“You must hear something to believe it? You have the ego of a mole. I am proud of you, again. How many times do you wish me to say it?”
“A few more?”
The faerie took wing, snorting. But her voice drifted down to Ryoka as she flew off to another sight.
“I am proud of you. I am proud of you. How many more times…?”

They were alike. That was why they were friends. For Ryoka, Ivolethe happily defied the will of the faerie king, no matter what he might do.
“Be honest, Ivolethe. What could he do to you?”
“The worst of it? Do you really want to know?”
“Really. Please.”
Ivolethe thought about this.
“For such as this…he might lock me in a place without light or sound or sensation. Take away my form and imprison me in a wretched body. Until a star was born and died.”
“…Fuck.”
“He probably will not. That was a punishment for the old days. I think he will be wrathful, but not that much.”
Ivolethe hastened to assure Ryoka. She paused, and then her smile turned melancholy.
“I truly doubt he will be that wrathful. He will respect your journey. And he does not punish us as in the old ways so much. We are too few, these days.”
Ryoka looked at Ivolethe. The truth about the faerie lands—all secrets—they were one of the reasons she’d come.
“Ivolethe…I came for Erin. She’s—half-alive. Half-dead. Neither.”
“Aye. We will do something about that.”
“We will?”
Ivolethe nodded.
“As much as can be done.”
“Should we—petition the faerie king for aid? I could do it. If it means he isn’t angry at you—”
Smack. Ivolethe hit Ryoka. With a fist, rather than a palm. Ryoka rubbed at her shoulder.
“Ow! What the hell, Ivolethe!”
“Are you stupid? You want to invoke the Faerie King? He’ll punish us both. You nearly did it at the party didn’t you?”
“I—ow! Ow! Maybe! I thought it might help?”
“Help? Does his name and the idea of mercy often join hands and dance about in your mind?”
Ivolethe had Ryoka’s ear and was shouting into it. The faerie looked delighted at being able to push Ryoka about; Ryoka remembered doing that to the little faerie. She winced as Ivolethe let go of her ear.
“Okay, bad idea. But we need help!”
“And I’m not good enough? He is too much! If you had spoken his name, even in your world…”
“But I don’t know his name. Only…well, one of the ones in stories.”
The Frost Fae looked disgusted. She thought for a second, floated off, then called over.
“Oi, Wind Runner of Reizmelt!”
“Ah.”
“Hey you. You over there with the black hair! Ye cunt of an idiot! Do any of these names not fit you?”
“I get it! Fine! But what would have happened if I called his name?”
That was a better question. Ivolethe floated around, and found a stone on the ground. She tossed it.
“There. Which side did that stone land on?”
“Um…I’m going to assume that was rhetorical.”
Ivolethe grinned toothily.
“That was the aspect of him you would have summoned.”
“Ah. Shit.”
“Exactly. You might have summoned nothing at all, most like. If the other fae watched you, it was to see what would happen. Perhaps he would have been all sunshine and rainbows, and pardoned me and given you ten thousand cures for your friend while dancing ye about! Or perhaps your entire party would have disappeared.”
Ryoka gulped. Ivolethe shook her head, disgusted. Then she turned and gave Ryoka a tiny look of approval.
“…I say this. But you did not say his name. And you bypassed the petty Wyrm and one of the Summer Court. That Melidore, I will make him suffer for his tricks.”
She growled, speaking his true name behind the half-name Ryoka heard. The Wind Runner blinked.
“You know him?”
