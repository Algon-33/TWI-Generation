“Oh, I’ve got tons. Only there’s a slight problem…”
When she presented Ilvriss with the cake with Goblins decorated on it, Embria stared at the Wall Lord, waiting for his reaction. Ilvriss eyed the Goblin drawn in frosting and sighed.
“Typical. Fine, I’ll pay for one for every Drake at my table and whatever Swifttail’s bill is I’ll cover for the night. No cake for me. It’s far too sugary.”
“Want some mayonnaise instead?”
Ilvriss sighed.
“Give me your menu, Human. And don’t push your luck.”
He went to sit down at his table. Embria returned to sit with Relc, wide-eyed.
“Wall Lord Ilvriss eats here?”
Relc grinned.
“Told ya. Old Zel ate here too, before…you know. People like Erin.”
“I can’t believe he didn’t take offense. What were we talking about?”
“You said you were ordered to come back here. Was it to see me?”
Embria looked frostily at Relc as he gave her a big smile.
“Hardly. I was ordered to return because my company had few wounded and because we could be spared. I would have argued to stay on the front, but I thought I might as well return to give you this. Here.”
She reached behind her and picked up the spear. Relc eyed it and his eyes widened.
“Hey wait a second! That’s mine!”
She nodded.
“Took you long enough to figure it out.”
“I was looking at you! Hey, are you giving it to me? Did you do your old man a favor?”
“No. I’m just delivering it. The army doesn’t need your spear and they’ve decided to let you have it since Liscor’s gotten more dangerous. You sent them fifteen letters—”
“Hah, I knew that would do the trick! Alright, my old spear! Thanks for bringing it, kid!”
Relc was overjoyed. He grabbed the haft of the spear and grunted. Embria hadn’t let go.
“Um. Kid? Hello? Embria?”
His daughter stared at Relc. Her arms didn’t move an inch.
“Dad. You should come back.”
The big Drake froze. He held onto his spear as he stared at Embria. His eyes slid past her.
“What? Nah, nah, I’m good, thanks. I retired, remember? They wouldn’t want—”
“I talked to my commander. He says you could reenlist. You’d have your old rank back. You could join our company in the city and come back with me after the Goblin Lord’s dead.”
“Look, k—Embria. That’s a nice offer, but I’m done with the army. Can I have my spear now? Please?”
Senior Guardsman Relc tried to smile. Embria stared at him, unblinking.
“Tell me why.”
“I told you last time. I like it here.”
“Still?”
“Staying in one place doesn’t make me stop liking it Embria. I like not being in the army more now, actually. It’s restful being in Liscor. Well, mostly. I get to fight and relax, you know?”
Relc tried to laugh, but Embria looked troubled. She shook her head as if unable to listen to him.
“You’re wasted here. You’re a [Guardsman]—”
“Senior Guardsman! That’s an important rank!”
“A Senior Guardsmen when you were a legend back in the army!”
Relc’s smile faded.
“I was a [Sergeant], kid. Don’t listen to those other idiots. I was just a [Sergeant]—hell, I got paid like one and never got past that.”
“A [Sergeant] who got awarded an enchanted spear for valor? Don’t lie. You were a hero. You could have stayed and been famous!”
A pained look flashed across Relc’s face.
“I was already famous. I wanted to get old, I told you. I retired—”
“No one just quits.”
“Right, they stay even when they’re wounded or old. That’s how your mother died.”
Embria’s eyes blazed.
“She died a hero.”
“Yeah.”
Relc didn’t meet his daughter’s eyes. He gripped the spear tighter. There was a creak from Embria’s chair and the table between then. Neither Drake moved.
“Let me have my spear, Embria.”
“Rejoin the army.”
“No.”
