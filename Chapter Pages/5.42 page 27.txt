“No. No. But I ask—we beg you for mercy. We will pay any ransom.”
“My goal is the dungeon’s treasure itself. No one city could afford what I seek to find. As for mercy—I have promised Ceria to let some of you go if she obeys me. I keep my word.”
Elirr looked up hopefully. Instantly, the female Raskghar protested.
“Chieftain. The Gnolls are needed. For ritual.”
“Not all of them.”
“All! We must have them. You must—”
“Must?”
Calruz spun. His hand shot out. He was fast. The female Raskghar tried to dodge, but Calruz’s hand was at her throat. She struggled—and then stopped as his hand tightened on her windpipe. The other Raskghar stirred. Mrsha was glad to see they were afraid, even if it was of Calruz. His arm flexed as he drew the female Raskghar closer.
“You speak as if you were Chieftain. But you are not. You are weaker than I am, even with the ritual. Or do you challenge me?”
“No, Chieftain.”
The female Raskghar lowered her ears and head. She submitted and hunched, lowering herself as he let her go. Calruz turned.
“So. My order stands. Not all of the Gnolls will be sacrificed. How many depends on Ceria. I have a mind to spare whomever she picks. And the white one.”
“No. Not that one! She is special!”
Another Raskghar protested in a guttural voice. Quick as a flash, Calruz turned. He backhanded the Raskghar so hard that the beast man lost a tooth. A spray of blood flew—the Raskghar fell.
“Silence!”
There was. Calruz looked at Mrsha. She tried to back into a corner of her cell and landed on her poo as he bent down.
“You. Ceria tells me that Ryoka knows you. And Erin. Why are you special?”
Mrsha quivered. Calruz glared at her. His eyes turned red.
“Answer me!”
She opened her mouth desperately, tried to point at it. The Minotaur grew angrier. He opened his mouth and his hand cracked as it dug into the top of her cage.
“Calruz, stop!”
To Mrsha’s relief, Ceria pushed forwards. She grabbed the Minotaur. Though she couldn’t pull him back, she spoke urgently and quickly.
“She’s mute. She can’t speak.”
“Mute?”
The Minotaur straightened. He looked suspiciously at Mrsha. Ceria nodded.
“She’s been mute since birth. Ryoka befriended her, like I told you. Her fur’s white—that’s probably why the Raskghar think she’s special. But she doesn’t have any powers.”
“I see. Do you think she’s special?”
Calruz glanced at the female Raskghar. Her eyes turned towards Mrsha. The little Gnoll cub flinched.
“Oh yes, Chieftain. White fur is special.”
“Why?”
The Raskghar hesitated. She looked uncertain.
“We…do not know. But we feel it. We know it. Here.”
She pointed to her chest. Calruz grunted. He looked at Elirr.
“You. Do you know why the Raskghar think she’s special? What does white fur mean among Gnolls?”
Elirr hesitated. The old Gnoll glanced at Mrsha and at Calruz. He opened his mouth. The Minotaur cut him off.
“If you lie, I will sacrifice half of the Gnolls here.”
The Gnoll bowed his head. Mrsha stared at him in terror.
“She is cursed. According to the legends of my tribe, those with white fur appear after disaster. Or before it. They may cause disaster or warn of it, but disaster comes either way. They are shunned. I thought it legend myself, but…”
Elirr glanced despairingly at Mrsha and said no more. Calruz straightened.
“So. There is some truth to these legends.”
“It’s all superstition. Come on, Calruz. You don’t believe in that. And Mrsha matters to Erin. To Ryoka.”
“Ryoka.”
The Minotaur paused. A wistful expression passed over his face. He looked at Ceria, at Mrsha, and shook his head.
