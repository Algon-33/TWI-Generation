Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 38
“It’s simply unfair. Damn this day.”
He slapped his knee. Erin thought it was the most childish thing she’d ever seen.
She liked Altestiel even more. He sulked like Mrsha would if she could speak! Erin started laughing. The Earl looked affronted and the rain began to spread, pattering off his enchanted clothing.
“I don’t appreciate mockery after being let down, Erin. You wound me.”
“Sorry—”
And so it was done. Olesm looked relieved.
“Told you so.”
Selys smacked his arm. Hard.
“You idiot.”
She felt bad for Altestiel. Not least because—it wasn’t even half a date and Erin laid that on him? Ancestors! No wonder she was alone!
And yet, the Earl’s depression did not last long. The rain stopped. He was soon laughing with Erin and badmouthing his [Queen] only a bit.
The truth was it was a failed venture from the start. A romance in a day? That was one of the movies on Kevin’s laptop and even Selys knew that was fake.
Altestiel had probably known it from the start. But he was the kind of person to go down swinging, even against hopeless odds.
The others knew it too. The smart bookies were collecting the money from the day’s bets. And paying out to the odd winner who’d predicted just this outcome.
Drassi scowled as she counted out coins for Hedault and Dawil. She glared at the Dwarf.
“You bet against yourself!”
“Yes I did. And I had a lot of fun and made money.”
The Dwarf smugly sipped from his mug. Then he looked at Erin and sighed. He nudged a green shin.
“Take a note for next time, lads. Do it right. The door’s open.”
A Hobgoblin looked down at him. Dawil squinted up—then edged over and elbowed Numbtongue. And the Dwarf made one mistake.

It was never that simple. The [Knights] were in the tent when the group of [Soldiers] entered.
“There he is. Come on—”
“What are you doing?”
“We’re seeing what’s behind the helmet. We’ve got a bet on it. Don’t worry, we won’t show you [Knights]. Not a word! Just me—and it’s a truth spell, right?”
One of the [Soldiers] turned. And Rabbiteater recognized the [Mage] with a jolt in his chest.
Telich with the truth spells. The [Mage] was rubbing his hands.
“Get him to the interrogation tent. You two—stand watch.”
“This is an outrage! He is a prisoner of war and a [Knight]! Hey! I demand—”
[Silence]. The spell enveloped the [Knights]. They surged to their feet—but the other [Soldiers] knocked them down, subduing the shackled [Knights]. Talia shouted wordlessly as four grabbed Rabbiteater.
Ah. Behind his helmet, the Goblin smiled.
He felt better this way. This felt right.
“We won’t harm you. It’s just a single look. Inquiring minds are willing to pay to know…apparently you know someone important, Ser.”
The [Mage] assured the silent [Knight]. He hustled Rabbiteater into the tent. The Hobgoblin was tensed.
One [Mage]. Four [Soldiers]. They were flanking him and had a grip on him—and he had manacles on arms and legs. But…they had made a mistake. He let them escort him, shuffling. He tensed as the flap opened—
And saw ten more [Soldiers], all co-conspirators, waiting to see the truth behind the helmet. Rabbiteater untensed. He looked around then laughed and sighed.
“Ah.”
The [Mage] ordered them to put him in the chair. Four held him down—the Goblin was just waiting. Open the helmet. He at least had his teeth.
“Someone help me get the helmet off! Damn! It’s locked! Even the visor! Someone’s got a secret. You, you—”

Something was wrong. Erin Solstice listened to Altestiel’s complaints. She was smiling. Laughing. But she felt it.
Rabbiteater. She stopped smiling.
