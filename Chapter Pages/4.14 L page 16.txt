“No, but it looks like there’s a problem. It’s a staffing issue and Erin’s making a mistake. At least…she might be. Lyonette could be lying, or exaggerating the problem, or there’s something else at work here.”
Ryoka chewed at her lip distractedly. Pawn listened obediently, since she seemed to know what she was talking about.
“No one’s impartial in a pissing match…and office drama is always ugly, so why not [Barmaid] drama. Damnit.”
She thought for a second and then looked at him.
“Hey Pawn, how much do you trust Lyonette? I mean, how much would you trust what she said? One hundred percent?”
Pawn didn’t have to think to answer.
“She fed my Soldiers and I. She gave us honey, and offered us food when no one else would. She helped paint my Soldiers. She gave them respite and shelter. I do not know Safry and Maran. But I would trust anything Lyonette said.”
Ryoka nodded grimly.
“That’s what I thought. She’s changed. And Maran and Safry, well, they did come from Agnes’ inn…maybe I should do something about this.”
Pawn had no idea what that meant. But he felt relieved and tired. It was over. His Soldiers were safe. He could pray, and know they would be safe. Prayer was good, but knowing was better. He sagged in his seat.
“I am going to sleep.”
Ryoka blinked at him.
“Wait, what?”
But it was too late. Pawn, exhausted by fighting and grief, slowly drifted off into slumber. All would be well. He believed that.
His dreams were still filled with death. The Antinium he held in his arms had no paint on his body.
But he was still dead all the same.
