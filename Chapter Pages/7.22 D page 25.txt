Geneva Scala hesitated. She bent down, touched her toes. Then stood upright. Experimentally, she reached out, pulled her fingers back.
They nearly touched her forearm. Geneva bent down, touched her toes, and walked her hands back. She was as flexible as a gymnast. It was—uncanny.
“Okasha?”
“Hah! So that’s what it does! Hey Geneva, guess what?”
“You leveled up.”
“I leveled—aw.”
The Selphid pouted internally. Then she brightened up.
“That’s right! I have a Skill, which means it affects you! [Physical Enhancement: Flexibility]. See? Look!”
She reached out with Geneva’s left arm. Siri blanched as the arm rotated nearly a hundred and eighty degrees, moving way further than it should normally. Geneva felt the strain, but her fingers were waggling, demonstrating insane dexterity. She wasn’t made of rubber, but she had the kind of flexibility that only occurred in a very few amount of people.
“What…is that? Geneva?”
“Flexibility. Okasha leveled up.”
“Oh.”
Siri responded faintly. Geneva frowned. This could be useful. It was also disturbing, but it would help with surgeries. That was her main concern. She frowned as Okasha made her scratch that itch on her back that normal Geneva had never reached.
“When did you level up, Okasha?”
“Five hours ago. I went to sleep. You didn’t even notice. You were controlling me for a bit. Creepy. Good thing I have that Skill that lets you move even when I’m not awake.”
“Yes. How many Skills does that make?”
“Um…one, two…five? Nice skill, huh? We can probably do all kinds of weird maneuvers now! I can’t wait to try it out! Let me try, please, please?”
“No. It’s a useful Skill, though. It’d have been better if it was a Skill to reduce my fatigue so I can work longer.”
Okasha sighed as Siri backed away from the one-sided conversation, for her.
“I’m only Level 11, Geneva. You want a refreshment Skill? Wait until I get to Level 20, at least! But I’m leveling up quick, huh?”
Yes. Very quickly. Geneva blinked a few times.
“You’re Level 11? I thought you were Level 4 when—never mind. We have to get to that meeting. Siri, I’m grabbing the container. Grab two of the masks. The oversized one is for Fezimet. I’d bring armor, but apparently that’s an ‘insult’. And the gloves.”
She walked out of the clinic. Okasha was audibly disappointed.
“Come on, let’s try something out! Isn’t it cool? First the box at Level 10, now this! I might be the first Selphid in living memory to have this class! It’s nothing like the old stories!”
Geneva marched out of her clinic. She stared at the rising sun. She must have been awake all night. Again. But she’d gotten to her patients. That was what mattered. Anyways, she had [Lesser Endurance] now. That cut down on the fatigue. She was leveling too.
“What old stories, Okasha? And keep silent when we get to Fezimet’s tower. I need to focus.”
Okasha sighed. And her voice was a bit…bitter.
“You never listen. I told you twice. And when I leveled up! You didn’t even let me eat cake for the Level 10 celebration. It’s always work, work, work with you…you need rest, Geneva!”
“Okasha.”
“Fine. This is important. But promise me you’ll lie down? I’m looking at your body and it looks worse! Also, you need to poo. Nice, healthy poo. Nothing like that Yellow Rivers stuff. Disgusting—”
“Okasha!”
“Fine. I’m shutting up. Congratulations, Okasha! I’m only a Level 11 [Inner Friend]. Odd, though. The old stories never have this class. It was always…[Controller]. [Dominator]. [Overlord]. This is strange. But we’re friends so that’s why. Right Geneva? Geneva?”
