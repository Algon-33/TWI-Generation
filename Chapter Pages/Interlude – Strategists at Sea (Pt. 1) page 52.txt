Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)

The students looked at each other. Merrik’s eye went wide. Slowly, he took off his helmet. Wil still didn’t understand. The pieces were there. He stared. And began to make out something.
The coral was moving. It was…walking. Two legs were carrying it across the sea’s floor. The [Lord] stared. The coral was all…part of the thing. And the fish, the dolphins and other creatures that lived around the mighty protector…
Guardians of nature. A walking bed of coral. Ancient beings.
And then he had it. Wil murmured.
“That’s not coral. That’s…a tree.”
The others looked at him. And then they saw it. Fossilized wood. Nature, turned to coral. A banished protector of the land. Banished by civilization. Merrik stared wordlessly, and Peki bowed.
A walking tree.
“A Treant. When the landfolk burned too much and cut down too many of their kin, they left the shores. But still, they walk the oceans deep. So few left.”
The [Sailors] saluted, the [Pirates] and Drowned Folk stared. The old world walked. And it turned its head, staring up at the small ships above. The Treant walked on. Guardian, tending to life. In any form.
How long Wil stood there he couldn’t have known. But the moment left an impact on him. A sight rare even for those at sea. And for the first time—he thought it might be okay. Even if he had no treasure.
Because—this was an adventure.

The 8th Location
 
So it was that The Emerald Signet parted ways with the somewhat honorable [Pirates]. A legend in her own right.
They left behind a memory of a seeing a legend of nature. A Goblin ship. A battle with the undead at sea.
Wil even thought he was close to leveling. But mostly—he was happy now. Content. He lounged around the boat as Inky and some of the [Divers] went exploring.
“This might be the shipwreck spot, Lord Kallinad. But the location was somewhat unclear. We’ll look around. After that, I might trouble you for another game of your damn chess. We’ll break out the hooks too. Even days after they pass, there’s good fishing in a Treant’s wake.”
Captain Lasc was speaking cheerfully as he stood at the prow of the ship. Wil was nodding and smacking his lips, thinking of fresh fish. The other students were laughing as Merrik read an ode to Feshi and she rolled her eyes. He was still trying.
It was an inauspicious moment. But even so—the diver’s bell came up as someone ran the rope connected to the bell. Wil and Lasc turned.
“Any news, Inky?”
Wil saw the [Storm Sailor] stumble out of the sealed diving bell. The part-Octopus woman stared around. And then she looked at Wil.
“Mister Wil? We found something. We’re bringing it up.”
Wil blinked.
“What?”
It was so sudden. So—casual. Inky pointed. Her eyes were wide.
“It wasn’t touched. And it were right there. Out in the open. Amid the bones. It’s…a chest.”
“What?”
The [Storm Captain] stared. Wil’s friends turned. Yerranola laughed, disbelieving.
“What? Did she just say…? No way.”
They stared as shouting broke out from the side. And then—ropes were being lowered. Something rose over the side of the ship, covered in seaweed. Water spilled around it as it was lowered.
A gigantic, magnificent chest. Inscribed with some sigils covered in muck. Wil stared. Inky pointed.
“It was just…there.”
The students stared. Venaz stood up as Lasc strode over.
“That’s…”
“Dead gods. No way.”
“Wil? That’s not real, is it? Someone’s playing a prank. Right? Right?”
Yerranola looked around. But Wil was frozen solid. And Venaz was chuckling too. He strode over, glancing at Inky.
