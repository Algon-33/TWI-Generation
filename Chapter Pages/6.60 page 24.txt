Ryoka was staring down at the names. Fierre didn’t understand what her fascination was with a group of Bronze-rank Humans. But then…she waited, watching Ryoka’s face. Hearing her blood flow accelerate. Fierre licked her lips and then caught herself.
At last, Ryoka Griffin looked up. She stared at Fierre, and then put down the paper. She looked at it again, but then slid it over to Fierre.
“Later. I’ll deal with it later. You know, the Pithfire Hounds are at Madain’s inn. And I said I’d try to be back. Fierre, it’s good to see you.”
“You too, Ryoka.”
The Vampire girl grinned. Ryoka smiled and then hesitated. She looked sidelong at Fierre.
“Do you want to go back and have a drink? Talk some more? Can Vampires even get drunk?”
The Vampire girl grinned wickedly.
“Want to find out?”
Then her face fell. She hesitated and Fierre looked towards the door.
“Oh, but I don’t like drinking in crowds. I mean, I would, but with the teeth…”
Ryoka paused. She looked at Fierre as the girl—who was older than her, in fact—sighed. Longingly. Fierre had a wistful look in her eyes. And Ryoka thought of her friends.
Erin. Mrsha. Ceria. Yvlon? Fals. Garia. She had left them all behind. But now, here, she had more friends.
Wiskeria. Alevica? But surely, Charlay. And Levil and his team. Lupp. But her first friend, the person she’d found herself missing because they understood each other sat right here.
Fierre. Ryoka had missed her friend. And she hadn’t known until recently what it was like to miss someone like that. You couldn’t miss what you’d never had. Now, though, she sat back down and put her bare feet up on Fierre’s desk. The Vampire girl stared at them.
“Your feet are incredibly dirty, Ryoka.”
“Sorry.”
Ryoka didn’t take them down. She grinned at Fierre and gestured around the sealed and warded room.
“You don’t like drinking in public? Let’s drink in your new office, then. That’s got to be the most private place in the world.”
Fierre blinked.
“But I work here!”
“So? You own this place now, right? Why not? Unless Vampires can’t get drunk?”
The broker blinked. But then she grinned wickedly, with all her teeth. It was a smile like a Drake’s, but this one was reassuring.
“Oh, we can. It’s just a bit harder. And I know a good spot. Want to grab a bottle?”
“Sure. And let’s say hi to the Pithfire Hounds. You can meet Mousey. The dog.”
Ryoka stood up. Fierre walked over to the door and held it open. She looked at Ryoka and the City Runner looked around as a cool wind blew in from Reizmelt. She sighed as she looked at Fierre.
“It’s good to be back.”
