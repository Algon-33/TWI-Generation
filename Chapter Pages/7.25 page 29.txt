Magic. Just like that. She grabbed the cure, cradled it. And looked up at a wish-granting Dragon.
“Please? Can’t you make it three? Three’s…an auspicious number. A trinity. A—isn’t it traditional?”
“No.”
“But it’s so easy for you. This—this will cure Fierre? Of her sickness?”
The Dragon hesitated.
“The symptoms, at least. But of course. The sickness is just a symptom of—”
He paused. Too late. Ryoka leapt to her feet.
“Of what? Blood? A plague?”
“Nothing. I know nothing I care to share, mortal.”
The Dragon turned his head, trying to pretend innocence. Ryoka strode up to him.
“Tell me! They’re sick! Dying!”
“Perhaps that is well. Vampires ruled over Izril during their time. Interference—”
Ryoka kicked him. She jumped forwards and kicked the Dragon on the hind leg. It was like a mad Chihuahua charging an elephant. Teriarch looked affronted as Ryoka punched him.
“You. Have. To. Help! Why won’t you just do it? Lift one claw? You could make it all better! I don’t understand why—”
He lifted a claw. And gently smushed her. Ryoka was pinned under one claw. She tried to move, struggled, cursed—then just lay there, panting.
“I told you. I am done with interfering. I could tell you. But then I would begin the Nights of Blood again. [Vampire Hunters] would come from Terandria. Izril would lie in fear. I am tired. Every time I interfere, I cause ripples. A Dragon cannot lightly change history. We are too powerful.”
The City Runner panted.
“It’s not fair.”
“No.”
The Dragon sighed. Both lay there, powerless for different reasons. At last, Ryoka sat up.
“You’re really not going to help me. Even if I beg?”
“Not in the way you wish. Not with earthshattering might or artifacts that will change destiny. If I gave you a ring, it would eventually come back to me. And the people of this world still remember how to slay Dragons. Girl. Why do you think I hide?”
The Dragon informed her sternly. Ryoka sighed. Round and round they went. If only—
“Fine. Get off me. Please.”
The Dragon raised one claw. Ryoka rolled over. And rolled over again. She bumped into the table without bothering to get up. The Dragon eyed the young woman pillbugging across the cave. She really was depressed. But he knew he was right. He tried to justify himself—just because.
“It is not personal, Ryoka Griffin. If I gave you a magical sword—I wouldn’t make you a hero. That creates monsters, more than great [Kings]. It is not good to give mortals everything, you see. You rely on the artifact or my help. It is not…good for you. You understand?”
“Mhm.”
Ryoka’s hair hung around her face. She pulled the laptop off the table, hit the power button. It still had power. She’d had it charged. She sat with her back to him. The Dragon went on, edging around to glance at her face, but it was bowed too low.
“In the same way, I do not leave my cave. I am a prisoner as well. It is too risky. Hence, my isolation and slumber. I understand your grief. No one is without shackles.”
“Yeah.”
The screen was on. Ryoka keyed in Kevin’s passcode. It was his computer. She just sat there as the Dragon went on, pontificating about ethics. It wasn’t easy for him. He felt for her—was she listening? He poked her back.
“I hear you. Shut up.”
The young woman sat there. So the Dragon wouldn’t do anything for her. Fine. Fine.
Fine. No, this is fine. She would have preferred to be incinerated. But at least this.
Route Z. Ryoka looked up at the Dragon. And she had to say it, as Kevin’s stupid computer loaded. Processing power of 2.2 GHz, 6 GB RAM.
