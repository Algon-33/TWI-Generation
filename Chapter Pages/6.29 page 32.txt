Wearily, relieved, the Free Queen waved a feeler. She looked at Garry. A month or two ago she would have never said more than a few words to him. Now, she spoke to him. On occasion. She knew his name. Because of the Worker gently humming below her. She put Bird down. She had hoped he would hear the answer. Feared it.
“You may go, Garry. Bring Bird a snack. An Ashfire Bee if one is left.”
“Or a bird.”
“Or a bird.”
“Yes, my Queen.”
Garry sketched a bow. Then he hesitated. He turned back and hesitantly looked at the Free Queen. She, sending a mental order, did not miss the gesture. She looked back.
“Soldiers. Escort. Garry. Speak.”
Two of the Soldiers stationed at the entrance to the chambers left at a trot. Garry looked up at the Free Queen. And then he spoke.
“My Queen. Forgive me. But will you tell me the answer to your question? What is the purpose of the Antinium?”
He waited. Then he flinched as the Queen looked down at him. Her huge head bent. And her voice was very quiet.
“Return to the blighted lands. Destroy the thing that lurks in the darkness. Return and bring death to the deathless one. Destroy all that lives on Rhir and render it to dust. Avenge, revenge the Antinium. For her. For her memory, and in her name. That is the purpose the Antinium have. The purpose that burns in the hearts of the Prognugators and the Queens. It should be your existence. But it is not.”
Garry stumbled back. The Free Queen looked at him.
“You cannot hear it. Though I roar the name in my mind, Garry the [Cook]. And though you do not mean it, you offend me.”
“I—I am sorry, my Queen.”
“For what? You were not created properly. You are a failure. The fault is not yours.”
The Free Queen straightened abruptly. Garry spoke again.
“That was what you told us.”
“That was why Pawn was sad.”
Bird spoke up. The Free Queen looked at them.
“It is the truth. You two are failures. For all you are Individual.”
“But I thought—aren’t we what the Free Antinium set out to create, my Queen? Individuals? That is what Revalantor Klbkch claims.”
The Free Queen mulled over the statement.
“Klbkch speaks a half-truth. We set out to create Individuals. But I would rather have created True Antinium. Because Individuals shape the Hive. But the True Antinium are all Antinium.”
“And what separates them from us? Hearing? Listening with the mind?”
Garry’s voice shook. As if the denial of his purpose had shaken him. Bird just rocked back and forth. Back and forth. The Queen’s voice was flat.
“Yes. There have always been Soldiers. Always Workers. They did not look like you. They were…far different. But they fulfilled the same tasks. And no matter how they looked, they were Antinium. Because they were part of the Hive. I had only to think, and that will would be carried out. The Antinium were not separate, but one mind. A Queen was but one part of a whole. A Soldier a limb. We were together. We never marched alone.”
“I am with Garry. We are not alone.”
Bird spoke up, almost defiantly. The Free Queen shook her head.
“Little Bird. You do not understand. Tell me. Do you think the Soldiers who guard this Hive are strong?”
The question made Bird and Garry look at each other. Both nodded. The Queen laughed and it was a hollow sound.
