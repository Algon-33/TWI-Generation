Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 41
The half-Elf shouted. Yerzhen looked at him.
“What?”
“The foreign [Knight]—”
There was no time to explain. Nor did the Bear of Ailendamus wait for a response. He just growled.
“Tell me later! I’ll murder whoever started this! First I’ll break all the bones in their bodies!”
He charged towards the [Knights] with a roar. The half-Elf [Captain] knew where to go. Not after the [General].
“You lot! With me!”
He roared. Two squads of the Bear Brawlers raced after him towards the interrogation tent, the only conceivable place where they would take the Goblin Slayer. He was going to murder whoever was in charge, probably the [Mage], Telich, who liked to skim money—
The [Soldiers] burst into the tent and saw a dozen bodies on the floor. Dead. They stared at the figure in armor. He was flexing his hands. And—he had a sword in his hand. He’d been adding a throwing axe and a buckler to one arm. Daggers to his belt.
The emotionless visor swung around as the [Captain] and the [Soldiers] stopped. The [Knight] looked at them.
“Goblin Slayer.”
“No.”
The figure leapt. The half-Elf put up his fists. He was a [Brawler], who could fight with bare hands or street weapons as well as a sword! He lashed out—
“[Mach Punch]!”
The [Knight] caught the fist. He seemed as surprised as the half-Elf. The [Captain] tried to pull back—

Rabbiteater adjusted his grip, and flung the half-Elf by his arm through the air. He was pretty sure he’d broken the man’s wrist.
But he hadn’t killed him. The first few punches he had—even without meaning it. He was—stronger. Faster! Incomparably so. The [Soldiers] stared.
Rabbiteater nearly drew the sword—but something in him told him.
Punch. He made a fist, stepped in—and one of the men collapsed, eyes rolled up in his head. His jaw might have been broken, but he was alive.
The second slashed with a sword. He saw the [Knight] make a claw out of his right hand—he slashed through the sword.
“Impossible—”
Rabbiteater was impressed too. He looked at his claws, sharper than steel. Then he turned.
Somehow—it had been Erin. He didn’t know how. But—
The camp was in chaos. The [Knights] were fighting. But the [General]—Rabbiteater turned as he heard the familiar roar. He began to run.
Two more men went down, punched into tomorrow by a single blow. The [Knights] were hemmed in, fighting once more.
A repeat of this morning. The [General] kicked one in the chest plate and caved it in. Markus grabbed his comrade—then they spotted the [Knight] who’d stopped.
A half-Elf was on his feet. His right arm hung broken, the wrist’s bone snapped. But his left hand was raised.
“Enough.”
The other [Soldiers] held back. Was that—? They stared at the [Captain of Fists] as he and the strange Ser Solstice squared off. The [Knight] took a step—
[Flicker Step]! [Minotaur Punch]! [Double Strike]! [Enhanced Impact]! 
It was a step and haymaker punch. The kind the [Captain] had used to fell [Knights] in actual battle. It caught the [Knight] off-guard.
The fist crashed against the jawline of his helm. The [Soldiers] cheered. There was no stopping that! He might be d—
The second punch broke the half-Elf’s jaw. The [Captain] nearly dropped. He sagged, his jaw hanging loose.
General Yerzhen turned.
“Ulne?”
The [Knight] saw the [Captain] swing again. He had a tenacity to match a Redfang. But he was slow—Rabbiteater hesitated. His strength—
“Protect the [Captain]!”
[Soldiers] of Ailendamus, good [Soldiers], grabbed the half-Elf and dragged him back. He was out almost before they caught him. The others spread out.
