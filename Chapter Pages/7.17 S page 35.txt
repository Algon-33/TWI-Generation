The Drake popped out of his seat. And everyone turned to look at him. Saliss struck a pose. Xrn stared at him.
“You are naked. Fascinating. I know you.”
The [Alchemist] grinned. He felt every single potion on his person. Ready to throw, or detonate.
It would be—
“Sorry, I didn’t want to slow your roll. It’s just—I have a question.”
“Yes? Ask.”
The Drake spread his arms.
“Is it war? I’m asking for a friend.”
A pause. And then—laughter. Everyone laughed at that, with nervousness, and then—relief. Saliss grinned. But he never took his eyes off Xrn.
And she? She smiled. And then she laughed. And it was a strange, fluttering, alien sound. Insectile. It made the laughter stop. And the Small Queen looked at Saliss. And she replied.
“Silly little Drake. The question is not yes or no. The question is: with whom? Because we never stopped.”
Erin looked at Xrn. And Saliss nodded. He walked out of that inn. And back towards Pallass. And he said only one word.
“Alas.”

This was the end of it. It began with a fall. And ended with a conversation. A female Drake sat next to a bedside. She had pink and blue scales.
Rose and cobalt. She looked at the old Drake. And he looked past her.
“Hey, Chaldion. Will you look at me?”
He made no answer. He didn’t look at her. Or respond.
The Drake sat there. Too afraid to try and touch him. Too proud to walk away and deny the truth for his reality.
It felt like they had been sitting like this forever. But this was the first time. But it had always been like this. One refusing to give. And the other trapped.
It could have lasted this way forever, without changing. But—Onieva spoke.
“She’s a Level 40 [Magical Innkeeper]. And she has two Skills I’ve never seen before called [Immortal Moment] and [Wondrous Fare]. Lots of combat Skills for an [Innkeeper]. Weird spread.”
Chaldion jerked. His eye moved and then found the female Drake’s face. He opened his mouth. And she spoke before he could. She produced a jar of glowing green acid and stared at it. A gift from an inn.
“Sometimes I wonder if she’s on our side. I like her. I think she’s a good person. But I don’t know. And sometimes…I wonder. People say such things.”
The two looked at each other. Onieva twirled the jar of acid on one claw, caught it as it wobbled. The [Strategist] just looked at her.
“When we get down to it, Chaldion, are we on the same side? Because we’re both Drakes of Pallass. If I’m not, let me know and I can be the monster I think I am.”
She showed him the glowing jar. The [Strategist] made no sound. Onieva tossed it up, caught it. And then—the jar vanished into the bag of holding. She went on, tired. Uncertain.
“Xrn, the Small Queen is in her inn. She wants to talk to Erin.”
A sound. The two Drakes looked at each other. Chaldion opened his mouth.
Onieva leaned forwards. She stared into Chaldion’s eyes. Her mouth opened, closed. She searched for words but none came around the pit in her stomach. At last, she asked, with all the feeling in her.
“Who is she?”
Chaldion stared at her. He stared at Onieva, through her, away. His one good eye jerked backwards, dancing away. But she was there. He looked back at the two eyes, staring. Waiting.
And he said nothing, for so long. His mouth stayed closed. But there was no immortal moment. Forever was too short. And they had so little time.
At last, the old Drake replied. Slowly, each word coming out slowly. As he met the eyes and looked away and back.
And away again.
“I don’t know. Someday, I will find out whether she’s ally or foe or something in between.”
