“Low-leveled for now—who cares? I knew the two smiths that were here. The one Salazsar stole was Level 41. The other was Level 48. He died of old age, but both were old, for Drakes. The boy is still young. He could make it to Level 50. Or even higher. It took me eighty years, but I had time. And I won’t grow any higher. I think. No longer.”
Erin’s breath caught. Pelt held out one arm. Thick muscle, still frostbitten, flexed as he held out something to her.
Her knife. The metal had somehow not shattered despite the cold. Pelt looked at it. And then he held it out to her.
“I am one of this world’s best smiths. There are older. And better. But I have given nearly a century to my craft. Once, they called me a master and I forged the like of this each day! My team and I represented Dwarven craft! Even now few of my kind could surpass me! All but him, and the old grandfathers! I can still forge even the rarest metals! Even now!”
His voice shook with pride. Erin looked at the small knife in his hands. The Dwarf stared at the bared metal.
“But. I made a mistake. We all did. In our arrogance we—he—we committed a grave sin. For the steel was impure. As impure as our hearts. And for that, we incurred a debt. So heavy, I cannot pay it. And we left our home. I shall never go back. Never reclaim my pride.”
Water ran from his eyes. Pelt dropped to one knee.
“Never again, never again. But for one moment—”
He stared at the fading blue flame. Memory. It burned regret. A skeleton’s death. Tears stood out in Pelt’s eyes. He looked at his work, and at Erin. He offered her the knife and she took it.
“I made an error no one would forgive me for. So I left in disgrace. I will not go back home ever again. What more is there to say?”
“I’m sorry.”
“I know. And I remembered my pride. Twice now, you’ve uncovered it.”
The Dwarf shook his head. He laughed, bitterly, with more pain than Erin wanted to hear. He shook his head, turning away. The blue flame was dying. Only a spark remained.
“Your flame hurts my heart, girl. Take it away. And leave. Please.”
He knelt in his frost-covered forge, the tears of ice running and freezing. Erin looked at him. This wasn’t what she’d wanted. Pelt clutched at his heart.
“I’m—”
But he knew that. Erin stepped backwards, holding the kitchen knife. No. She wanted him to smile. But her flame was only sorrow. She turned away, tears springing into her own eyes.
“Erin Solstice.”
The young woman turned. And the Dwarven [Blacksmith], kneeling on the ground met the [Innkeeper]’s eyes.
“My craft. The art of it thanks you.”
He bowed his head. And she bowed back. Erin walked backwards. And she stared around. At staring smiths. At a forge where frost did not melt in the summer’s light. At people, staring at a legend from Liscor that had stepped into Pallass.
But she wasn’t happy. Erin Solstice shook her head, brushing at her tears.
“What a terrible Skill. What a horrible, cursed…why do I have it?”
She clenched her fists. But then she remembered Pelt’s tears. She looked back. And the smith was rising. He stood, his back straight and looked at Erin.
Perhaps—
Erin Solstice turned. And she heard a click. It was soft, metallic. Erin felt something cool on her wrists. She looked around.
“Got her!”
A pair of Drakes sighed in relief. Erin stared at her manacled hands. Then at the squad of [Guards] dressed in the yellows of Pallass’ City Watch. One of the Drakes shouted.
