But he had his pride. Somehow. The Dwarf stumbled out of Esthelm to find more drink.
He came upon the statue of the [Florist] amid people nodding to him. The drunk Dwarf stared up at it.
Flowers. They put flowers here. Grew them, rather, in a little garden around the [Florist]’s feet. Someone had worked hard on this, replacing Skills with effort.
The hero of Esthelm, who had apparently saved the city. Along with Goblins. Even the sculptor hadn’t added Goblins in. But the names were here. Somehow, found.
That…those ones had been here. Pelt saw the connection.
“Numbtongue.”
His fingers touched carven stone. There was the name. And he recalled the blade he’d made.
“Fat lot of good it did. Should have made armor. Beautiful stuff. Scale mail—no, something lighter. Mithril woven fibers. An apron of the stuff. Hah! Hahaha—she would have worn that. Now that…that would have been a masterpiece.”
His Drake apprentice, Emessa, found the old Dwarf giggling to himself, lying amid the flowers.
“Master Pelt—Master Pelt, people are staring. This is a statue—”
“I’m just resting. Why are you here? The forge is empty!”
The Dwarf swiped at her. The apprentice carefully dodged; he was fearsomely strong and wouldn’t hurt her on purpose, but he forgot his strength. He could probably uproot the statue by himself.
“Master Pelt, let’s get you home. I’ll get you whatever you want. But please, have some water? Something to eat? Have you eaten?”
“Mithril apron. No, something more subtle. Dye it. Infuse a flexible alloy so it looks like a damned apron. Miniature runes on the inside. That’s what you’d need. And it wouldn’t stop an arrow to the face. That would be craft, though. Beyond me. I’m not a damn [Seamstress]. But it would be something, eh?”
She didn’t know what he was babbling about.
“Yes, Master Pelt. Master Pelt…”
He sat in the kitchen as she ran to get food from an inn. Pelt sat there.
“Wasn’t even a great blade for the Hobgoblin. Good—solid Dragonblood crystal. Cuts beautifully, but it won’t last a decade. Weapon for a Goblin, really. It’ll keep cutting as it breaks off. But I could do better.”
“Yes, Master Pelt.”
He was still babbling when she came back. Extremely drunk—she offered him some soup. He gulped it down and exhaled.
“I used to make great blades.”
“You are, Master Pelt. Tomorrow we have to get to work.”
“Yes. Tomorrow. But I used to make even better blades. I’m teaching you the secrets of Mithril. ‘Dwarfsteel’, you fools call it. What did that boy, Kevin, call it? Titanium? He knew some metals…but there is craft beyond that.”
The Drake stopped. She looked at him. He grinned at her hungry expression.
“Yes. There is. Is the adamantium here?”
Slowly, Emessa put down the food.
“The Drakes from Salazsar actually brought some, Master Pelt. But you’re drunk—”
The Dwarf wasn’t listening. His eyes were far away.
“There was a time I never touched drink. When I aspired to best what that brat, Dawil, held. But it wasn’t just me. Pallass…is Maughin still working?”
“He’s done good work, Master Pelt. But he misses you.”
Emessa had visited her home quite often thanks to the door. Pelt shook his head.
“He’s young. Good, but alone. No competition. The ‘best’ in Pallass without me. They must be looking for another smith.”
“They are, Master Pelt. Will you have some fries? You do like them…”
She offered the snack food. Pelt munched, talking as she plied him with water.
“Maughin now. He has potential. But I’d never make him my apprentice. Even though he asked. Four times.”
