Interlude – A Meeting of [Druids]
Page 26
Erin looked around. She counted. Problems 1-3 looked at her expectantly and Lyonette blew out her cheeks. Erin nodded at last.
“Okay. I guess that’s okay. #1. You’re not done.”
She pointed two fingers at her eyes and then at Mrsha. The Gnoll child gulped. Shassa exhaled in relief. Nalthaliarstrelous nodded.
“Good. Then we shall confer among ourselves.”
He beckoned. Shassa and Mrsha walked off after him. Erin blocked them.
“Hold it. Mrsha’s staying here.”
The two adult [Druids] looked at her.
“But she is one of us.”
“Oh no.”
Lyonette scooped up Mrsha. The Gnoll fought her, squirming to get free. Nalthaliarstrelous looked at Erin.
“She is of our class. But she does not know our role. She must come with us. I thought she had a teacher. She does not.”
“Yeah, but…how about no? You two can talk. Mrsha, stay here.”
The [Innkeeper] blocked Nalthaliarstrelous. The [Druid]’s eyes flicked to Mrsha. She was squirming to get free. She wanted to know what they had to say! Lyonette threatened her.
“Mrsha…”
“Let her go.”
The [Druid] slowly raised his staff. Erin raised a fist. Teriarch raised a hand.
“[Druids] do not break their word lightly. Let them walk in the garden with the child. She will not come to harm among her peers.”
Erin blinked. She turned.
“Eldavin? When did you get here?”
The Dragon sat at his leisure. He nodded at Nalthaliarstrelous. The [Druid] bowed deeply. Shassa blinked, frowned at Teriarch, uncomprehending, and then hurried to copy the other [Druid]. Mrsha saw Lyonette waver.
“Excuse me, sir. But Mrsha is my child.”
“Good. Appropriate. Let her go.”
Teriarch waved a hand. Mrsha slipped out of Lyonette’s hands like grease. She landed on the floor. Lyonette spluttered.
“Excuse me!”
“Buddy, you just became #8.”
Erin warned Teriarch. He narrowed his eyes.
“I am not a number.”
“Don’t make me make you #9. Lyonette…maybe we should let Mrsha talk with these two? In the garden. They’re not going to run off. Right?”
Nalthaliarstrelous and Shassa nodded. The [Druid] murmured as Mrsha hid behind him.
“I wouldn’t need to run, anyways.”
The [Princess] glared daggers. But Mrsha scampered into the garden and the two [Druids] followed.
“Hold on! I’m not done!”
The [Princess] followed. Erin let her go. She had a feeling…Nalthaliarstrelous was hard to deal with. Momentarily lost, she had to lean on a table.
“…I’m tired. Where was I?”
A man cleared his throat.
“I believe I am next. Number 4.”
Erin looked up. She blinked at Hedault.
“Who’re you?”
The [Enchanter] nodded at Erin. Hedault, precise, hair slightly thinning on top, but pale orange. Pale-skinned from being indoors. He tapped a finger on his wrist.
“I am Hedault. [Enchanter]. We had an appointment this morning. I was approached by these two [Mages] who informed me the meeting would take place at this inn. I have little time, but I understand this is in connection with the Horns of Hammerad, as well as the House of El. So I am willing to make concessions.”
His little speech made Grimalkin reach for a second sheaf of notes. Erin just blinked.
“…Are you Ceria’s fiancé?”
Hedault looked at her. He closed his eyes. Montressa covered her face.
“No.”
“Okay. Um. Sure. #5, #6, what’s this about?”
Montressa and Beza looked at each other. Hedault’s eyes slowly turned to them and they gulped. The guests at the inn nodded approvingly. This is what they came for.
Ambiance.
