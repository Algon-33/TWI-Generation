“What? Already?”
The Selphid [Mage] bowed. His skin was pale; he wore a Gnoll’s body, incongruously enough. It was long-rotted, yellowed bones showing through parts of the skin through gaps in the robe. He smelled like mint.
“Yes. And we have word on the mold you wanted.”
“Really? From whom?”
“A representative contacted the Plain’s Eyes tribe. One of the largest Gnoll tribes in Izril.”
“Their specialty is [Shamans]. They trade the most out of any tribe with the Walled Cities and are very respected.”
Idis whispered in Geneva’s mind. The Selphid [Mage] went on.
“They’ve agreed to look for this mold. If any group could find it, or has records of a substance like that, they would.”
“Oh. I see.”
Geneva sighed. But that was replaced almost at once by concern.
“Does this—Joseph know about…?”
“All he has been told is that someone from Earth wishes to speak with him secretly. He has been told Wistram is untrustworthy. Our agent will have explained.”
“She’s a Gold-rank, as well as a [Mage], Geneva. Ulinde. But she’s trustworthy. I’ll tell you more about her if you like.”
Idis spoke helpfully. Geneva bit her lip. She hadn’t expected it to work so fast. But she made up her mind in an instant.
“I need to decontaminate. Let me scrub. Meet me in the United Nations headquarters in twenty minutes. Please get Paige, Kirana, Daly, Luan, Ken—anyone you can find. Tell this Joseph we want to speak with him. No—wait.”
She stopped the [Mage] as he raised a finger to his temple. The Selphid looked inquisitively at Geneva. The [Doctor] closed her eyes and thought.
“Don’t tell them about us. Just say—it’s me.”

Joseph sat in a room with Jelaqua and Ulinde. No Lyonette. Or Numbtongue. Especially no Mrshas. Not because they weren’t trustworthy. But because…this was a conversation between people from Earth.
So, Joseph turned her head towards Ulinde.
“What’re they telling you? Are we talking in person or what? I can get uh…me, if we need to talk.”
Ulinde looked at ‘Joseph’. Erin sat there, nervous, but her face was determined. Jelaqua eyed her; Erin looked more serious than either Selphid usually saw her.
“I think it’s just [Messages], Erin. They’re getting set up. You’re—oh. You’re talking with, um, Geneva Scala. The Last Light of Baleros, apparently.”
“What? Who? That’s a weird name. The last light of what?”
Erin frowned. Ulinde explained.
“I’ve heard of her, actually. She’s this legend on the battlefield! A—a healer. No, wait. What was her class? Oh. They said. She’s a [Doctor].”
“ A doctor?”
Erin sat up. Her eyes widened.
“What’s special about a [Doctor], Erin? I thought they were weirdoes, like [Saw Doctors] who cut people open when there’s no medicine. Selphids make use of them sometimes, but they’re rare.”
The young woman looked at Jelaqua and shook her head.
“No, Jelaqua! What? A [Doctor] is…a [Healer]. But better. They don’t use magic. They use medicine. Science. Is this person really a doctor-doctor?”
“I have no idea. Let me ask. Hold on…”

“You’ve got Joseph? Really?”
Daly panted as he slammed into the small room. He saw a Selphid [Mage], Geneva, and the other leaders of the company turn to him. Siri raised a finger, but there was no need.
“I am sending [Message] spells. Our agent does not know [Speak].”
The [Mage] informed the others. Geneva nodded tightly. The others were looking at her.
“Tell them it’s just me. Geneva Scala. I am a [Doctor]. From Earth.”
“But don’t say it as a class. She’s actually a doctor. A medical one, who was trained. There’s a difference.”
