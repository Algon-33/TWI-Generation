For a moment, Erin thought it was Maviola speaking. But it was Olesm. The [Strategist] looked at her. He was waiting for news of Maviola. So was Erin. He feared the worst. To distract himself, he looked at Erin.
“You need to take precautions. No one will forget…this.”
He waved at the scrying mirror, recapping events again and again, getting perspectives. Like Menolit, speaking to Noass on the streets of Liscor.
I was there. I fought! Erin smiled briefly. Newsworthy. She looked back at Olesm and smiled a bit. Not with happiness. But resolve.
“That’s fine. Because I’ll do it again. Again, and again. Only next time—I’ll do it better. I’ll build a bigger inn. Find more people. Get stronger. Make sure no one has to die next time.”
He nodded slowly. Olesm looked at Erin, as so many tended to do now and then. Now and then.
“No one could have done that alone. Not Saliss, or Maviola, or Ryoka or…”
He gestured at her. Erin sighed. Why did everyone give her so much credit?
“And I didn’t do all of it. Not by a long shot! Who were those [Witches]? I didn’t ask the Couriers—The Wandering Inn isn’t capable of making miracles.”
He clearly didn’t agree with that. Erin paused. The [Innkeeper] went on, after a moment.
“…Alone. What I mean is…that wasn’t my run. I wasn’t Ryoka. But here—”
She looked around. At her guests, towards the future, and then back at Olesm. The [Innkeeper] pointed down at her feet.
“Here. The adventure begins here.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I think that’ll do. More to come. More events after this one. But here we are.
Longer than I thought. 5-8,000 words longer, honestly. I thought there wasn’t much more to write. But drama…
Well, I hope it was satisfactory. Not happy, since that’s not exactly what I was going for. But complete. Fulfilling even if you’re upset.
Thus…might end the long chapters. For now. You can see why I put so much into them. And perhaps I can rest myself. I’m tired.
This is not the end of Volume 7. Not yet. But…we’ll see. Thanks for reading.
 
The art for this chapter is going to be nostalgic. The Necromancer and a certain trio on patrol by Anna! Also, Ryoka Griffin by Juliette Taka. Finally, and perhaps inappropriately? The Horns of Hammerad by Seenkay for their critical part in the chapter! Give them all lots of love!
