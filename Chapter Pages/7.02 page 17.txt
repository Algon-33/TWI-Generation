After five minutes in here, Erin realized why this was called the ‘punishment cell’. She hadn’t really understood it at first, but it was a punishment. More than being locked in a cell with some [Murderer]. You see, that would have been cruelty. Torture. Or just plain old murder since you’d be in the cell with…a [Murderer].
But this? This was punishment. Erin had tried to ignore the Drake when she realized he was naked. But he kept bothering her. And throwing things at her. And refusing to leave her alone. She didn’t want to give him the satisfaction, but…he was annoying.
“You know, you’re being quite rude. Here I am, trying to introduce myself, and you won’t even talk to me. Or look me in the eye.”
The Drake sighed as he leaned against his cell bars. Erin stared at him.
“Me? Rude? You’re the one with no clothes on!”
“And you’re the one looking. So why is this my fault? I’m not trying to offend you.”
The Drake’s voice was reasonable, plaintive. And—Erin heard the note of humor he was suppressing. She glared at him, but she was drawn into this stupid argument already.
“Why—you’re naked! That’s disgusting! You’re all offense! Stop waving that thing at me!”
“What? I’m not waving anything, Miss Human. And whatever offense you might be taking—there’s not much of it to go around! It’s tiny! And it’s not going to get bigger, trust me.”
The Drake gestured. Erin closed her eyes. The pebble bounced off her stomach. She made an inarticulate sound.
“Stop that! Or I’ll throw that through your face!”
“Come on. Let’s talk.”
“Not until you put something on!”
“Okay, okay, fine.”
Erin opened her eyes. She stared at the Drake. And then the pillow covering his crotch. Erin saw him grin.
“Don’t you have any clothes?”
“Nope.”
“Put the blanket on!”
“No. I’m making a concession with the pillow. It’s a pain to hold here. I—whoops.”
He dropped the pillow. Erin tried to unsee, but it was too late. The Drake bent and tried to pick the pillow up.
“Stop. Just—stop.”
“Hey you’re the one with the problem here. Not me. If you’re so upset, give me your pants! I’ll wear them!”
The Drake waved the pillow at Erin huffily. She stared at him. After a second she covered the lower half of his body with one hand. It wasn’t that Erin wanted to look, but she couldn’t help it.
“I get why this is called the punishment cell. Will you leave me alone?”
“Absolutely not. This is the most fun I’ve had all day. Hey, I have the pillow back on.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“I’m trying! Look, I’ll hold the pillow here. If I lean against the cell—no, wait, there it goes again.”
“Please stop.”
The Human and Drake stared at each other from their cells. Erin tried to reappraise the Drake. Aside from the obvious…well, he was male. And naked. But Erin couldn’t help but feel like they’d met. What a thought!
But—hold on. Erin vaguely remembered this Drake. Somehow. He was eying her and clearly he had no idea who she was, but—
“Hold on. You’re that nude guy!”
“I am? I mean, I am. I prefer ‘all-natural’, but go on. Have we met?”
“No. Yes. I mean, I was in the bar and you were getting arrested.”
“Ah. That happens a lot. Which time was this?”
“Like…a long time ago. Are you—no—why are you naked? Please tell me that.”
“Well, it just so happens that I was arrested. And the [Guards] didn’t give me any clothes.”
“Really?”
The Drake sighed.
“Well, they offered, but I refused. You know how it is.”
“You got arrested for being naked.”
Erin spoke flatly. The Drake glared at her above her protective hand. He tried to rattle the bars of his cell, but they were too well-made for that.
