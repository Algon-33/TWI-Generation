“Stay with the [Archers]. This isn’t the Sedfast war. I won’t lose you or let you rush into them. Besides—the Antinium tunnel. Guard our flanks.”
Maviola bit her lip. But she acquiesced. The air burst into fire around her. Erin saw her pointing.
“[Archers], take my fire!”
“Prepare to charge! Raise the banners!”
Lord Dallien shouted. Magnolia Reinhart joined the [Lords] preparing to charge, despite the objections of the others. Her face was white with fear. But what a brave girl. 
“She’s a lot younger.”
Erin remarked. The world froze over. Maviola turned her head, stepped out of her body. She blinked.
“We broke the backs of the Antinium this day. The first Antinium war. I thought they were but monsters until I came here. I still did—but your memory—can we go to it?”
Erin raised her hands. Concentrated.
Flicker. The flame turned blue again.
They looked down at Skinner. Maviola stared about her at the Antinium, fighting the undead.
“Where are you?”
“Inside. Playing chess.”
“Chess?”
“It was an [Immortal Moment]. So—so I could get over my fear of Skinner.”
“I see. Look at that monster.”
Maviola spat. The spit flickered out of existence. She narrowed her eyes, shook her head.
“They all died.”
“Four lived.”
Erin looked at Knight. The dying chess club. She reached out. But she hadn’t touched him, so her hand passed through this memory. She shook her head.
“Stop. I want to stop.”
“Yes. This is—too much.”
The fire grew dimmer. Maviola let go of Erin’s hands.
The memory vanished. The immortal moment ended. Erin sat in the inn, across from Maviola as the woman withdrew her hands. Erin blinked. Her face was wet. With tears?
She touched her face. Maviola blinked at her, wide-eyed. Whatever the two had expected—it was not this. They looked at each other, having seen through each other’s eyes. Erin touched the wetness on her cheeks. She stared at Maviola.
“…Did you just spit on me?”
“Oops.”

“You’re not from here. I didn’t think you were Izrilian or Terandrian. But that proves it. I saw into your mind, Erin.”
“Uh oh. Please don’t tell anyone.”
Erin sat with Maviola after a handkerchief and water had been applied. Maviola looked at her.
“Don’t worry. I don’t have long left.”
Erin had seen that too. She stared as Maviola produced a viridian vial.
“Two more weeks to go.”
“That’s terrible. Can’t you get more?”
“Do you have tens of thousands of gold pieces? And does Saliss have the ability to produce a Potion of Youth each week?”
Maviola smiled at Erin and shrugged.
“It’s fine.”
“No, it’s not. You shouldn’t die! You’re just going to live for two more weeks and then fall over dead?”
The young woman was horrified. In that way—she understood Maviola’s feelings. How not when she had seen her memories? But she was not Maviola and the idea was anathema.
Maviola was sanguine.
“It’s a beautiful ending. Fire should burn out fast, not die as an ember. I’ve made my peace with it. And as I said—I have something to do. Teach you.”
She pointed at Erin’s chest. The [Innkeeper] blinked.
“Teach me what?”
“Fire! And offer you bits of advice. You’re like me. A firekeeper. We tend to people. We try to make the world better. That’s the role of the nobility. Or it was. Magnolia, Tyrion—all these hotheads are better suited to war. But you? Look what you’ve made!”
She spread her arms to indicate the entire inn. Erin blushed.
“Nah, it wasn’t…”
The lie was too hard to utter. Maviola pointed sternly at Erin.
