Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 3)

[Mages] on Wyverns. Dozens of them this time. Lulv roared amidst the sound of fighting.
“Watch out! That Antinium Worker is doing something. Watch for that [Scout]!”
“Taken care of, sir.”
The [Battle Mage] had a lock on Maksie, who was circling, trying to unleash Olesm’s Skill and dodge. He took aim, moving as the [Wyvern Rider] angled her beast in a dive.
“[Bound Spell: Hundredfold Light Arrow Volley]. [Piercing Missiles]. [Homing—]. Hey, we’re going too fast! Pull up.”
The [Mage] snapped at the [Wyvern Rider]. Instead of replying, the Drake lolled her head at him. And he realized there was an arrow through her goggles.
“[Sniper]!”

Archer B12 lowered his bow. He drew another arrow, put it to the string, and loosed it. A second Wyvern went down.
“We killed you!”
A scream from above. He looked up and saw an Oldblood Drake coming down at him. The Worker drew a dagger in one hand and loosed a third arrow. It went through a chest.
He wasn’t as fast as Bird. A falling Drake [Mage] shouted.
“There it is! [Sniper] marked!”
More Drakes were flying at him. B12 loosed an arrow from point-blank range at an open mouth.
Ice froze his body, but the Drake died before the breath attack could fully engulf him. The cloud of mist rose overhead as the body fell back, covering him.
The Worker ran out of the cloud and loosed an arrow through a second flier.
“How is it doing that? What level is it?”
“[Appraisal]!”
The [Mage] pointed at Archer B12. The Drake’s eyes widened. He hadn’t expected to see anything, but the class—
Worker B12 saw three Drakes go down as a shower of arrows covered his position. He looked down and saw B-Team loosing arrows at his pursuers! He raised his bow, sighted on Lulv, and loosed.
The Gnoll tried to parry the arrow with the haft of his spear and grunted. It was—heavy! He still managed it.
“Kill that [Sniper]!”
“Sir! I have identification on the class!”
The [Mage] was screaming. Archer B12’s first arrow burnt away on the magic shield. The second cracked it. The Drake tried to take cover, but he kept screaming.
“It’s not a [Sniper]! Class is [Avenger]! Say again—[Av—”
The arrow went through his enchanted robes and out the other side. Lulv’s head snapped up.
What?
 
[Skill – Arrows: Combined Weight of Our Wrath]
[Legacy – Long-ranged Shot received!]
[Legacy – Pinpoint Arrows received!]
[Legacy—
 
One after the other. With each one that died, the arrows were heavier.
Never shall we forgive Hectval. Bird was right. They had all been at that inn, and the Drakes had taken it from them.
It didn’t matter if he died. B12 stood there, ignoring the arrows striking down around him. Die. We will never stop until we’re all dead. And we pass on the weight of this class to the next one.

Advanced classes. Lulv felt his skin under his fur crawling. He looked up.
Pawn. The [Priest] was watching him. But he was one of two targets shielded by the Painted Antinium. The [Mages] were preparing to destroy the entire Antinium force if they had to. If they failed, Lulv would do it for them. And he would make sure these two died.
An [Avenger] only had strength if there was someone to continue the class.
Yet the other [Priest] was raising her hands higher. Pawn held his censer.
Zimrah was bare-handed. Lulv had seen her before as well. He recognized the odd words. The chanting.
“You, Hectval, you, our enemies, are doomed to Hell. There is no salvation for you. You could have lived long—you could have lived in peace. You choose this.”
