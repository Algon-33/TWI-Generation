“Would you like food, Bird? I can bring you something…”
“No, Ishkr. I will find food if I need it.”
“Bird? Is everything…what are you doing in there?”
Selys had caught a peek of something from inside the room. Something odd. Bundles of…Bird didn’t reply.
“Bird?”
The female Drake slowly pushed open the door. And she recoiled.
“Bird? What is this?”
Ishkr walked over. Rose poked her head out of her room again. And what they saw was Bird’s room.
Bird’s…room. Always so decorated. Bird had always had, well, things pertaining to birds in here.
His feather collection. His Fortress of Fluff instead of a bed. A children’s book on birds. His arrows, tools for maintaining his bows, dead bird snacks—sometimes with wiggling worm ‘extras’.
That was what Ishkr was used to; he never cleaned the room, but sometimes he and Erin would go in and fumigate the place.
—That was not what the Gnoll saw now. Selys stopped. She stared about.
Bird’s Fortress of Fluff was gone. His collection of feathers? Gone. Everything was just bundles of…she stared.
“Sticks?”
No. She knew what they were. Some were wooden. Others tipped with steel, or iron, or bone. Some were hand-made. Others produced by experts.
They were arrows. Hundreds of arrows. Thousands of arrows. Ishkr was surprised the room hadn’t caved in from the weight.
Bird sat in the center of it, making…arrows. His bow was leaned up against one of the stacks of neatly-piled arrow shafts, tied together. Selys looked around, shocked.
“What is this, Bird?”
“My room. Which you are standing in. Hello. Goodbye.”
He did not look up from his task, carefully attaching an arrowhead to a shaft. The smell of glue was strong in the air. He was fletching with a bird’s feather.
A familiar feather. Only—it had been cut up to make the arrow’s fletching. Selys stared.
“Is that…Bevussa’s feather, Bird?”
“Yes.”
The Worker carefully attached a piece of it to the arrow. Selys stared. This was wrong. That was Bird’s favorite—
“Bird. What happened to your blankets? Your pillows? Your feather collection? Your Fortress of Fluff?”
“I sold it all. For more arrows. It is cheaper to make them.”
Bird did not look up. Ishkr looked around.
“So many.”
“I shot birds. I shot deer. I sell them and buy more arrows. It is efficient. I can buy more arrows for each one I shoot if I do not miss. Even more if the arrow does not break.”
Rose was gaping. Selys backed up.
“Bird? Why do you need all these arrows?”
Slowly, the [Bird Hunter] looked up.
“Including the arrows in my bag of holding, I have twelve thousand, eight hundred and fifteen arrows. When I have enough, or the room is full, I will go to Hectval. Then, I will shoot them.”
The three stared at Bird. Selys blinked. It was such a ludicrous statement.
“What? That’s crazy, Bird.”
“I know. I do not have enough arrows. Yet. I must have more. One for every person in Hectval. Two, perhaps. In case the first one misses.”
The Worker calmly replied. Selys looked at Ishkr. She wanted to laugh—because if she did—that meant Bird was not serious.
But he was. He carefully cut another piece off Bevussa’s feather.
“Bird. Stop. This isn’t what Erin would want.”
Rose burst out. She was nearly in tears with horror again. Bird froze at the name. Slowly, the Worker looked up.
“How do you know what Erin would want, Miss Rose? She is dead.”
“She’s not dead, Bird. She can come back.”
Selys breathed. Bird tilted his head.
