I giggle. I hear his voice.
You can’t do this. The Demons are attacking. We need to help. We need—
“Need?”
I cut him off, harshly. I spin, pointing around the room. The Blighted King has lost control. His warriors are gathered around him as he, Nereshal, and a few advisors plot feverishly. The view of the courtyard has shifted. Now I see inside corridors of the castle. It’s a maze, but the Fearless are flooding down it, cutting down servants, fighting pockets of guards.
“Do you think they have a chance? Really, Tom? They’re doomed, unless someone helps them. And we both know you’re not the man for the job.”
Don’t. You can’t!
“Can’t I?”
I raise my voice, lift the delicate fork up. People are shouting, asking their King what they should do. He’s trying to get them to shut up. What a poor [King]! Can’t he see the truth?
Stop! I won’t let you cause a massacre again! I won’t! I’d rather die!
“Sir Tom? What are you doing?”
Now Lady Zekyria is looking at me. I grin at her. She likes me. I wonder if she’ll like me after this?
Don’t hurt her! 
“Sir Tom? Are you going to fight? I believe you are needed.”
Yebior is calling out to the Blighted King. Idiot.
“My King, what should I—”
Stop! STOP!
Voices. So many voices! Too many. I raise the fork high overhead and bring it down. Onto my other hand.
“Enough!”
The tines of the fork go through my hand and hit bone. The voice in my head shuts up. I hear it scream and fade. And the room goes silent. I stand, and yank the fork out of my hand. I stare at the bent tines and try to fix one. Disappointing.
“They don’t make them like they used to. Hey there!”
The Blighted King is looking at me! I stroll over, laughing as I see his guards raising their weapons and looking uncertainly at me. I raise my hands.
“Pardon me, your Majesty. Sorry for the interruption, but I needed your attention.”
“[Clown]. What do you want?”
He stares at me. I smile at him.
“Just a word, old man. By the way, I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Tom. Pleased to meet you.”
I stick my hand in his face. He recoils. What? Oh, that’s the bloody one. How rude. The Blighted Queen hisses.
“How dare you?”
The Blighted King raises a hand, staring at me uncertainly.
“I know who you are.”
“No, you don’t.”
I wag a finger at the King and point to my chest.
“You see, you met Tom. I’m Tom. The same, but different. Better. I tell jokes. He’s one big, fat joke. And he’s taking a break so I can come out.”
“Tom—”
Richard. He pales as I swing around, grinning at him. Emily backs up.
“Richard! Hey, we never got a chance to talk. I’d love to chat, but I’m a bit busy. If you could just hold on—”
“We are wasting time. Remove him. Guards.”
Nereshal looks at me. Ooh, he’s not bothered by me at all, I can tell. I trip up the first guard who comes towards me and throw my arm around the time mage. He stiffens, but doesn’t throw me off. Maybe because of the dagger I have pressed against his throat? Now I have everyone’s attention.
“Good! I don’t want to be a bother, Mister Important Blighted Guy, but I just wanted to point something out. You’re all hot and bothered about this Demon army that appeared, but did anyone think to ask how they got here?”
Nereshal shifts. I push the dagger into his throat and he stops moving his hand oh-so-stealthily up.
“Teleportation magic—”
“Yeah, yeah. We got that the first time, old man. What I mean is, how’d they get past your special teleportation blocker? You were talking about it all day.”
“I do not know. It is here, but it isn’t working.”
