“I thought it didn’t matter! But Grimalkin is making all kinds of weights—he says they’ll be in every city—why does he have to be so smart?”
Erin threw up her hands. Mrsha and Ryoka laughed. The City Runner shook her head.
“Well, I don’t think you can stop him. And I’m staying out of his way. He looks way too smart. As for Wistram—that Palt, the Centaur seems trustworthy. I hope he is.”
“Yeah. I think…he’s a good guy.”
Erin hesitated. Palt had saved them, yesterday. With a bit of cleverness, he’d thrown all of Wistram off instantly grabbing them. She owed him big. Ryoka eyed Erin.
And she had seen the way Palt looked at Erin.
“Well, I think he appreciates you, Erin. A lot.”
Mrsha nodded. Erin hesitated.
“He’s a nice guy. I have good friends.”
The young Asian woman rolled her eyes. Was Erin doing this on purpose? She looked at Mrsha and the Gnoll gave her a look. Mrsha reached up and waved for Ryoka’s attention. Then she made a few signs.
“I don’t know what that means, Mrsha. Hm?”
Mrsha pointed at Erin. Then she made a four-legged centaur with her two paws, pretending to walk with the fingers. Then a heart-symbol. She was actually very understandable. Ryoka bent down and rubbed Mrsha’s head with her chin. Mrsha giggled.
“Oh yes. I think so too. Erin. I think Palt likes you. As in, romantically.”
Erin froze.
“Nuh uh.”
“Yep. Mrsha agrees, right?”
The young Gnoll smiled happily. Then she had a thought. Maybe she could tell Ryoka about Lyonette’s objectionable tryst with Pawn. She tugged on Ryoka’s arm and tried to figure out how to convey that.
Erin was shaken.
“Nah. But he’s—you know, a Centaur. Not that that’s a bad thing. But I’m just me. Palt’s just nice…”
“So he’s stuck around the inn, helps you, cooks in your kitchen because he’s ‘just nice’. Erin. You’re being cruel.”
The [Innkeeper] recoiled.
“I’m not—”
Ryoka gave her a level look.
“Be honest. You know I’m right.”
“I don’t know—”
Erin broke off. She had come to the same conclusion. But she hadn’t been sure. Ryoka looked at her.
“You could ignore it. But that’s something I’d have done. You owe it to Palt to say something.”
“But…”
The City Runner took pity on Erin. She shrugged, self-consciously.
“It’s not my business. But think about it, Erin. Just remember, pretending not to notice isn’t fair to him. Now—tell me about Pelt. Why do their names sound so similar?”
“Oh—he’s a Dwarf.”
“I got that bit. But why…everything?”
Ryoka frowned. Erin shrugged.
“I dunno. I just met him. He’s really good with metal and stuff. He made my knife.”
She unsheathed it and waved it around, cutting a bit of grass. Ryoka and Mrsha both leaned back. The City Runner grunted.
“Huh. If I had anything…well, I could use more caltrops. I threw nearly all of them at the Bloodfeast Raiders. I wish I had something I really needed to buy. But I need a…[Seamstress] rather than a [Blacksmith]. For now. I have ideas.”
“Like what?”
Suddenly very interested, Mrsha and Erin sat forwards. The City Runner hesitated.
But this was a moment where they were able to talk. In private, in earnest—only a few things were off the table. Erin’s love life one of them, apparently. Teriarch and Belavierr another. But anything short of that? Ryoka casually twirled a finger.
A breeze blew through the Garden of Sanctuary. It ruffled Erin’s hair and Mrsha laughed in silent delight. Ryoka smiled. Even here, the wind blew. Softly, though; Ryoka doubted she could convince the wind to rage here. There were rules. Even if she didn’t know all of them. That was why she wanted to meet Ivolethe again…
Among other things. Ryoka sighed.
