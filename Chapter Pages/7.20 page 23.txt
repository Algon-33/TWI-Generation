“Oh wow. I can’t believe we’re here.”
“Try not to gape, Ceria. Myself, I think it looks rather plain.”
“Plain? Shut your mouth, Pisces! I’ve dreamed of being in here! So has Yvlon!”
Ceria looked around the bar. It may have been just another room, albeit far more plush than the main room of the Adventurer’s guild, but there was the board with requests meant for Gold-ranks and higher. Worn, from all the many teams who must have touched it!
And the room had teams in it! They turned to see the two new adventurers. Ceria stared around as Pisces, cool as a cucumber in the shade, looked about. She knew she was gaping.
“Well, well. Fresh meat! Are you two lost or do you belong here?”
A swarthy man with a bandage on one shoulder stood up. He strode over with a swagger; Ceria saw him pass by a table of three half-Elves and three Humans, who looked up and dismissed him. The man walked over to Ceria.
“Name’s Todi. Captain Todi. And you’re what, greenhorns? Silver-ranks?”
“Gold-ranks, actually. We just arrived to Invrisil. I’m Ceria, Captain of the Horns of Hammerad.”
Ceria smiled. Todi glanced at Pisces. The [Necromancer] nodded.
“Pisces.”
Todi’s eyes flickered. He frowned.
“Name’s…familiar. Do I know you?”
“Not at all.”
“Well, you two are clearly new in Invrisil. Greenhorn’s stare. Know it anywhere. You have more teammates?”
The man’s presumptuous questioning made Ceria blink, but she was still riding a high from being here.
“That’s right. Two of our teammates are out, but—”
“Excellent. In that case, why don’t you get them and come back. Introduce yourselves properly and we’ll all have a drink.”
Todi smiled. He patted Ceria’s shoulder and gestured towards the door. Ceria stared at him.
“What?”
“It’s customary. New teams come in together. Buy everyone a round. Then, we talk. It’s respectful. Don’t worry, I’m just saving you some embarrassment. Not everyone would tell you. Off you go.”
He motioned them towards the door. Ceria blinked. She nearly turned, but Pisces just sighed.
“This reminds me of Wistram. Thank you. Todi, was it? You may buy us drinks if you wish. But we’re not staying around long. Let’s check out the requests, Ceria.”
He glanced past the man and walked past Todi. The Gold-rank adventurer’s face darkened.
“Hey. Rude fellow, aren’t you? Sure I don’t know you? You’re making a mistake.”
“And you’re being quite rude yourself. How do we know you are not new yourself, sir?”
Pisces looked back. There was a chuckle from around the inn. Some of the other Gold-rank teams were watching the spectacle. Todi blinked at Pisces. Ceria sighed.
“Excuse me. That’s my teammate. Pisces, be polite. Thank you—Captain Todi? But my other teammates are out.”
She walked past Todi as well. The man looked at the two Horns and shook his head.
“Brats. So that’s the new generation, huh? Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
He walked back, chuckling to himself. Ceria felt a dozen pairs of eyes on her back. She hesitated—but Pisces was studying the requests board.
“Hm. Interesting.”
He appeared unaffected by the stares. But that was just because he was an excellent actor. Ceria looked at the requests. Or pretended to.
“Maybe we should leave.”
“And bow to a petty little tyrant? We can play their game, or not, Ceria. This is hazing, like the 3rd Year’s swim around the island. Remember?”
Ceria nodded glumly. Wistram had their own groups like this. But—she hesitated.
