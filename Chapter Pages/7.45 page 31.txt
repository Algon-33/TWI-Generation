The man gestured towards the keep.
“He—he’s fallen asleep. He was running to [Alchemists], looking for a cure. Don’t blame him. But Salamani did remember—when you were first brought to the cells, before you woke up, your friend was distraught. She said she attacked you.”
The room of insanity. Ryoka’s head slowly rose. Yes…she recalled that. And—and something else.
Fierre had drank her blood. Not just that. Ryoka shot upright.
“The fucking rats.”
“The rats?”
Ylawes blinked. Ryoka whirled.
“I know what it could be! I forgot!”
The green rats Fierre had been snacking on! They had to be—plague rats? Radioactive? Ryoka’s mind was racing a mile a minute. She hesitated, torn—then she raced for the kitchen.
“Colfa! I know what made Fierre sick!”
The woman spun. She was making food for her guests, being the only former Human among her family who had possessed a strong interest in cooking.
“What? Tell me!”
“Rats. Fierre was in the isle. And she ate rats…they might have been poisoned! I bet Valeterisa has damn poison rats or something! Or—it could be me. Fierre. She drank my blood.”
Ryoka babbled an explanation. Colfa’s eyes widened. She glanced over Ryoka’s shoulder; Ylawes was hurrying after them.
“What’s wrong with your blood?”
“I’m—”
I’m from another world. Ryoka knew it had to be one or the other. That was the only thing Fierre had imbibed that was out of the ordinary that no one else had!
“We need to figure out which it was. If it was one or the other…”
“We don’t have these rats. Was there something off about them?”
“They were green.”
“Green? And Fierre ate them?”
Colfa was horrified. Ryoka cursed. If only they had…
“Wait. Waitaminute. Ylawes—”
She caught the [Knight] as he peeked in. Ryoka looked around.
“I—think I know what’s wrong with Fierre.”
“What?”
“Rats. She uh—ate some green rats.”
“What, ate them?”
The [Knight] was horrified. Ryoka nodded rapidly. It was close to the truth! She looked around and turned to Colfa. The mother was eying Ryoka’s neck. She covered her mouth with her hand as she turned to the [Knight].
“Perhaps you can ask about rat-related diseases, Adventurer Ylawes?”
“I’m sure there are hundreds. Let me wake Falene.”
The appalled young man backed away. Ryoka’s mind was spinning.
“I think—I think—Fierre might have saved some rats as a snack. In her bag of holding!”
“That sounds like her. Her bag of holding…follow me.”
Colfa blurred. Ylawes raised his head and stared as she zipped out of the kitchen and down the halls of her keep. She was moving too fast. But neither she nor Ryoka was in the right state of mind.
Fierre’s bag of holding was lying in the bathroom—she’d forgotten to take it with her. Colfa and Ryoka found it after about eight minutes of running around and cursing.
“Let’s see. Artifacts, scrolls, potions—fuck.”
Ryoka grabbed a handful of sludge. Colfa recoiled and held her nose.
“What is that?”
“Fierre threw up into the bag of holding. It’s everywhere. Ugh, ugh…here!”
Ryoka pulled out a green rat, freshly dead and smelling only a bit from the bag of holding. Colfa recoiled.
“She ate that?”
“She said they were tasty. Here—”
Ryoka tried to shove the rat into Colfa’s mouth. The woman slapped Ryoka’s hand down.
“I’ll see what blood it has. But it could be yours, you said? Why did Fierre drain your blood?”
“It was an accident. Here—”
Ryoka fumbled with a knife. She slashed across her wrist. Colfa froze in the act of washing the rat.
Blood ran down Ryoka’s arm. She thrust it at the Vampires.
“Here.”
“Are you mad?”
“I’ll drink a healing potion! Just—”
