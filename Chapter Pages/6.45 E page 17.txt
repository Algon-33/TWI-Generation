It was raining again. Ullim saw his [Lord]’s eyes flashing as Tyrion strode across the room.
“Magic.”
“Someone must have reversed the [Weatherchange] spell, Lord Veltras.”
“Who?”
There was no answer Ullim could give. He could only speculate.
“It may be the work of another spell in another province. Weather magic does have wide-ranging effects. If the rain is being diverted—”
“Ullim. I don’t want speculation. I want answers. Who is causing this? Give me a list of people who could have caused it.”
Tyrion coldly dismissed his [Majordomo]. Which left Ullim scrambling to ask questions where he didn’t know where to start. However, he was able to come back two hours later with a bunch of [Messages].
“Lord Veltras, we may know who caused the rain.”
“Go on.”
Tyrion and his aide looked up. The [Lord] frowned as his personal [Mage], Jericha, looked up from her own spellbooks. Ullim cleared his throat.
“A [Witch] passed through your lands some time ago, Lord Veltras. Around the same time the rains began. The villages distinctly recalled her passing—she was known as Eloise, or the ah, ‘Tea Witch’. She seems to be highly regarded by some. But hers was a notable passing. No one can recall if she was given offense, but many believe she may have cursed the region for some slight.”
“A [Witch]? I asked for answers, Ullim. Not superstition.”
Tyrion frowned darkly. Ullim coughed.
“I understand, Lord Veltras. But there are no other notable events I could find. And [Witches] can change the weather…”
“Not for this long. At least, not without considerable magic. Lord Veltras, I wouldn’t lay too much faith in this being a [Witch]’s doing. There is magic in the weather we’re experiencing. But I can’t lift it and I doubt a [Witch] would be inclined to use this much magic for a slight.”
Jericha frowned. Ullim raised a finger.
“Ah. However, I discovered one more thing of note. A discrete inquiry revealed that this [Witch] is in fact a former [Lady].”
“What?”
Both Tyrion and Jericha started. Ullim nodded. It had been worth paying for that tidbit.
“Lady Eloise of House Havin. She hails from Terandria. She left her house and was considered dead to her family over three decades ago. But she is apparently the very same [Lady].”
“A [Lady] becoming a [Witch]? And she’s known as the Tea Witch?”
Jericha looked appalled at the thought. But Lord Tyrion’s brows just snapped together. He came to the same conclusion that had crossed Ullim’s mind in a moment.
“Reinhart.”
Ullim nodded, darkly satisfied. It was just a hypothesis, but one [Lady] was known to have ties to countless nobles. And Magnolia Reinhart loved tea, albeit with enough sugar to classify it as something else entirely. She was also, Ullim knew, greatly fond of using agents to achieve her ends.
“Lord Veltras. After some investigation, I have noted that Lord Erill, Lady Ieka, Lord Pellmia, and a number of other notable peers of the realm are all suffering from some kind of disturbance in their weather. And Invrisil is not. Furthermore—Lord Pellmia’s [Manservant], Kilmet, reported the presence of another [Witch] passing through his lands. A figure of note. A Hedag. Or Hedag the [Executioner]. I’m not clear on whether it was a name of title.”
Ullim was rewarded by his lord’s furious expression. Tyrion Veltras strode over to a map, plotting Lord Pellmia’s lands.
“[Witches]. And Reinhart’s lands are unaffected?”
“She may have hired these [Witches] in conjunction with the trade war, sire. I can investigate. If a [Witch] did perform a ritual, they would have had to anchor the spell. We might discover it.”
