Yvlon bit her tongue. Desais glanced at her, frowning slightly. She went back to her interrogation. The other criminals were standing, unable to sit, having to endure this delay.
“The truth in question seems to be your truth spell account of what occurred versus Magistrate Ducaz’s. Both register as true statements. I wonder…”
“He could have lied.”
One of the [Guards] slapped the back of Yvlon’s head. Hard. The woman staggered.
“How dare you accuse a [Magistrate] of Nerrhavia’s Fallen of corruption!”
The words were bellowed into her ear. Yvlon felt her temper rise. She—controlled herself. Barely.
Desais glared at the [Guard] until they stepped back. The woman sighed.
“The truth will be found. I have lodged a formal inquiry with an [Arbiter of Law], who will look into this.”
“But what about my team? My…?”
The [Chancellor] silenced Yvlon again. She looked harried, annoyed—and worried.
“Your team will be found, Adventurer Byres. However, in the interim—we have established your slaughter of innocent civilians and guards is in doubt. What is not is that you did, by your admission, attack a [Magistrate] of Nerrhavia’s Fallen and injure dozens of [Guards]!”
“Because he—”
Yvlon raised her voice. Desais glowered at her.
“You have broken the law. And that…yes, that is the fact. Which makes my task simple. I will inform my superiors you have been found, and notify the Adventurer’s Guild of your location and the crimes. Which is my task. An [Arbiter] will investigate the truth of your guilt.”
She was speaking to herself, and Yvlon did not like the way Desais’ tone sounded more reassured as she went over her course of action.
“You can’t just ignore what I said! The [Magistrate]—”
Desais winced and licked her lips. Yvlon realized some of the [Guards] were looking worried.
“A [Magistrate] is a very high-ranking official. I, personally, am only taking down your account. An [Arbiter] is better positioned to investigate…claims.”
She was afraid. Yvlon ground her teeth together. Afraid of Ducaz? Or maybe however he had managed to break the law and lie. She was going to pass on the responsibility! Which meant ignoring Yvlon!
“You can’t do that. I am a Gold-rank adventurer. I—am a [Lady] of the House of Byres. I demand to speak to…Prince Zenol of Nerrhavia’s Fallen! I w—”
She went silent a third time as Desais slashed her hand and Yvlon’s mouth closed. Yvlon’s third mistake was threatening the [Weaver-Chancellor] with the immediate consequences of not helping her. Desais looked at Yvlon and came to a speedy decision.
“Submit the request. As for this prisoner—we do not treat foreign nobility any different than criminals of our own. Place her there—”
Yvlon shouted through her gag, but it was too late. The [Guards] herded her over and her brief thought to burst her bindings again was put to rest. Where would she go? The city was full of [Guards] and Yvlon had no bearings, no gear.
She glowered like a storm cloud as the [Chancellor] spoke, inspecting the criminals as a whole. The Stitchwoman ignored her, rapidly pointing and speaking. Yvlon had no idea what was happening, until she realized this was what should have happened had she not been identified.
“Mines. Those men. That woman—and that one. Wait. Are they [Bandits]? Then…only those two. Have those six…assigned to river work. They need more. Are there any extant bids via Roshal?”
One of the [Scribes] consulted a list.
“For a [Bandit Lord] or [Bandit Lady], yes.”
“And the price? I see. Then—the [Bandit Lady], Merr the Storm, is to go to Roshal if they agree. Next!”
