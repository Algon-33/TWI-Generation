She was only a hundred and fifty-six years old, but she had lived that time as a mortal, born and raised in Ailendamus. Each year counted, not wasted. She had served as a warrior, [Mage], and [General] for nearly a century, but had not been called on regularly.
Chronologically? She guessed she was over sixteen hundred years old. The Great General of Ages sighed as she looked down the famous pass that had won so many wars. Was this her end? She smiled and waited to see how the Dawn Concordat would hold it. Then she raised her head to the sky.
“To Duke Rhisveri. We have reached the mouth of Krawlnmak’s Pass. Time dilation has ended. Our advance in real-time has begun. I await the final army of Calanfer. Please let me know if the Five Families are coming.”
They would be a problem, but the Wyrm of Ailendamus had taught her well. The Great General looked ahead, then behind, and then to the sky. A great battle and, hopefully, victory approached.
But then, what was it she sensed? Something else on the wind?
In time, they would find out.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: Gah. That’s a lotta words.
We have begun the delayed but hopefully awaited Rabbiteater-Tyrion-Ryoka-Cara-Rhisveri-Eldavin-Greg arc. And yes, all are equally important. I hope you enjoy and look forwards to the next chapter.
I’ve got work to do. Real stuff work, which I hate. But the trick is doing the stuff I have to do fast as possible and getting back to writing.
Put me in a box like one of Sophridel’s mask-people. Anyways. I’ll end it here since I’m out of words to actually summarize how I feel. Wordy, after my break. I’ll run out of energy soon enough but hope you liked it. Let me know and thanks for reading!
 
I have gotten a lot of birthday art! I rarely link ‘pirateaba’ art since my avatar is Pirate which isn’t me, but this is an exeption! Plus, everyone got Pirate the character right.
