It was a nonsense song. The first one was. The rest as well. Each one was silly, made up. A child’s song where Bird repeated his own name. There was no melody, no accompaniment. But it was a song.
While Pawn and the other Workers paced anxiously and Klbkch waited, afraid of what he might have to explain to Erin, the Queen of the Free Antinium sat in her chambers and listened to Bird sing. He perched on her feeler, sat, and sang about birds and water and what he saw every day. And she listened. Entranced.
Workers did not sing. They had not been designed to. They had not been given the tools, mental or physical that would allow them to make music of any kind. Yet Bird sang. Somewhere in his flawed mind, he had discovered music. And that was a wonder.
“You are special, little Worker.”
“I am special.”
Bird looked up at the Queen. He was so confident. She envied him that. In his way he had obtained something she could not. She thought of her experiments. The pain and death there bothered her. The failure. For each step she took forwards, she took a thousand back. What she made—the pinnacle of her creation in Klbkch was copying, redefining what was already there.
But in the past the Antinium had created beauty. They had created, and what they had created was unique. Klbkch’s first form had been grace and death and elegance at once. Xrn was a reminder of that. And she had fallen once before as well. They all had.
She was so lonely. The Free Queen sat with Bird on her lap. She touched his head gently as he stopped singing.
“I find you worthy, Bird.”
“That is good. Pawn and Revalantor Klbkch will be happy to hear that.”
“Yes they will. I am pleased with you. And because I am pleased, I will allow you to reside in these chambers. You will sing for me each day.”
Bird looked up. The Queen opened her mandibles and raised them in a smile. The Worker tilted his head, and then he spoke.
“No.”
“What?”
The Queen stared at him. Bird stood up.
“I do not want to stay here. You are nice, my Queen. But I will go back up to Miss Erin’s inn, please. I want to hunt birds.”
“Birds?”
“Yes. There are no birds underground. And I want to hunt them. So I will go back above. And bring Miss Erin her rucksack.”
The Queen stared at Bird. She closed her feelers. He made a small sound, like a squeak.
“I do not wish to let you leave. I would keep you here.”
“But I do not want to be here.”
Bird stared up at the Queen. She stared back.
“I am your Queen.”
“Yes.”
“You should obey me.”
“Do I have to?”
Frustrated, the Queen lowered Bird.
“That is your purpose! You must stay to sing for me. I demand it!”
“But there is nothing to sing about here. And I must go back above. Erin will miss me. She does not mind if I have flaws. She likes me.”
Bird’s plaintive voice struck a chord in the Queen. She lowered her head.
“I like you, Bird. And I will make you whole. Stay here and sing. And I will fix your mind.”
“But I do not want you to.”
This time the Queen paused. She stared down at the Worker as he stood before her.
“What do you mean? You are flawed. Your mind does not work properly. You should be fixed.”
“Should I?”
He tilted his head. Bird patted his chest and waved all four arms about.
“I am Bird. You say I am broken. This is probably so. Pawn tells me I do wrong things. So does Erin and Revalantor Klbkch and everyone else. My mind is faulty. This is so. But if you fixed me, what would I be? Not Bird. Not me. So I will be me, and be faulty. Please?”
