Four arrows struck the Wyvern’s head. Two along the neck. One glanced off a tooth. The last—missed the eye. Kel closed his eyes. Then he opened them.
“Brace—”
The Wyvern pointed its head at Kel. It inhaled—and Kel heard a voice.
“Guardsman, left! [Rapid Retreat]!”
Kel jerked at the voice of command. He felt his legs move. The Watch surged left, moving fast—faster than Kel could have imagined. The Wyvern exhaled.
Frost stung Kel’s back. Froze his scales against his armor. He cried out, but the Wyvern had missed. It stared at the empty street, then the squad that had dodged as one. The Wyvern recoiled. Kel looked around.
“Fall back! Archers, covering fire! Aim for the wings! Keep it from flying!”
The Watch reacted instinctively. They fell back, showering the Wyvern with arrows. It hissed as the arrows struck its wings. Kel looked around. Where—?
There. A Drake with light blue scales was shouting from a rooftop. He pointed.
“Now! Relc!”
“On it!”
A huge Drake charged past Kel. He had a long spear in one hand. Kel shouted. The Drake was alone! But he was so quick! A blur shot towards the Wyvern. Relc charged into the monster’s huge chest.
“[Triple Thrust]!”
His spear struck three times in an instant. The Wyvern recoiled, staring down at the three holes punched in its hide. It tried to back up, fanning its wings.
“[Attack Formation]! Hit the wings!”
The [Strategist] shouted. Kel saw the [Archers] aiming, placing their shots. The Wyvern’s wings filled with holes. It tried to fly—Relc braced, and stabbed with all of his might. His spear went deep into the Wyvern’s side. It shrieked and tried to get away. The [Guardsman] pushed in. The spear slowly pierced the Wyvern and it writhed, trying to get away.
“Forwards! Watch the legs! Use the pikes and strike it from afar!”
The squad surged forwards again. They joined the unknown Drake and stabbed mercilessly. The Wyvern tried to fly one last time, but like the first it died.
Relc’s spear was embedded halfway through its guts. The Drake pulled the spear out, grunting with effort. He looked around.
“Hey.”
“Who are you? Guardsman?”
Kel recognized the uniform, but not the Drake’s colors. Then a light went in his head. He stared at Liscor’s insignia. Then the stripes on one armband.
“Senior Guardsman?”
Relc grinned.
“That’s me. Hey Olesm! Get down here! The Wyverns will pick you off!”
“I’m surveying the situation! Relc—there’s trouble two streets that way! Another Wyvern!”
The Drake cursed.
“Damn. Alright! Here I go!”
He turned. Kel didn’t even see the Drake start running. Relc was blurring down the street as the Drake on the rooftop took another look around and then ran.
“Squad—injured?”
“They got Shais.”
“No. I’m alive.”
Shais panted. Kel looked around as the squad sounded off. Then he heard a voice.
“Who’s in charge here?”
Kel looked around. The Drake called Olesm was standing in the street. He looked and sounded like an officer, but again, not one Kel had ever met. The Desk Sergeant instinctively saluted.
“Desk Sergeant Kel! 8th Floor’s Watch House! Who—who are you?”
“Olesm. Strategist for Liscor.”
“Liscor?”
The [Guards] stared. But yes—of course! Kel’s eyes widened.
“The door?”
Olesm nodded. He was staring at the sky, adjusting a glowing ring on one clawed finger.
“Liscor’s sending all of its Gold-rank adventurers. I came through as well as Relc.”
“He’s going to fight a Wyvern? We have to reinforce—”
Patrol Leader Medain turned. Olesm barked.
