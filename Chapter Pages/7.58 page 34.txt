She had an enchanted bike and her wind—if it came back to her. It had to be done, though. Someone had to try.
Ryoka pedaled forwards. She felt her mortality now, now that she had seen people dying. But she would—just let her feel the wind. Let her fly—
“I warned you. I should have warned Erin. But even I didn’t think she was capable of this. Not yet.”
Someone spoke up. Ryoka slowed—then accelerated.
Maviola El kicked the bike as it passed her. Ryoka crashed again. The [Lady Firestarter] saw Ryoka struggling upwards, swearing.
She had been waiting here, for Ryoka. Tracking her—it was hardly difficult. The [Lady] saw Ryoka grab for the bike.
“I have it! Don’t try to stop me—”
Ryoka righted the bike. Maviola slapped her. Ryoka’s head jerked. She spun, fist clenched as Maviola grabbed the handlebars. The [Lady] looked at Ryoka, shaking her head. Her look was part admiration, part envy, part incredulity. And a sprinkling of anger.
“You simple idiot. You gigantic fool. You courageous child.”
She spoke to Ryoka. The Wind Runner tried to drag the bike away, but the old [Lady] held firm. This was not the time for a long chat.
“Don’t stop me, Maviola! I know I might die. I have to try. They fought for me. Erin fought for me. I have the cure—”
Ryoka brandished the clear vial at Maviola. The [Lady] sighed.
“Ryoka Griffin. That’s not the cure. That’s a vial of water.”
The Wind Runner froze. Maviola stared at the vial.
“Did you even check to see if there was magic in it?”
“That can’t be right. Saliss—”
Had been going to leave the vial behind. Ryoka’s head slowly rose. Maviola sighed.
“Who would have gone into the Runner’s Guild if Erin had not set fire to half the city? He said two hours. Then he would have let them smash the vial. He did not expect you to be so brave or foolhardy. See?”
She pointed. Ryoka’s head turned. She saw someone blurring down the street. Moving as fast as only a Potion of [Haste] could take him.
Saliss of Lights halted. It wasn’t surprising they all reached the same gate. It was the closest one from the Runner’s Guild heading north and west.
“Oh, hey. Listen, Ryoka. About the cure. Couldn’t say it in the Guild, but—”
Ryoka pointed at him.
“You. You have the cure.”
Saliss blinked. He eyed Maviola and Ryoka and gave them a sly grin.
“Ah. Well…I didn’t expect anyone to try and get it. Old Xif made a mess of everything. As usual. Was going to hire you to be my decoy, anyways. What about it?”
“You’re going to deliver the cure? Give it to me. You’re not a Runner.”
The Drake rolled his eyes.
“I’m a Named Adventurer. I could outrun you, Miss Griffin. Look, I don’t have time for this.”
He tried to jog around Ryoka. She grabbed for him and Saliss swayed back.
“You tricked me!”
The [Alchemist] gave her a side-eye.
“I am Saliss of Lights. Did you think I’d trust this kind of thing to a half-baked City Runner?”
“Why?”
Ryoka was shaking. What was all her resolve for? Saliss threw up his claws.
“Maybe I’m tired of being told who my enemies are. Maybe I don’t like [Assassins]. Maybe I’m just bored and want to go for a jog.”
“The entire north is going to stop you. Not just the Circle. You’re a Drake. From Pallass. The enemy!”
The Drake snorted. He looked ahead.
“They could try. I’m Saliss of Lights. My ego is better at fighting than the two of you put together.”
“I have to do it. I can’t just turn back now. Give me—”
The two fought as Ryoka tried to grab for Saliss’ belt pouch. He backed up. Maviola stepped between them.
