“Ah, the Silver Arm herself. Good, good. These two are part of your team, yes?”
Rexel and Leprel were standing in front of the guards; the [Gambler] was hiding in her cell. Yvlon froze. Her hand clenched and the others tensed.
“What are you doing with them?”
The [Arena Master]’s smile was sweaty. He edged behind the largest [Gladiator] and called out.
“Calm, Silver Arm! Calm. It is not time for an arena match yet. You may not even be fighting in my Arena, thank Nerrhavia’s grave. Just…come with us.”
Yvlon Byres’ eyes narrowed dangerously. She was on the edge of everything snapping. Death might come for her since the [Guards] and [Gladiators] were all armed and her entire body wasn’t made of silversteel, but…she gritted her teeth so hard they nearly cracked.
“What are you doing with us, then?”
She tensed—

—And poked the duvet bedspread again. Yvlon Byres stared at the window with glass, no bars, and then at Rexel and Leprel.
“What?”
“That’s your room, Silver Killer! Yvlon! This one’s mine—look at all the food!”
The [Storm Bandit] turned [Gladiator] danced about, laughing. Yvlon stared at the table full of delicacies, then at the only indication this was even a cell; the enchanted door at the far end.
“But why?”
“A patron! Someone saw the battle! We have a patron!”
Leprel explained again. The [Thief] was dripping with water; she’d bathed for the first time since being caught. With scented soaps and shampoos!
Patron. A [Gladiator]’s patron. Someone had seen Yvlon fight, reached out to the [Arena Master] and…suddenly their fortunes had changed. Yvlon stared around the comfy suite, for the highest-class [Gladiators] in the Arena of Rust.
Leprel and Rexel had been afforded the same suite, as they were on Yvlon’s ‘team’. They’d been ready to deny all connections with her, but it seemed their faith had been rewarded. The [Thief] and [Storm Bandit] were high-fiving, investigating their quarters…Rexel gasped.
“They even have spare parts! Look!”
She had found some pieces of cloth. Arms, legs—a [Gladiator]’s replacement bodyparts. Some were higher-quality than her own cloth, so she began trying to undo the strings on her arm.
“Leprel, help me put this arm on! It looks way better than mine!”
“I hope this is to your satisfaction, Miss Byres?”
A voice from the door made all three turn. Rexel and Leprel stopped and Yvlon looked at the [Arena Master]. He was still wary of her, but he smiled with all the insincerity in his body.
“Thank you for the accommodations.”
Yvlon meant not a word herself, but the Stitch-man just grinned at her.
“A [Patron] was very generous. I would advise you to rest up and take full advantage of the facilities of the Arena of Rust, Miss Byres. It will not last long.”
The [Armsmistress] felt a warning tinge in her stomach—or maybe it was just another sign she needed relief.
“Why not?”
“Because you will not be fighting in my arena. Oh, no. You have been elevated. The capital’s arena waits for you after what you did to the Champion of Rust.”
Leprel and Rexel’s faces were awestruck and terrified. Yvlon just grunted.
“Wonderful. More comfort for more danger?”
The [Arena Master] shook his head. He was an older man, in his sixties. He gave Yvlon an insulted look past faded eyes and his own scars.
