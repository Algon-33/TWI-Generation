There was no time to think. The Bloodfields surrounded them as the ice-chariot raced forwards. Yvlon felt the danger immediately. She bellowed.
“Ceria! The roots!”
The same trap roots that had gotten Tommie lay in their path. Ceria saw them and screamed.
“Left! Left!”
The Horns flung themselves to the side. The chariot turned, the undead horses carrying them onto the left set of wheels, missing the trapped root. Pisces turned the horses, swearing.
“What do we do?”
“Take us to the Watchertree! We need to get to them!”
Ceria pointed. But the red plains were coming alive. Yvlon saw movement to the left. And the huge insect beds.
“Steer clear of them! Pisces! Those are trapped!”
“On it!”
The [Necromancer] urged the horses onwards and Yvlon braced as the chariot bounced across the uneven ground. She stared ahead. The two men were prone.
“It’s—bleeding them. But they’re alive!”
“Tommie’s got a potion. So does the other one. But the tree keeps stabbing them!”
Ceria called out. The chariot slowed, at the edge of the barren dead zone. Pisces hesitated.
“If we run in there we’ll be hit!”
“Captain Ceria! Movement to our rear! Monsters!”
“What the—”
Ceria turned. Her eyes widened. Yvlon was staring at Tommie. The two men had seen the Horns.
“Get back! Get back! We’re trapped! The root’s as strong as steel!”
Tommie was screaming at them. He was hacking at the root in his leg and shoulder, sobbing with pain. Belt wasn’t moving. Pisces pointed at the Watchertree.
“That is the heart of the plant. Let me try to strike it! [Shatterbolt].”
He flicked his wrist, and the magical dart shot towards the tree. But Pisces missed. Only by a few inches, but it turned into a large gap as the magical bolt flashed past the tree. The [Necromancer] cursed. Then he pointed his finger.
“[Deathbolt].”
Yvlon jerked as a magical bolt of energy flashed from Pisces’ finger. This time it struck the tree, but nothing happened. She looked at him.
“Did it—”
“I don’t know! It’s too strong! Ceria!”
The two adventurers turned. Ceria was staring at something behind them. She jerked as Pisces grabbed her.
“Ceria! Hit the tree!”
“Right!”
The [Cryomancer] turned. She rose, aimed her wand.
“[Ice Spike]!”
The first shard of ice was dead-on. It hit the Watchertree along the bulbous top. But the ice broke harmlessly, not even leaving a mark. Ceria stared.
“Cast something stronger! [Fireball]!”
Pisces was shouting at her. Ceria nodded and raised her wand. This time the [Fireball] exploded on the Watchertree’s base. The flames flared, and Ceria heard the roar. She peeked up and—
“Oh dead gods.”
The Watchertree was unscathed! No—it was smoldering. A bit had been torn out, but—Ceria raised her wand to cast again.
“Ceria! We’ve got company!”
She whirled. The half-Elf’s eyes went round.
“Oh, tree rot. What is that?”
Dozens of huge, red…blobs were rolling towards them. Dark red, covered in what looked like crude armor! Ksmvr loosed an arrow and watched it sink into the exterior.
“Blood Slimes. Captain Ceria, this is a Silver-rank threat!”
“They’re big! And they’ve got—armor!”
Ceria aimed an [Ice Spike] at one. She watched it shatter on the armor.
“[Ice Wall]! Pisces, fire!”
“On it!”
He shot flames at one of the Blood Slimes. With the other, he pointed.
“[Deathbolt].”
The magical energy hit a slime, slowing it’s roll towards their chariot. Ceria stared.
“What the—”
“Tommie! Forget the slimes! Get Tommie!”
“My spells aren’t strong enough! The slimes—”
Yvlon looked towards the slimes and then Ceria. Pisces was conjuring a Bone Horror. He gritted his teeth.
