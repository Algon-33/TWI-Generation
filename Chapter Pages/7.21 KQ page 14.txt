That was all he cared about. Trey met Fetohep’s gaze. The [King] shook his head with true regret.
“A ruler cannot always be moral, Trey Atwood. Nor do I know if A’ctelios can be destroyed with all of Khelt’s power. Buried, perhaps. But the Tombhome was slain by the original inhabitants of A’ctelios. And they were heroes. They felled a nightmare. That excuses none of this generation’s offense. But it is a reason…”
He trailed off. Trey looked at him and turned away.
“Trey Atwood. I would do much in my power for you. But I am still a [King].“
The voice was quiet. Trey shuddered.
“I know, your Majesty. Thank you. But—”
He brushed at his eyes. And felt as if he’d wept all his tears. Slowly, Trey Atwood rose. And he looked around. At Fetohep, resting in his seat, unchanging. At Khelt, this perfect place.
“I have to go. Don’t I?”
Fetohep of Khelt paused. And his undead gaze flickered.
“No. Not if you do not wish to. I have told you: Khelt welcomes you, Trey Atwood. Stay as you wish. My subjects will offer you every comfort. My treasuries will satisfy your wildest imaginations. Ask what you will. And it will be granted to you.”
Like…a friend. A grandfather. A kindly ruler, offering Trey anything he wanted. And the young man was so tempted.
A night with the most beautiful woman. Food and drink unlimited. Magical treasures. Safety, comfort, riches.
It was all here. Here, waiting for him. Fetohep would give it to Trey and not even Flos would be able to take Trey away.
That was the truth. But the young man turned. He looked Fetohep in his undead face. And he did not flinch. That was part of why Fetohep loved him. Trey inhaled, once.
“Your Majesty. Do any of the King of Destruction’s vassals seek me?”
The undead [King] hesitated. But then he nodded.
“Lord Venith Crusland has brought five thousand of Reim’s [Soldiers]. He is attempting to cross the border. None of his party have sustained more than superficial injuries. Yet.”
Loyalty. Trey closed his eyes. Venith would try Khelt, even if it meant fighting all of the undead.
“I have to go, your Majesty. I have…a mission. I can’t speak of it, truly. His Majesty has orders for me.”
“Must you go? You owe that boy nothing.”
The ruler of Khelt almost reached for Trey. And the young man stepped away. He smiled at Fetohep. And he bowed, deeply. Gratefully. But he still left. Trey walked towards the door, and as Fetohep rose, he spoke.
“Your Majesty. You are too kind to me. You have given me every comfort in this world, and I am eternally grateful. And you are wise. Wiser than I. But—that is why I must go. Because I am mortal. And flawed. And I see A’ctelios’ horrors. And I cannot forgive.”
He pointed. Fetohep looked at the camera, sitting on the little table. Trey had left it behind, with the backpack.
“You see why A’ctelios is needed. The lives of a few can be sacrificed for the good of all. And that is—a [King]’s wisdom. But I serve the King of Destruction. And he would go to war for a single child. He will give me vengeance if I ask. Thank you. And—goodbye. I fear it might be some time before we meet again. If we do.”
“Trey—”
Trey bowed again. He turned and left. And then he was gone. Riding south. To his fate. To serve the King of Destruction.
Fetohep felt him go. He sat still, unmoving, until Trey had left his lands. And that took hours. Only then did the [King] rise. And he walked listlessly out of his room.
His treasures awaited him. His people. But the [King] was suddenly alone. And he stood awhile, on a balcony overlooking his magnificent city.
Pondering what he had lost.
