“I believe that I might be a suitable opponent. For a demonstration match. Pray, don’t feel too upset if I take the quest right now.”
He looked around as the inn’s crowd susurrated. Niers eyed Pisces as he sat down. The [Mage] had no Skills to help him out, but Niers vaguely remembered him being a sharp player, and he had trained against Erin Solstice.
Perhaps the [Necromancer] just wanted to be part of the moment. However—he’d made a critical mistake. In fact, Erin had, in a sense.
Because she had posted a <Quest>. Because she knew she could. A <Heroic Quest>. And as Pisces sat down, Erin’s smile to him changed. Her hazel eyes suddenly began burning, the brown-green-gold shimmering and dancing as if her very irises had caught on fire.
The [Necromancer] blinked. That wasn’t a trick of the light. Then—as if he had forgotten, as if he had taken the words for granted, he saw a line on the <Quest> paper light up.
 
I’ll come at you with my best.
 
Then—the table began shaking. Pisces was thrown about in his chair, and the [Necromancer] shouted.
“What—what’s happen—”
The table dropped, and suddenly, he was free-falling through space. The flailing young man fell—and the inn and the guests vanished. He landed without pain on the ground, crouching, reaching for his rapier instinctively. Then he looked up.
A lunar landscape of blasted pale, sooty ground and glowing lines drawn into perfect squares stretched out ahead of him. Pisces saw graven towers rising out of the dirt—and he was simultaneously staring up at an equine [Knight] rearing above him, snarling as the hooves pawed at the air.
A Golem? The tower was sixteen feet tall. And at the same time—it was a knight piece, small enough to pick up. He was in the void of blackness. Then—he saw something rising in the distance.
Her head appeared over the horizon like a Giant of old. Her eyes were on fire, and she had a hat burning on her head. The [Necromancer] looked around and tried to pinch himself out of the illusion. But Erin Solstice stared down at him as the entire world began to shake. He saw light writing itself over her head.
Then—the [Necromancer] felt a pit drop out of his stomach. Because he was reading something. Her very best? He looked up and saw a class.
 
[Temporary Class Assigned: Grandmaster of Death, Advent of Living Chess]
[Temporary Skill Assigned: Visions of Defeat (Legendary)]
[Temporary Aura Assigned: Aura of Giants (Chess)]
[Temporary Skill Assigned: Chessboard: Subsumed Reality, Our Board is the World]
[Temporary Skill Assigned: Clash of Wills]
 
An [Innkeeper]—no—the [Grandmaster of Chess] stared down at Pisces as he felt an aura pushing at him. He looked up—and a hand the size of Liscor reached down and picked up a chess piece. Erin placed a pawn down, and her pieces were white like ivory.
The ground quaked. Pisces felt it vibrate like an [Earthquake] spell. And he—he had to play that? He tried to pick up a pawn piece, and he could. He looked up—and that was his last mistake.
A pair of black wings sprouted from Erin’s back. Her eyes were slitted pupils now, and he felt like they were a pair of [Disintegration] spells boring holes in him. Then he blinked—
And a roaring Dragon, the last Void Dragonlord, was staring down at him. Xarkouth roared as Pisces’ hand shook wildly. He tried to look away, and the deathly pale face of Khelta was looking right at him.
The great [Necromancer] and first ruler of Khelt stared Pisces down as he turned white. He tried to play a chess piece.
