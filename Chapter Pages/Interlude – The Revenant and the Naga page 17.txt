Interlude – The Revenant and the Naga
Page 17
The fifth day and fifth tale of the Emir Yazdil took place with the Terandrian Lord Alchremm, who had dined and taken Emir Yazdil’s hospitality for nearly a month. However, his disdain for the nation of Roshal was clear and he would soon return to his continent without signing a contract for mithril, despite the Emirs’ best efforts.
Even Yazdil had seemed to fail. But Lord Alchremm had yet to leave despite his hatred for Roshal for two reasons.
The first was that Yazdil was a consummate host and hired actual [Servants] to wait attendance on Lord Alchremm instead of his [Slaves]. He ensured the [Lord] had no lack of Lailight Scintillation’s wonders, and made the trip worthy of even a Terandrian [King]’s enjoyment.
The second was that over the course of his stay, the [Lord], who was unmarried, had met a charming [Slave] upon one of the outings. She was a beautiful woman—Human, like him—and was both educated and skilled at almost any activity imaginable. A [Concubine] in truth, and one that the [Lord] was soon fascinated by.
However, she was a [Slave] and on this day, the [Lord] finally approached Emir Yazdil with a request.
“Emir Yazdil. I have come to meet one of the [Slaves] among the employ of Roshal. Miss Chenera. And I have found her both intelligent and witty and…undeserving of this life as a [Slave]. With your assistance, I would like to purchase her contract and set her free, that I might marry her. I…ask your help in this regard, as I do not know her master and had not inquired.”
Though the matter was said to have been private, the [Lord] Alchremm made the mistake of asking Emir Yazdil as they dined in a restaurant, rather than private company, and their entire conversation was later retold to all those interested. The Emir, in this moment, had his bodyguard, Iert, silence what was said thereafter and hide it from conversation, but it was not hard to guess what was said.
Soon, Miss Chenera, who was indeed the highest class of [Slave] within Roshal, a gem amongst diamonds, appeared. However, her master did not. Lord Alchremm was confused, and then turned to Emir Yazdil.
“Where is her owner?”
The Emir then smiled—and the Naga replied.
“Surely you know I have more than Iert, Lord Alchremm.”
The [Lord], who had met few of the Emir’s servants, was startled—then embarrassed. He made the same request, to the Emir this time.
“I cannot give you my mithril mines, for I still object to Roshal. But I cannot simply leave Chenera here. She has…expressed affection for me, and I would marry her. What must I do to set her free?”
It seemed to all that the Naga had the Lord Alchremm at his mercy, but to everyone’s surprise, the serpent [Emir] simply raised a hand.
“I will revoke her contract and set her free, Lord Alchremm, if that is both your wish.”
The [Lord] was of course, startled, but delighted. He thanked the Emir and was in the midst of celebrating when the [Slave], Chenera, interrupted.
“Master Yazdil. Please, do not free me.”
The [Lord] was quite astonished and hurt as she promptly threw herself on the ground and begged to remain the Emir’s servant. He turned to her, and demanded.
“Miss Chenera! Did you not love me? We have exchanged secrets. I was most taken with you.”
Reportedly, the [Slave] looked up at him and then replied sincerely.
“I enjoyed your company, Lord Alchremm. However, I was told by my master, the Emir Yazdil, to do so. If I were to choose between the two, I would rather remain a [Slave].”
“Even should I marry you and make you a [Lady] of Terandria?”
