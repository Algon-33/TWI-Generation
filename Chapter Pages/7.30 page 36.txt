One of them screamed at the [Lords]. A son unsheathed his sword—but the retainers looked nervously at the thousands of very upset people.
“I say, what’s this all about?”
A tall man shouted uncertainly. One of his retainers muttered in his ear.
“Milord, the Golden Triangle—”
Several of the [Lords], including Alman, blanched with fury. They’d lost gold to that too. Another blow they couldn’t handle with their depleted treasuries. The [Lords] muttered.
“We have our issues with the Golden Triangle! Make way! The Lords of Izril have a complaint to settle with Magnolia Reinhart regarding this [Trade War]!”
Lord Ranga bellowed. The angry mob didn’t really budge. He hesitated. Then Lord Ranga’s expression lit up. He turned to Alman.
“I have a better idea to force Magnolia’s hand. Lord Alman—listen—”
“Ranga—”
The other man began uneasily, but it was too late. Ranga shouted.
“Utter your grievances to Lady Reinhart! She is your [Lady]! She should have protected you! Demand your money from her, people of Invrisil!”
The crowd listened. They began to boil. Some people nodded; the other [Lords] lent their voices and even Skills to Ranga.
“Justice from Reinhart! March with us!”
The crowd’s energy began to pick up. Lord Alman gulped. Indeed, as Erin had noted—
It just took one spark. Unfortunately, as bad ideas went—
This one wasn’t much better.

Erin and Maviola noticed the shouting as they were headed back to The Wandering Inn but neither took notice of it at first. They were talking.
“So—so what do I do with this Hedault guy?”
“You tell him what you want and he tells you how much it costs. Try to be polite. There’s nothing to it, Erin. Have you never hired a contractor? A [Mercenary]?”
“Um. No. My parents hired the plumber and painter and stuff.”
Maviola sighed.
“Children. It’s very simple. Why are you so reluctant to do these things?”
“I dunno. I try not to rock the boat. See, it’s been peaceful of late.”
“Not everything you do will turn out into some huge event.”
“Aha, see—you don’t know me that well. I could make a cup of water explode. Probably.”
“So could I. I think you’re just lazy, Erin.”
“Lazy? Hey now—that’s fair, but—”
The two were enjoying each other’s company. In a way. Erin felt too close to Maviola after staring into her memory flames if that made sense. She barely knew the woman and even Maviola seemed uneasy by the shared memories.
“You saw Fulviolo. My brother.”
“…Yeah. He died, right?”
“To Goblins. And I killed Antinium. To me, they were The Black Tide. You must understand—I’ve looked at them like that all my life. This is new to me.”
“You should talk to Numbtongue. He’s a swell guy.”
Maviola half-smiled.
“I may. But I don’t know if I’ll stay in Liscor much longer. Long enough to teach you and Olesm, Erin. But I want my ending to be bright. I may ride upon the Antinium Hives. To see them.”
Erin halted in the street.
“Don’t talk about dying.”
“Why not? I’ve lived over ninety years, Erin. You see me now bright and glowing. But I made my peace. Life isn’t meant to be forever. I—still believe that.”
Maviola’s eyes grew troubled for a second. She shivered. Erin bit her tongue.
“But what about Olesm? You’ll break his heart. Why did you like him, anyways?”
“There was much to love. He needed me. And in a way—I needed him. Can’t I fall in love?”
The [Lady] laughed as she looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] was troubled.
“How…how do you do that? Fall in love? It’s so hard for me.”
“Ah.”
Maviola halted in the street. She looked back at Erin. Sympathetically. The admission had come out of Erin by accident. She blushed.
“I just meant—”
