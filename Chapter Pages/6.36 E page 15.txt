“It’s not the same as a real battle. I could do some things, but when I found a real enemy to fight—strategy, tactics, leadership—I could make a lot of people move in one direction, feed them, set a few traps with a few hundred. But in that battle I was swallowed, Durene. I couldn’t lead, and that’s part of the reason we lost. There’s no other reason.”
Silently, Durene put down her cup. She looked at Wiskeria and took a slow breath.
“I’m a [Paladin], Wiskeria. Laken gave me that class.”
The [Witch] nodded.
“And I’m a [General]. Do I look like one to you?”
She touched her hat. Durene inhaled to protest, and then she looked down at her hands. Her grey skin. She looked around at her cottage, hand-built, out her window at the garden that Bismarck had torn up looking for food, and then at Wiskeria. The young woman looked back.
A witch and a farmer girl. They held each other’s gazes a moment and then burst out laughing. They laughed as if it were the funniest joke in the world. The saddest. In the end, Durene caught herself before a laugh could turn into a sob. They sat together then, as the light faded and a candle Durene lit flickered low on the table. It was dark. Frostwing tucked her head under one wing.
“I want to be a [Paladin], Wiskeria.”
“I know. And I think you can do it, Durene, I really do. But I don’t want to be a [General]. I can’t do that again. I can’t be responsible for all those lives.”
Durene nodded. Wiskeria was looking down at the table. At last, the [Witch] looked up.
“What is a [Paladin], by the way? I never asked. It’s like a [Knight], but…is it some rare class variant, like Beniar’s [Cataphract]?”
Durene shook her head. She played with her empty cup as she recalled asking Laken just that.
“Laken says they used to be just trusted military leaders in service to some [Emperor]. But apparently the word changed. It began to mean…well, a [Knight], but one dedicated to heroism and chivalry. Someone who does good deeds.”
“Isn’t that what knights are supposed to do?”
Durene smiled. She quoted Laken.
“A [Knight] is a retainer. A warrior pledged to a cause. A [Paladin] is someone who crusades. Who goes out and…helps people. Apparently, it’s perfect for me. I just want to help people. But I haven’t leveled for a while. I think I’m missing something.”
Wiskeria nodded. She stared at Durene, and then took her hat off and looked at it.
“I’m a [Witch]. Do you…know much about my kind?”
“No. I hear stories, um…but Riverfarm never had a [Witch]. Other villages do.”
Durene bit her tongue before she went on. From the stories she’d been told before meeting Wiskeria, [Witches] weren’t to be trusted. They could make potions and do some magic. But they were shifty, dangerous even. Wiskeria smiled bitterly.
“I’m sure you’ve heard stories. And like I said this morning, [Witches] are complex. We do magic, but we have a wide variety of abilities. Alchemy, magic—even beast taming and gardening and more. But we’re not specialists, like say, a [Beast Master].”
The half-Troll girl nodded, then she had a thought.
“Hey, Wiskeria. Can you make potions? I heard a [Witch] can make potions like an [Alchemist]. Mister Prost was saying that if we could get a good [Alchemist] here, we’d be able to heal all sorts of things without needing to buy potions. What if you made them? I’m sure everyone’d appreciate that!”
She looked at the [Witch] hopefully. Durene had always wanted to know how potions were made! That was real magic, as powerful as any spell. But Wiskeria shook her head.
