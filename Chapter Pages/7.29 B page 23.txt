One of the others translated as the young man from China asked questions. He and Xiang had arrived with a group of Chinese students and he was their representative. Fortunately, a number of the people were bilingual or had taken language classes.
“One continent is the size of Eurasia. According to the maps. Shun, this big. This is China.”
Elena drew on the map to show Shun and he recoiled, shaking his head. She nodded.
“It’s a fact. There are hundreds of maps and unless we’re being lied to—all the measurements are in damn miles, though. This is in kilometers.”
She’d done the calculations by hand. A girl from Russia snapped.
“Why. Do. They. Measure. In. MILES!?”
She had been an [Archer]. The others muttered in vexation. America accounted for a good number of Earthers, but the rest of the world was…the rest of the world.
However, that actually made Elena cool down a bit. The [Beautician] raised her hand. And she looked around, meeting everyone’s eyes.
“That’s easy. Someone came here before us. Someone from a country using the imperial system. Chess existed before we came here. We’re not the first.”
“How sure are you, Elena?”
Haley leaned on the table. Elena shrugged.
“How else can you explain everything? People speak English. But they also know Latin—some of the [Mages] think its magical language. They use miles. Who’d come up with that exact measurement? They even have expressions from our world. At some point, there was crossover. I don’t know how or in what way—but I think that’s a safe explanation.”
The others looked at each other. There was so much they couldn’t confirm. Shun checked his watch. He spoke in broken English.
“We are here for—twenty minutes. Time to go?”
“My faction’s going to be looking for me. I have to go, Elena. Are you sure this place is safe?”
“Once we use the door, we’ll appear elsewhere. Right, Aaron?”
The young man nodded.
“This is secret. Tell no one. We have two things left. Elena will start with the first.”
Elena took a deep breath. She was visibly upset now, and the others fell silent, sensing it. Elena glanced at Erik and he clenched his hands.
“Yeah. You’re not going to like this. We shouldn’t tell the others, especially the kids. But—Erik? What was the news in 2019, when you left?”
The German [Actor] hesitated. He bit his lip.
“There were…it is in the news. All over. Many things have happened on Earth. But this? It started small. But people think it’s a conspiracy. There was nearly a war…”
“What?”
Haley demanded. For answer, Erik looked at Elena. He didn’t want to say it. She took a deep breath.
“There are…missing people posters. All over. People noticed kids were going missing. It’s just rumors at this point. But there are cases of people going missing in airports.”
“There’s a video in Melbourne. Security footage. One second everyone’s there—the next—dozens are missing. And more. There are names…I saw lists. Many families looking for their children. People think it’s a government. Or aliens.”
“Or the Rapture.”
Elena snorted. But Erik was pale-faced. This was the truth. The others looked at each other in horror.
“Oh god. It’s been two years. My parents!”
A girl spoke up. Her face was white. She turned to Erik.
“My family is Walczak. From Warsaw? Did you see them? Are they—?”
The young man backed up as the room was filled with everyone asking questions about their family. He raised his hands.
“I’m sorry! I don’t know! I’m sorry! It’s just lists. It’s just a conspiracy—”
“Don’t they know we’re missing? What kind of idiots are in the government that they can’t see the pattern?”
