A [Lady] pointed. From her finger a [Fireball] spun up, a bolt of fire. It detonated just over the heads of the crowd. They all ducked. Maviola pointed.
“Burn.”
Her aura reached out and a Drake was covered in flames. Shouting, screaming in alarm, the crowd backed up. They grabbed for Erin—still enraged. Someone seized her—
“[Power Strike].”
Pyrite kicked the Gnoll into the air. He grabbed Erin, grunted.
“Bad idea. Let’s go.”
He towed Erin back. She saw a blur—another [Lady] stood at the door. Bethal and Thomast, his sword drawn. Palt, Montressa, Beza—Maviola was last. She slammed the door shut as her fire winked out.
“Change the dial.”
Lyonette swiveled the dial and the sound cut off. Erin lay in the hallway, panting. The other [Mages] collapsed. Numbtongue blinked as Pyrite vanished. Maviola stood there. Her dress wasn’t even singed by the fire she’d called forth. She looked around, counting, and then stared at Erin.
“That. Is how you use an aura. You cannot stop a riot with just spells.”
“Not at our level. It was worth a shot. I’m bleeding.”
Palt groaned. Erin rose.
“Palt? Are you…?”
The Centaur looked up at Erin. His chest was torn open. Lyonette bent.
“A potion. You’re bleeding. Erin—your face.”
The [Innkeeper] had been raked across her face. She let Numbtongue apply a bit of potion. Then she stood there.
“I’m sorry. I thought—”
Her confidence was gone. She’d thought she could stop them. She knew Liscor’s people. But that had been—Erin looked around. Montressa wouldn’t meet her eyes. Beza shook her head.
“Never in the House of Minos. Madness.”
“I thought that might happen. But it was worth a shot. A lesson.”
Palt shakily got to his hooves. He looked around. Maviola nodded at Erin.
“Your plan was flawed. I told you, Erin.”
Her gaze was accusatory. Erin wilted.
“Yeah. Yeah.”
“It was a good effort. Wuvren might have done it, with help. She can charm a crowd. I have seen it done. My mother once halted a riot.”
Lady Bethal spoke distantly. She looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] inhaled.
“I guess I can’t. Okay. Okay…Numbtongue? Thank you. Maviola, thank you. Palt—I’m so sorry.”
“What are allies for? Let alone friends? My Master would be disappointed in me. I should have prepared [Invisibility], but that’s hard to cast in quick succession.”
The [Illusionist] grinned weakly. Erin stood there. She rubbed at her face.
“I understand now. I guess…Lyonette? Is Mrsha in the garden?”
“Along with the beavers and Apista. Should we go there too?”
Erin Solstice looked at the [Princess]. Blankly. Then she shook her head.
“Not yet. How many people are in the inn, Lyonette?”
“I don’t know?”
“Feels like…eighty. The Players of Celum…the [Knights]? Lady Bethal, right?”
“That’s correct. They’re in Invrisil.”
The [Lady] was watching Erin. Not without sympathy. The [Innkeeper] had blood on her face. Erin looked around. She rubbed at her face.
“Palt. Beza. Montressa. I owe you one. But I might need another favor. We should—pass out those crossbows. Loaded.”
Maviola stirred. Lyonette slowly looked at Numbtongue.
“Already done. Bird’s in his tower.”
“I doubt the mob will come for the inn. It’s too far, Erin. They might, but your inn’s sturdy. They’ll turn their anger elsewhere.”
Palt panted. Erin blinked at him.
“Maybe. Either way—can we get the [Knights] in here, Bethal?”
The [Lady] blinked.
“I could—order a handful here. But Invrisil is also enduring a riot, even if most are headed towards Magnolia’s estate.”
“Please?”
The [Lady] exchanged a glance with the [Chevalier]. She nodded slowly, looking faintly…disappointed.
“Only naturally. I shall give the order.”
