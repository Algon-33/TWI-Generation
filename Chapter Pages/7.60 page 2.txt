It wasn’t the [Assassins]. Lupp heard them die. Screams—two more thunks as arrows hit them. He dared to peek out his door. He saw his scarecrow lower the bow. Then—brush at its face.
The wicker creation he used to scare crows away as, even dressed up as himself, became a figure standing in the field. The illusion spell melted off the [Archer] as she looked around.
More figures spread out in his field of corn. Each one had a bow. They’d killed the [Assassins].
“Secure the farm! Make sure there’s no backup. What word from the other teams?”
“Reizmelt secure. Second farm secure. Assassin team headed to the farm intercepted and dead.”
“Good.”
The figure walked up the hill towards Lupp. Reflexively, he almost closed the door in her face.
“Farmer Lupp? It’s safe.”
“Who—who are—”
The figure nodded at him. She—it was a she—was wearing a strange armor that seemed to take on the characteristics of whatever was around her. Right now it looked like the dirt of his farm’s path; if she laid down, she’d be all but invisible.
“I am a [Stealth Archer] in the employ of the House of El, Farmer Lupp. You are under the protection of the Five Families.”
“The House of…”
The woman nodded, her eyes on the distance.
“The aegis of the Veltras Family is on you. Until the Guild is destroyed, we will be protecting your farm.”
The other figures in his field, searching the bodies of the [Assassins], wore the colors of House Veltras. [Soldiers]. Expert [Marksmen]. Lupp stared.
“But—how—”
“Lord Veltras requested aid from the Five Families. Friends and family of the Wind Runner of Reizmelt are to be guarded. Obviously.”
The [Stealth Archer] smiled, eying the dead [Assassins]. She turned to Farmer Lupp.
“Apologies about the delay. Veltras’ agents were still getting into position. I would have taken all four if I had to, but…”
She shrugged. She must have come first; the other [Archers] looked exhausted, having ridden through the night to get here. Lupp was at a loss for words. He looked at the [Stealth Archer]. At the dead [Assassins]. Relief made him weak.
As before, so, now. All the [Farmer] could think to do was point towards his open door.
“Thank you. Thank you. Would you like—some corn?”

Even their most tertiary agents were dying. The Guild of Assassins lay in ruins. The headquarters in First Landing was obliterated and two more of their bases were burning.
There was no leadership. Conflicting [Messages], ordering them to regroup, or strike at their enemies—the agents of the Circle of Thorns were similarly panicked.
The truth was—their great gambit had failed. In every conceivable way. And now that the threat upon his sons was ended, both Tyrion Veltras and the Five Families—and even lesser houses of Izril were turning their might upon the Guild without fear.
The worst had happened to them. So—now came wrath and ruination.

House of El. Lord Deilan had, with Zedalien’s advice, stones brought out. [Appraisal], [Truth]—to find agents in his lands. Any that were located were not engaged directly, like Veltras’ forces who were running down every [Assassin] they could find.
“Seeker arrows. Target is fleeing.”
One of the El Family’s [Archers] stood on the roof of their manor. He drew a crafted arrow, one of the El Family’s creations, and loosed it. It flew up and kept flying, defying physics, arcing with more range and accuracy than even most Skills could allow. The [Eagle-eye Marksman] saw the fleeing figure crumple.
