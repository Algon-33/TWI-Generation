Lyonette whispered through bloodless lips. She didn’t know if she believed the words coming out of her mouth. And Pawn—he looked her in the eye and shook his head.
“No. I do not think you are. I do not think it is better. Because doing all of this is easier than seeing you cry. Because it matters to me.”
“But it’s my life. You can’t just interfere with it!”
“Can’t I?”
Pawn tilted his head. Lyonette opened her mouth and he rushed on.
“Erin told me it was not right for me to interfere with other people all the time. I understood that. I know it is wrong. Socially. But I had to try. I had to do it for you.”
“Why, Pawn?”
The Worker was silent.
“Because if it were Erin, it would not matter as much, I think.”
“What?”
Pawn shrugged.
“That is what I feel. If Erin was grieving, I would give her space. As I would for others. If it were Relc who was crying I would be concerned. But I would let him be himself. If it were Mrsha who wept I would help and give her space when needed. If it were anyone else…I could do that. But not you. You are my friend. I cannot leave you alone. Not when you are hurting. Not when you are wrong. I am sorry.”
Lyonette was speechless for a moment. She tried to summon the words, to protest what Pawn was saying.
“Pawn, I know you think you know what’s right. But what if you don’t? I’m happy as a [Barmaid]. I still have that. I don’t need my [Princess] class anymore. I’m just a [Barmaid] now.”
“No.”
This time the word was authoritative. Pawn looked up. He stared at Lyonette, and there was something fierce in his gaze. Defiant.
“I am an [Acolyte], Lyonette. I pray. I have faith. I believe. I believe in things that may not exist, may never exist. I believe in heaven for the Antinium. I believe in redemption, in the salvation of souls. I believe there is a place after death for my people, that we might make it ourselves. I believe in gods. I believe in gods. But when you tell me you are a simple [Barmaid], I cannot believe in that.”
His voice rang in the chamber. Lyonette was speechless. She tried to form an argument, but Pawn’s voice was too loud. He spoke to her and her alone.
“You are a [Princess]. You showed me how to lead. You wept for your class when you left it. You have not been happy since you lost your class. I see it. I am your friend and I see your grief. You must have it back. It may not be my place to interfere, but it would be just as wrong for me not to. And if you tell me again not to interfere, to go, I will. But I have to tell you directly. Lyonette, I think you are wrong. And I want to help you. Please. Let me.”
Pawn held out his hands. Lyonette stared at them. She looked up at him and didn’t know what to say.
“You really believe I need my class back?”
“I do.”
Pawn took a shuddering breath, and then another. He looked around, helplessly.
“I am sorry. Again. I did this wrong. I should not have said all that so…suddenly. I should have done it after.”
“After?”
Pawn nodded. He scuffed a toe on the floor.
“After the dancing. You see, this ball is to restore your class. Well, not just for that. It is really for something else. Miss Krshia told me it would be most suitable.”
Lyonette started in surprise.
“Krshia did?”
How had the Gnoll thought that any of this was a good idea? Pawn nodded energetically.
“She told me to come here and tell you how I felt. I did that. Only—she said you might be angry, but I should tell you how I felt even if you shouted. She said you would understand.”
“Understand? Understand wh—”
