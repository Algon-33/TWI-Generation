Tears. Tears…had he ever shed any when Salva died? He remembered clutching her body to him. Screaming for them to find his sons and kill whoever had done this! But—had he wept, as he buried her? As he swore vengeance and begged Magnolia to know who it had been? To make sure it was the Drakes before he decided to make them bleed?
No. Not at the pyre. Not at the wake. Not afterwards, not telling his sons, who’d been shocked and silent. Not in the times after when he mourned and missed her.
It blurred your vision when you had to aim at the target. Steady hand. Like you were tilting—
Tyrion stared at his hands. He touched them, one with the other.
He couldn’t stop shaking. As if he had the most terrible chills.
“Milord?”
Jericha was watching him. Tyrion jerked. He tried to stand, caught himself.
“Lord Veltras. You should eat. Rest.”
“Later, Jericha. Where—where is the [Assassin]?”
The woman hesitated.
“In her rooms.”
“I will see her. If Hethon and Sammial worsen…they have days. Let them hold out. They must. We must wait to see if the antidote may arrive. We must.”
“Lord Veltras…”
He turned to her. He had to explain.
“It is not for me, Jericha. The contract would bind House Veltras to the Circle like a blade. Not just me. But you, the forces—we would be the blade of these people.”
Wielded in defense of Izril, or so the [Assassin] claimed. Jericha looked at Tyrion.
“We would not desert you, Lord Veltras.”
“That is not why. Jericha. I have no love for the Circle and they know it. We would be a blade. But what do you do with a sword when it breaks? A weapon you do not love?”
You would use it and toss it aside. Duty compelled Tyrion to refuse, to try. But—he would leave Hethon and Sammial naught but the ashes of his house.
But they would be alive. Tyrion strode from his quarters. He entered into the [Assassin]’s room after she bade him enter.
She was lounging, her feet up. Tyrion stopped.
“I have an appeal, [Assassin]. I would like to renegotiate the terms of the contract.”
“Lord Tyrion Veltras. Renegotiate? Now?”
She clicked her tongue. Tyrion stared at the mask she always wore.
“Surely your masters would prefer me to sign now, rather than risk the worst?”
Her eyes flickered in the gaps of the mask.
“Well, I can certainly take your appeal to them. They aren’t disposed to agree—but if you were to be persuasive, I could ask.”
“Do that. Please. I would be willing to sign. Now. If—”
“Hold on. Kneel.”
The [Lord] stopped.
“What?”
“Kneel. Or bow. If you want me to send your terms, kneel.”
She waited, smiling behind her mask. Lord Tyrion stared at her. Then, slowly, he knelt.
The [Toxin Expert] would remember this for the rest of her life. A worthless orphan from Chandrar, and one of the Five Family’s heads was kneeling and begging. She laughed, giggling to herself. Worth it! Especially for someone who had nothing to regret or look forwards to.
But this?
“Well, go on.”
The man spoke behind gritted teeth.
“I would be willing…to sign the contract. A more powerful clause. Renounce my…position as head of House Veltras and serve this Circle as it needs.”
The [Assassin] sat up. That…was something.
“Really? And what do you want for such a generous offer?”
“My House will not follow me into oblivion. Not one of my retainers is to suborned. Nor my sons. I will serve your Circle in any capacity they might wish militarily.”
“Oh my. You are desperate.”
He said nothing more. The [Toxin Expert] thought.
“You know, my masters just might accept that. With some provisos. They want Lord Veltras after all. But perhaps they might accept.”
Tyrion’s head rose.
