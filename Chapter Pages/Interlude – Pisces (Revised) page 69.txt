Interlude – Pisces (Revised)

The Stitch-woman forced out. She stared up at the Death of Chains in horror. The Djinni nodded one vast head. Her eyes were not wrathful. Just—disappointed.
“Yes. We do not choose our chains. But we choose what we are. So—”
She raised a finger. Pisces felt a flash of heat. Screams. The Death of Chains turned away from the ashes.
“What others?”
She and Azam spoke as Pisces got to his feet. He was shaking. He looked at Cawe, stumbling over to her. Then he turned and stared up.
“You. You saved us? Just like that? How? Where were you?”
The Death of Chains stopped. She looked down, poised, her body roiling, to move. Azam gasped.
“That one is an adventurer, sister. He took a spellbook from the Putrid One! A spellbook written by our kind!”
“I know. The magic called me to this place, as much as you, brother. Did you send me the signal?”
She pointed. Pisces’ head whirled around. He saw the open spellbook, lying there. The spellbook that Azam had placed…
The Djinni smiled, and it was the smile of hope made manifest.
“I heard a glowing comet had appeared. That the Death of Magic lived…I dared to hope, sister. I would have settled for thieves or bandits, come to steal it away.”
The female Djinni laughed, delighted, and hugged him in a full embrace, kissing his cheek.
“Well done. Well done. And this is the mortal who found it. Hello, Pisces Jealnet.”
The Death of Chains bent down. Pisces looked up at her.
“You know my name?”
She smiled.
“We are of Rhir. Of course we can see what happens. I saw you. I did not think to see you here. I saw you being tortured. Was this your friend?”
She indicated Cawe. Pisces nodded. He felt numb. Shocked and numb.
“Yes. Who are you? Who…”
It was a stupid question, but she knew what he meant. Up, the Djinni rose. She stretched, and arms appeared from her back. She was gas and air. Magic and will. She boomed, and everyone for miles heard her voice.
“My kin know me as Czautha, little [Mage]. Czautha’qshe, and many words after that. I have many names. Yet all who call me in this age know me by the one I took. The one I was given. Death of Chains.”
The Djinni who broke her bonds and was never captured. The Djinni, Czautha, looked down. She shook her head at Pisces, then stopped Azam.
He had taken the Putrid One’s book. She put a hand out.
“Leave it, little brother.”
“But sister—”
“My kin, the Death of Magic, has many such books. Leave it. It may be better placed here. After all—look.”
She pointed. Azam, Pisces, and the others’ heads turned. He saw a great flash of light. Czautha bared teeth.
“The Death of Magic. She has come to liberate as many as we can. I have no time to linger. Even now, they know I have returned, and my kin lie in bondage and torture across this world, and this land most of all. I cannot protect those I free. Azam, you will come with me. But you?”
She looked down at the [Slaves]. Wordless, they gazed up at her. Czautha shook her head.
“Even if we could take you all, even mighty Silvenia can only transfer a few. You, though, Pisces Jealnet. Do you have the will to guard them? You have surely seen what horror these people commit.”
Czautha gestured at the dead [Slavers]. Pisces nodded. He could not speak, yet she knew. The Death of Chains nodded. She spread her arms.
“To me, Azam. We must find others.”
“I know of more nearby.”
Azam hurried to her. Czautha folded him into an embrace and they seemed to meld together. She looked down. Pisces spoke, shouting up to her as the hum of magic became a roar.
“Thank you. I will never forget this.”
