The [Doctor] whispered. She felt lightheaded. Idis was panicking at all the mixed feelings running through Geneva. But now Geneva Scala sat there. And she could not see the person on the other side. But the conversation went on. And Erin Solstice sat there, trying to imagine a face.
It was a dialogue between the two of them, then.
 
[Joseph] – Don’t thank me. Thank you. I am not a [Doctor]. I wish I could be. You’re saving lives.
[Geneva] – Not enough. I try.
[Joseph] – That’s all we can do. It’s been difficult.
[Geneva] – Yes. Sometimes it is extremely hard to effect change.
[Joseph] – True. But what other option is there? That’s why we do these things. Don’t give up. It means so much to hear from someone else trying to do the right thing.
[Geneva] – Yes. Here as well.
[Joseph] – Never give up. If I can do anything for you—let me know. I can’t promise anything, but I have friends here. Good people. Let’s keep talking. I’ll let you know as soon as I get the medicine sent. And get you in contact with someone on this end.
[Joseph] – It must have been terrible at the start. But you did it. I did it. Let’s keep working, Geneva.
[Joseph] – We are not alone.
 
The conversation ended with that, and a few more details. Addresses, notes about the disease. Then the [Mage] looked up. Geneva sat back. Her mind was racing.
“This is too good to be true.”
Siri looked at Ken. The [Diplomat] half-nodded. But he just stared at the log of messages.
“Miss Scala? Are you done for the moment? Adventurer Ulinde has promised to send a [Message]. I will let you know when I receive it.”
The Selphid [Mage] was weary. Geneva nodded.
“Thank you. Please, let me know at once. We have to…Couriers. Even if they can’t find one, we should see…”
“Yes. Let us go. Luan?”
“On it.”
The [Mage] and the three went for the door. When the Selphid was gone, and Geneva, Luan, and Ken, had all run for the nearest Runner’s Guild, Paige turned to Kirana, Siri, and Daly.
“I don’t think that was ‘Joseph’, do you?”
“No.”
Kirana was looking at the writing. Daly closed his eyes.
“We don’t know if they’re telling the truth.”
“Why would they lie, Daly?”
“I don’t know. But this…do you think they’re serious? A Courier? Penicillin?”
“We’ll find out.”
Siri murmured. And Kirana looked up. It had been a short conversation, all told. Even so—she was smiling. And Daly recalled, on Geneva’s face, an odd expression. Kirana laughed, and it was a good sound. Daly realized her expression was mirrored on his face. He looked down at the last line and marveled how much it mattered to say.
“We’re not alone.”

“Lyonette? We’ve got work to do.”
Ulinde was panting, cheeks flushed. Or rather, she was having to inhale more oxygen for her inner body, and the glowing orange in her cheeks and body were a sign the Selphid had exhausted herself. Erin turned to her.
“Ulinde. Thanks so much. I’m going to need your help, but rest. Let Lyonette get you anything you need.”
“Sure, Erin.”
The [Spellslinger] waved weakly. Jelaqua looked at Erin.
“What’re you going to do, Erin?”
The [Innkeeper] smiled.
“I’m going to get a Courier. And other things.”
She turned and left the private room. Then she walked down the corridor. Numbtongue followed her just in time to see Erin pick up the pace. She jogged—and then ran.
“Octavia!”
The [Innkeeper] slammed into Stitchworks. Octavia nearly dropped the potion she was working on.
“Erin! Don’t do that! What’s the matter? Are monsters attacking?”
The [Alchemist] looked around wildly. Erin shook her head.
“Penicillin! How much do you have?”
The Stitch-Girl brightened.
