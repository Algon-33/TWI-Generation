Ksmvr stood proudly. He’d acted his part out well. The Shield Spiders had not been part of it, nor had the Silver Swords’ incompetence, but all had worked out in the end. He nodded at his team.
“The knowledge of the dungeon’s entrances will not inconvenience my Hive. I am sure of that.”
Pisces was not, but he watched Ceria pat Ksmvr on the shoulder and the Antinium stand taller without comment. He looked at his team. Fellow conspirators all. He would never have expected this kind of plan from them, but they were always surprising him. Pisces smiled.
“Well, it seems you’ve finally begun taking advantage of my varied and extraordinary skill set, Springwalker, Miss Byres. I hope you will at least enjoy the next phase.”
“Next phase? I thought the next part was that we didn’t talk about this ever again.”
Yvlon eyed Pisces with deep distrust. He sighed.
“Of course, that is part of our design. But we are allowed a bit of enjoyment. Please consider how amusing it will be.”
“What will be?”
The [Necromancer] smiled.
“Why, everything that follows of course.”
He smiled. Above the dungeon adventurers celebrated and grand plots were spun, the outcomes of which only he could guess at. And below the dungeon waited. It had failed to claim the adventurers who had begun to wake it. But there was always more dungeon. And there was always next time.
