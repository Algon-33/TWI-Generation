“Woo! That’s right! Kill them! Start with the women and children! And babies too!”
The vindictive rage—faltered. The crowd hesitated. They were behind a lot of things, but that was a bit too on-the-nose. But the shouter continued.
“Let’s kill them all! And then kill all the villagers! Especially the babies! And the cows! And uh—rats! Kill all the rats and sheep! Kill ‘em all!”
Someone was disrupting the flow of this moment. Like cold water down the back. It was unpleasant. Going against what was right. Righteous anger snarled—turned.
“Who’s shouting that?”
People turned. And they saw her standing there.
It was a…young woman. Wearing trousers, a light shirt. She had something in her hands. The crowd focused on that. On her.
“Who are you?”
Erin Solstice smiled. This time—there were even more people. And they were armed. They looked like bad news. She carried no lantern. And the only Skill she used was [Loud Voice].
“Listen up. You can’t kill those people.”
She pointed at the [Lords]. Lord Alman stared at the young woman in the street. Holding…what was that? He peered past her as Lord Toldos—Ranga—the others stared at her. She was alone. The street was full of closed doors. Frightened people. He saw some of them poking their heads out. A furry face withdrew quickly.
“Back off.”
A man with a sword warned Erin. She looked at the sword, dismissed it. She called out to the crowds.
“Listen. I don’t know who they are. Really. I don’t.”
She pointed at the [Lords]. Lord Alman’s heart sank. Erin looked about.
“But you can’t kill them.”
Who was she to set rules? People swung around. Someone threw a stone. The rock soared at Erin’s face.
It exploded in midair. Three things hit it; an arrow, a bolt of light, and a shimmering force field. Erin recoiled—and a trio of people looked out through a magical door.
Bird. Palt. Montressa. They walked out. A Centaur, an Antinium, and a [Mage].
Not the people to calm a mob. Four versus hundreds. Even so—they weren’t alone. Erin turned. She planted something on the ground.
“I know you’re angry. Something terrible has happened. I can’t fix that. Or give you your money back. You should be angry! You deserve justice!”
She pointed at them. The people standing there hesitated.
Six men and women in armor stepped out of the doorway. [Knights]. And then—a Hobgoblin. They formed a line behind her. The young woman went on, spellbinding the crowd. Not with a Skill, but just the strangeness.
“It sucks. Sometimes life is terrible. And I can’t help you. I can’t stop you from rioting. Or change your minds. But there’s just one thing. You can’t kill them. That’s not right.”
She pointed at the [Lords]. At this, there was jeering. The door opened. A [Chevalier] stepped into place. Antinium joined the others. A giant with yellow paint on his body. A muscular Drake and then another that put even him to shame. The Humans eyed the muscular Drake. But he was still one and they had brought down a Golem.
“You can’t stop us. Get lost.”
The [Innkeeper] didn’t argue. She looked at the hundreds. Then turned her head. It was about twenty people. She shook her head. The door opened. A Drake in armor strode through. The Heartflame Breastplate.
A half-Giant ducked his head to exit. The people looked up. But he was shorter than a Golem.
The young woman called out. As the crowds were hesitating.
“Listen, everybody. I can see we’re not going to resolve this with words. And that’s fine. I didn’t really think it would work. But look.”
