“You mean…invent more magical food? You can do that?”
Erin gave him a distracted nod.
“Yeah, but I haven’t tried making more in a while. Think I should?”
The [Bard] stared at Erin. She looked up.
“What?”
“You can make…magical food. Like potions. And you do not?”
Numbtongue had to speak slowly to make sure he was getting this. Erin frowned.
“Yeah.”
“Why not?”
“Eh. It’s hard.”
“So?”
The Human girl hesitated, put off by the intensity in Numbtongue’s voice.
“Well—it takes money. Time. And no one likes eating my stuff. Even me. It’s risky, y’know?”
“So?”
She could make magical food and her objection was that it was ‘too much of a pain?’ The former Redfang Warrior was offended. Erin hesitated.
“W-well. I was busy. I mean, I always meant to try it again. Don’t look at me like that. I meant to! It’s just—hey, why don’t you help me experiment? Sometime this week? I’m sure I can…”
The Hobgoblin folded his arms. Erin hesitated.
“Um. Tomorrow? I need to get things ready and think about how to be magical…”
He said nothing. The [Innkeeper] wilted.
“You know, I have an empty schedule.”
That was how Numbtongue, Palt, and Erin found themselves outside, bubbling stuff in a pot and debating what constituted ‘magical cooking’. Palt had joined because of course he would. And they were outside because Lyonette had heard the words ‘experiment’ and ‘magic’ from Erin’s mouth and banned them at once.
“I just don’t know how it works. It’s [Wondrous Fare]. I’ve done a few good things—I made this dish for the Winter Sprites once, but it was just intuition. This could be magical. What do you think?”
Erin had altered one of her standing recipes. She had taken the element of heat and tried to infuse it into her cooking.
That meant a milk-and-butter base, to warm you up. Hot peppers, including the paste being sold in her new dishes. The element of heat, to Erin, was also represented in food you ate when you were cold. So she’d put a tiny bit of chocolate in. And now she was tossing other spicy things into the pot, like some tubers.
Palt looked into the pot, already simmering with a half-dozen ingredients. The milk looked like it was curdling. He put a hand over his mouth.
“You—this is your process?”
“Yup. All intuition.”
“Please stop.”
The Centaur said it as much to Numbtongue as Erin. The Hobgoblin was trying the recipe. It was hot. Edible, at least to him. He smacked his lips.
“Where’s the magic?”
“Um. Usually I put something from Octavia’s shop in there. Maybe salamander skins? I think that’s what we used last time.”
“Just…skins?”
“Well, I’ll probably boil them first.”
At this point the [Illusionist] had to trot off for a second. He came back after a few minutes of Erin tossing Sage’s Grass into the pot. The worst part was that it was actually working.
Numbtongue was sweating profusely in the heat.
“Hot soup.”
“Yeah. Yeah. This is magic! Heat soup!”
It was disgusting. Even Numbtongue would have rather eaten something else. But the soup did warm you up. Not just from the peppers. Palt tasted the magic as he took one grudging sip. And a bit of salamander skin. He retched.
“Dead gods. This is horrible!”
And he’d studied alchemy for one semester in Wistram. Erin shrugged.
“It’s a brew.”
“It’s an insult to cooking is what it is! Even [Witches] cook better than this! And they use toad scrapings!”
The Centaur snapped. Erin looked vaguely hurt, so he moderated his tone.
“I’m sorry. It’s just that—do you have a plan, Erin?”
“Nope.”
The [Innkeeper] looked up innocently. Palt sighed.
