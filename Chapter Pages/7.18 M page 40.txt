Power. Ieka looked at Belavierr. And she knew. She wanted to take the Stitch Witch’s offer. Even for the cost.
True magic. Ieka was drawn towards those eyes. Into that smile. She saw Magnolia raising a hand, calling out—
And then—a woman stood in front of Belavierr. Standing tall. Her hair was black. Her eyes orange, like Belavierr’s. But burning orange, not the unearthly glow.
Pryde. And she looked up at Belavierr as the Stitch Witch stared down. Pryde’s eyes were contemptuous.
“I have had enough of your whispers, creature. Begone.”
She raised a hand. And slapped Belavierr across the face.
“Pryde!”
Ieka stumbled. Belavierr’s influence on her faded and she stepped back. But Pryde—had broken one of the rules.
She stood there, the picture of arrogance. Pride made flesh. Belavierr stumbled. The blow had knocked her backwards. The [Ladies] paused uncertainly. And the Stitch Witch laughed.
Mockingly. She stood over Pryde. And the Lady Ulta’s vainglorious ego faltered for a second as Belavierr spoke.
“Pride is fleeting. It dies. And you? You do not even know how small you are.”
One of her hands swung downwards. A blow. Pryde braced herself, using her greatest Skill.
[Pride is Unbreak—
The blow drove her down. Into the earth. She lay there.
“Pryde.”
“She’s alive. The idiot. Wuvren.”
Zanthia swept forwards. They lifted the [Lady]. Pryde’s head  was lolling. Her ego—extinguished. And the six were five.
That was enough. Belavierr smiled. And she seemed to grow taller still. Until she was far, far too large for her mortal frame. A dark giant staring down at them. The [Ladies] backed up and the darkness closed in.
Magnolia was the last. She stared up as Belavierr leaned down.
“You walk with those who would live forever. But you cannot follow our paths. Take my hand. And you will know no fear from time.”
The woman stared at the hand reaching towards her. And her hand twitched. But then she sighed. A bit ruefully, and smiled.
“Belavierr. You are indeed powerful. But you are a constant. You do not change because you know nothing. You lose nothing and gain nothing. I would prefer to live, rather than to never die. However brief I may have, it is my time.”
She stepped back. The Stitch Witch’s eyes narrowed.
“Then die.”
She raised a hand, as tall as the heavens. Ieka looked up. And Magnolia nodded. She glanced past Ieka and nodded.
Now. The [Ladies] turned and beckoned. Ieka called out and felt that she was heard.
The jaws of the trap swung shut. Magnolia spoke as Belavierr’s head turned. Too late, the Stitch Witch sensed…something. She looked down as Magnolia waved at her politely.
“Belavierr. You are many things. But first and foremost. You are arrogant. We are small compared to you. But that is our strength. We do not stand alone.”
The shadows moved. The clouds opened and moonlight shone down. The Stitch Witch turned her head. And out of the darkness rolled…
A carriage. First one, and then two. And then dozens. Led by horses, stopping, opening. But no [Assassins] burst from them. Instead, came figures in dresses.
Tall and short. Young and old. Rich and…richer.
[Ladies]. Ieka turned and saw a young girl, walking with her peers. Lady Eliasor of House Melissar. Last of her line, like Rie. The girl stared at Belavierr, and then Lady Zanthia. The regal old [Lady] nodded, smiling.
One of many. The coaches let out more and more [Ladies]. Over a hundred, and then two hundred. Minor houses. And major.
The last coach to stop and the last passenger was the oldest. A wheelchair moved across the bumpy ground. And the [Lady] was exhausted from her trip. Dying.
