Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

The warship looked like one of Ailendamus’ grandest vessels. And the insignia read—Itorin’s Pride.
“Dead gods. But that’s the flagship. We didn’t receive word, did we?”
The [Admiral] lowered his spyglass as the navy, spread out in their blockade, hailed the oncoming warship. He heard a curse from one of his junior officers.
“Lord Admiral! I regret to inform you that we did receive several [Messages]!”
“What?”
“The contact, sir! This must be it.”
The [Admiral] of The Foehammer, a good warship, paled. He’d gotten several coded contacts yesterday through the [Message] system. Obviously, since you could intercept messages, Ailendamus had its own system of codes. It had told him to look for a message or persons today. But Itorin’s Pride?
“Are we going to war already? No—if the Pride is joining us, we might be sailing against Pheislant’s harbors. Dead gods. Make ready! I’ll greet our visitors myself.”
The [Admiral] checked his uniform, and saw the other ship hailing them through a complicated signal of [Light] spells. The deck was very busy, but to his surprise, the [Admiral] saw that they were signaling to come aboard his ship rather than the other way around.
Odd. But the [Admiral] saw the gangplank being lowered and hastily stepped forwards to greet…
“Admiral Dakelos! How the hell are you, my man?”
A giant of a man—not an actual Giant, but still—strode across the decks. He grabbed Dakelos in a bear-hug slapped him on the shoulders. The smaller man squeaked.
The [Commander]—no—[General] by his rank on his uniform was a bear of a man. A powerful nose broken twice, scars lining his arms—he had hair like it was made of iron—and a huge, booming smile.
He also smelled a bit of wine. He was clearly not at home on the rolling decks.
“Do I—know you? Sir?”
The man looked hurt.
“Dakelos! We met when you were barely a [Captain]. Back when you were sailing at sea? You don’t remember me? Yerzhen? Ah, but we had a grand time. Finished a barrel of…no?”
The [Admiral] blinked a few times, then blushed. He had a poor way with drink, and if he had met the man (and how could you forget a fellow like this?), he’d forgotten.
“I’m terribly sorry…was it Yerzhen? Er—[General]…?”
Belatedly, he saw one of his [Fleet Mages] coming forwards. It was a bit embarrassing, but the [Mage] began casting a truth spell at once. On both Yerzhen and Dakelos. The [Admiral] waved him back, but the unsteady [General] didn’t seem to notice.
“These damn boats. I hate them. Don’t know how you can stand them, Dakelos. What were you saying? Ah, right!”
He waved a stern finger at Dakelos.
“Don’t call me General Yerzhen. That was my father’s title. Let’s not stand on formality, Dakelos. Two old drinking-partners shouldn’t, eh?”
The truth spell flashed behind the man. All the statements were true. Dakelos, a bit miffed but more convinced than ever, saw Itorin’s Pride sailing past his flagship.
“Er—as you say, Gen—I mean, Yerzhen. What is the Pride doing?”
“Ah—that. You’ll want to follow. I was supposed to go ahead in one of our skiffs and spoken to you earlier today, but you know me—had to drink or I’d die at sea. How many [Soldiers] do you have under your command?”
Dakelos’ brows creased and his heart began to pound.
“I have a number of sailors, s—I mean, Gener—Yerzhen. But what is this…?”
“His Majesty will kill me if we’re late. Hurry up and turn the ship! I’ll explain on the way. You got the coded [Messages], yes?”
“Yes—but—”
Dakelos waved a hand at his officers. Wide-eyed, they began to call out.
“Raise the anchor!”
