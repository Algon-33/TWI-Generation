Teres looked up. Relieved, Flos turned. He addressed his people, holding up one hand gravely.
“The crisis is over! Mage Ulyse has righted my error. This fantastic little artifact is too fragile for my hands, it seems!”
He laughed, smiling.
“After that fright, I’ve a mind to eat something. Where’s that Yellat? And my people! Have they been settled?”
“Yes, your Majesty. I have your meal right here. Would you like to take it now?”
“I’ll dine with my subjects! Lead me to them! Teres, would you come with me? And take more of these…pictures? Yourself, of course.”
“I can do that.”
Teres looked up, nodding. She turned to Trey. He lamely pointed back to the castle.
“I’ll find you—later. Gazi’s making me study and I can’t skip out.”
“Sure. I’ll take all the food photos for you.”
“Why would you take a picture of food? What a waste! Unless it was a true banquet.”
Flos and Teres headed into the city followed by a bevy of servants and—Trey stared. Was that some kind of glazed Yellat on a little platter? Why just one? And why was it so…? He looked around and jumped as Gazi put her hand on his shoulder.
“Let us return to your room, Trey Atwood.”
“Gazi! You jumped out a window!”
“Does that surprise you? You know I am capable of much more.”
The half-Gazer looked amused as Trey followed her back to his room. They were studying magic; she was his teacher and he her sometimes reluctant pupil. Trey gloomily sat back down and stared at his desk. A few tiny Sand Golems walked across it; they were his creations. Gazi studied the little Golems.
“You can keep them animated for longer durations. Good. But a waste of magic.”
“They’re just for fun.”
Trey shooed one of the Golems over the edge of the table. It went splat on the ground and reformed, trundling off. Gazi watched it with one eye and then gestured to Teres’ side.
“That phone my Lord broke. You have one too. Show me?”
Trey hesitated, but one of Gazi’s eyes was looking at it. He took it out and handed it to her. At least he had no fear of Gazi breaking his phone. She inspected it, and then turned it on. She even knew his passcode! Her eyes really did see everything. But Gazi paused and just stared at the screen. She frowned, and then pointed at the phone to Trey.
“It hurts my eyes. The little things in the screen. What are they?”
He blinked.
“What? The apps? Er, the icons?”
“No. The little things. This is made up of many, many, tiny things. Almost too small for you to see. But I see them.”
Trey blinked.
“What? Oh! Pixels. You can see them?”
“Clearly.”
“They make the screen by changing color. I think. When you say it hurts your eyes, Gazi—”
She shook her head.
“My eyes are too sensitive. I must unfocus to see the picture. Otherwise I simply see it differently. It…flashes.”
“You mean, the screen?”
“Incredibly quickly. It keeps changing. A picture redrawn many times each second to create…”
Gazi trailed off. Trey realized she was seeing the screen refresh. He stared, amazed. Her eyes were powerful! And those were just her four secondary eyes. She’d told him her main eye could see through almost anything. He’d never seen it—or seen her open her main eyelid, though. Apparently her eye had been damaged in a fight before she’d return to Reim. By someone else from Earth.
“I guess it’s just the screen uh, drawing itself, Gazi. The iPhones were made for Humans. I can’t see a thing, but I’ve seen what you’re talking about on old televisions.”
“Hm. And it can do many things like take pictures, or even moving ones? Will you show me?”
“Oh. Of course.”
