Two [Guards] walked out of the gates of Liscor and across the Floodplains, talking. Arguing, bickering sometimes, but just walking.
Off-duty. One had a spear over his shoulders, the other walked with twin swords at his waist.
One was Antinium, the other a Drake. They were headed towards a building.
An inn, on a hill.
That was how it always had been. For a year. Exactly one year, they had walked like this. Sometimes it had been one or the other. Or one hadn’t gone. Or…
But this was how it started.
It was not the same. They didn’t have as far to go anymore, and they were changed. One greatly; he was a [Watch Sergeant] now.
…The circumstances were different, too. Both kept looking towards the inn.
“Dark. It always used to look like that in that village, remember? A ghost inn, staying up when the rest fell to pieces. You always did say someone might squat there. [Bandits].”
“Superior construction to the other buildings. Perhaps the old [Innkeeper] had a Skill.”
“Yeah. Now…”
The windows were dark. Glass, dimly reflecting the sunlight. It wasn’t evening. The time was off. It should have been evening, and the fading sunlight turning the Floodplains to an ocean of orange and red.
But it wasn’t. Nor was there any light merrily shining from within. A telltale smokestack…
“Like the old days. She thought I was a Dragon, remember?”
“I believe you told me that over a hundred times that week, yes.”
“And she had those blue fruits. Dead gods, I asked about them when we got back to town and some people sold them, but everyone warned me about the poison.”
“Yes. They did.”
The Drake fell silent, because his companion gave him so little to work with. As if he didn’t care…until the Antinium spoke.
“Acid flies.”
“Hm? Oh, right. Her catching them and you eating them.”
“Such innovation. And I recall the high-grade Potion of Cleansing Wounds…”
“Yep. All on her hand. Good call, though. If it wasn’t high-grade, you’d have blasted her hand off. Wow, the hand-cut from the fish. I almost forgot.”
“Yes.”
Their footsteps slowed as they looked up the hill. The inn was dark. After a moment, Relc spoke.
“…Maybe she’ll be in there when we open that door. She’ll say something like, ‘I saw a Dragon!’.”
“That sounds quite like her. She will not be.”
“You don’t know that.”
Klbkch opened his mandibles. He looked at Relc, then slowly nodded.
“I do not. There is a chance, however small. A chance so minute, so incomprehensible, you would have to be a fool beyond saving to believe it—”
“Yeah, just watch it, Klbkch. I can still punch you one.”
The Antinium saw Relc raise a threatening fist. Klbkch looked up at the windows. He went on after a moment.
“…a chance so minute it cannot happen. But if there were a chance.”
“Yeah. Do you want to…?”
For an answer, Klbkch began walking up the hill. Slowly. So slowly. Relc followed him after a moment. They didn’t speak for the first few steps, then Klbkch did.
“Hectval is at war with Liscor. I did not realize.”
“Hm? Yeah. We sent the army out. The new army, I mean. Embria’s there.”
“Your daughter. Yes. Are you worried?”
“She’s alive. I’ll ask more later. What about you? I heard we sent Antinium to the front.”
Klbkch hesitated. He touched his swords.
“I could make a difference. However, if I enter the war, it will escalate.”
“Yeah. Do you know what’s happening, though?”
The Antinium nodded.
“Of course. What do you wish to know? The shape of the war? The military gains? The losses?”
“…Just how it is.”
Klbkch thought about the question. When he answered, it was simply.
“It is how you have always talked about Liscor’s wars to me.”
