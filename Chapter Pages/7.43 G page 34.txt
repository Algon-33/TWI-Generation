“No. Apparently he stayed around and attacked them.”
“Thought so.”
Numbtongue imagined it. Nolocks, a [Skulker]—perhaps with Skills—but unarmed. Versus a Named Team. But he’d chosen that. He could have run; he might have escaped.
They had had a choice when they escaped the cages. Numbtongue understood that. That was why he’d given Nolocks the same choice.
“Did—what—”
Erin fell silent. She sat there, looking at the [Bard]. He stared at the ceiling.
“Did you agree with what he did? Did you understand…what did he say?”
The [Bard] thought about this.
“He was a Goblin. Not like me. Just a kind of Goblin.”
“Right. I’m sorry.”
Erin hugged him. She sniffed, as if she had done something wrong or if there was anything she could have done that she hadn’t. The [Bard] hesitated. Then hugged her back and sat there for a while.

Goblins. Goblins here, Goblins there. Goblins everywhere. And the same stories continued. Despite triumph—that. This.
Numbtongue left the inn and sat on a hill a bit away from the inn. A hill covered with flowers. There were graves here.
A few proper ones. There had been nothing to bury for the others. But there were two more tentative graves. Perhaps their owners didn’t need them yet, but it made Numbtongue almost smile.
A Goblin making a grave so they could rest just in case they died where no one could bury them. Badarrow and Rabbiteater would approve that.
But Reiss, Headscratcher, Eater of Spears, Pyrite…so many lay here. Not enough. Numbtongue thought about the two other Redfangs.
“Do you want to find them?”
Reiss stood over him. The Goblin Lord waited. Numbtongue looked up at him.
“I hate you. Because of you—all this happened.”
He pointed at the markers. Reiss nodded.
“But you need me. Without me—you cannot stop them. I am stronger than you. Until I am not—use me! What Redfang has ever turned down a blade?”
That was true. Numbtongue found a little bit of dirt and threw it through Reiss.
He realized he was lonely. He had not liked Nolocks. But it reminded him that there were no Cave Goblins. He was alone, for all he made some friends. And Reiss knew that. He pointed south.
“Do you want to know where they are? The nearest Goblin tribe south of Liscor is within reach of your door. They live hidden, in peace.”
He knew. Numbtongue knew there was no reason except his dislike of Reiss to stop him. He looked at the two graves.
If he was strong, he’d dare to find them. That was…part of the reason he kept mining higher and higher. Maybe if he went high enough, he’d find a trace. A clue. A hint.
“Rabbiteater. Badarrow. Maybe…”
“I can see the living. I can walk the High Passes better than you or Pyrite. Take my hand.”
The Goblin Lord urged him. The [Bard] was alone. Pyrite…he wondered if he leveled up, maybe. Perhaps.
“Take. My. Hand.”
The ghost reached for him. Numbtongue hesitated.
“No. Take mine.”
Numbtongue heard another voice. Reiss recoiled. The [Bard] spun. And he saw…
A Goblin. He sat there, cross-legged. Patiently staring at Reiss. At Numbtongue. A Hob—he grinned at his friend and then looked at his side.
“Nice sword. Can I see it?”
The [Bard] stared with wide eyes. He slowly reached out. Disbelieving. But…his friend extended a clawed-hand for Numbtongue.
He reached out and took Shorthilt’s hand. Reiss heard Numbtongue laugh. The Goblin Lord shook his head.
