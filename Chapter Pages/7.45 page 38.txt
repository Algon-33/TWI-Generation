“If she’s that sick…she must have a stronger reaction because she was cured. You all have an immunity. That was why you survived. And that’s why she kept throwing up! Colfa! We need to make Fierre vomit! Give her as much pure water as you can and get her to spit it up! We need to flush her system! And—charcoal! Burned charcoal!”
That was a way to remove poison, wasn’t it? Activated charcoal! Ryoka thought.
“Can Vampires get sick from eating charcoal?”
“I doubt it. We can drink most poisons. Just not silver.”
Bamer shook his head. Ryoka nodded.
“Then feed Fierre burned charcoal! Lots of it! If it can’t kill her—”
Magical immune systems. If it couldn’t kill Fierre, Ryoka would shovel a detoxifying agent down her throat! Himilt and Colfa took Fierre into the bathroom to wash her and try to purge her system. It was a disgusting process. Ryoka heard Fierre retching…the young woman helped Bamer boil more water. She raced about as Salamani ran back with distilled water and was sent on a useless errand—he was a distraction.
It worked. That was all there was to it. Fierre had ingested silver, washed herself with it, but Ryoka’s desperate treatments worked. The Vampire flushed her system over the course of the next few hours. Ryoka knew it was working because she heard Fierre’s groggy voice as the girl regained consciousness.
“What happened?”
She was going to live. Ryoka collapsed with relief. That was all. She had…done it.
Fierre wouldn’t die today. Ryoka closed her eyes.
So. That was what Teriarch had known. He had known the Vampires were poisoned. And he had done nothing. How cruel. And how like the Dragon. He had given her a hint by accident, though. And Fierre would live. But her family…
“Ryoka. There’s a problem.”
The young woman started. She looked up.
Colfa’s dress was messy. But her daughter was alive. The Vampire mother looked relieved. Grateful, as she stared at the Human who had saved her daughter. Uncovered the truth. Just…concerned.
“What? What’s wrong?”
“Fierre’s well. But—she’s starved for blood. She threw up all the blood she drank. And all our stores—everything we have is tainted. We could go into Reizmelt and find a [Butcher]—but how do we know…?”
How did they know that the blood there wasn’t the product of animals fed on Reizmelt’s well water? Monster blood? Animal blood? Did they find a deer or something and hope it had never drunk from silver-tainted water?
Ryoka didn’t know. She bit her lip.
“Maybe cow’s blood? Find one that’s usually grazing near rivers, I guess. Or…oh.”
She looked up. Colfa looked down at Ryoka.
“Where were you born, Ryoka Griffin?”
Earth. And yes, Ryoka had lived on well water, water from Izril for the last year. But that wasn’t a lifetime of living here. If there was anyone…Ryoka Griffin saw the unspoken question.
“I…”
“Fierre is starving. We can stop her. But if you’re willing—she’ll go into a frenzy soon.”
For a moment, the City Runner hesitated. But what was the alternative? She had done all this for her friend.
“Take me to her.”

Fierre was alive. But she was restrained. By her father. He was keeping her pinned as she writhed. Not with pain—but hunger. Her eyes had turned red and she was biting.
“I’m hungry! Blood! Blood! Where’s Fluffles?”
That took the scary right out of her—well, a bit. Ryoka saw Fierre stare at Ryoka. She licked her lips.
“Fierre. Control yourself. Ryoka’s agreed to give you blood.”
“Human blood?”
