Hope you enjoy. Volume 2’s Audiobook is out today, along with the 10-page preview of the comic! If you’re so inclined, check it out and leave a review! I’ve attached the .mp4 trailer to the top of the page and I hope it does well.
But I’m most grateful for your continued enthusiasm. As always, I’ll leave you with some beautiful art! This time, amazing pixel-art by Zelanter! And Hamriepuff drawing a lesson between Cognita and Pisces with absolutely no consequences whatsoever.
Thanks for reading!
