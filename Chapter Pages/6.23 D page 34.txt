Her conscience gnawed at her. Gnawed and pricked. If she was wrong—but if she was right—Luan stared at her. Slowly, the [Rower] bent. He spoke quietly.
“Do you want to win?”
Umina paused. She looked up at him.
“Yes.”
With all her heart. The Human studied her eyes. Then he nodded.
“Then win. There’s honor in sports. But this sport is all about cheating. Or so it seems. So win. And have all your regrets afterwards. But win.”
And in his eyes flashed the same thirst for victory that boiled in Umina’s gut. The Lizardgirl took a step back. Then she nodded and fled. Back the way she’d come.
“Umina?”
Marian looked around as she finished counting her coin. The Centauress trotted around the apartment, looking for her friend. She turned to Luan.
“Where did Umina go? Did you see?”
The City Runner nodded.
“She has an idea and went to try it. She’s trying to win. In her way.”
He met Marian’s gaze. The Centauress was hurt. Then angry. She pawed the ground.
“Aren’t we all? Why can’t she—never mind. Come with us.”
She gestured to Venaz. The Minotaur was straightening, checking his armor. He turned.
“Forget Umina. Victory belongs with us. We’re going. And you’re coming with us.”
He nodded at Luan. The Human smiled.
“Of course.”

They came out of the apartment. Three of them, and at least two ready for a fight. Marian’s bow was drawn. Venaz strode forth wearing his armor. Luan had a table leg.
Why was he there? Moral support. To make up for Umina’s absence. A good luck charm.
“An extra body to take a block for my back.”
“You’re all heart.”
“You’re being paid. And soon, so will the other soldiers. Let’s find a patrol.”
“Can’t we just head straight towards the plaza?”
Marian looked at Venaz. The Minotaur shook his head.
“Too many of the Iron Vanguard. And what if we run into a larger group of the Forgotten Wing company?”
“Oh. Right. We can’t bribe them all.”
“Exactly. We should—”
Venaz broke off. He turned his head, held up a hand. Wil and Marian froze. The Minotaur paused.
“There’s a large force coming up the north. Riders.”
“Wil’s group?”
“They might take us out. The other way, then. Towards the plaza—”
The three began hurrying down the street. They hadn’t gone more than twenty paces when Venaz halted again. He hesitated. This time Luan and Marian had heard it too.
“That’s a lot of footsteps.”
“Back to the apartment!”
They raced backwards. Too slow. Too late. The first [Mage] appeared on the rooftops. Five more appeared and began throwing spells. The first raised her hands and shouted.
“Wistram, Wistram!”
The other five stopped. On the far end of the street, a group of Dullahans floated over the rooftops. They saw the three Human [Mages] and two half-Elves and began throwing spells at once. The Wistram [Mage] fled, shouting. Venaz groaned.
“They’ve spotted us. The apartment’s no good! Form up!”
He put his back to the wall. Marian did likewise. And there they came.
An entire army of Humans. A regiment plus of Dullahans. And Luan, Marian, and Venaz were caught right between them. Both sides spotted the students and Luan; the Dullahans pointed.
“Take them!”
“Venaz—”
Marian’s head swung left to right. The Minotaur was rummaging in his bag of holding.
“One second. It’s time to pull out my last resort. I can’t use this. No, not this one either. No. No. Damn. Why did I have to have such impeccable selection?”
“Venaz! Hurry up!”
