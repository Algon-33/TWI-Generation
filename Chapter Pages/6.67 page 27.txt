It was so unexpected that Mrsha began to cry as well.
“Jelaqua?”
Erin looked over uncertainly. Jelaqua was sobbing, and something was running from her nose and eyes. Not tears. She tried to speak, hiccupped, tried again.
“It—it’s not fair! It’s not fair!”
Seborn stared at Jelaqua, too taken aback for words. The Selphid turned her leaking, sobbing face to him.
“I just—I don’t want to go! I like him! He’s the first person I’ve found that I like. Why can’t I stay? It’s not fair!”
Moore and Seborn looked at each other. The half-Giant raised a hand and patted Jelaqua on the shoulder.
“There, there, Jelaqua. Seborn was being angry.”
“You damn traitor—”
“There’s the door, Jelaqua. We can work around Invrisil. You don’t have to avoid Maughin. It’s just—”
“I know! But I don’t want to quit the team, guys! I don’t want to—but I know we’ll have to leave! If we take a big mission we’ll be gone for months! And I can’t ask him—I just wanted to stay for a bit longer. But then the Crelers got you and Seborn and I nearly lost my guys—”
Jelaqua’s outpouring of liquid was rapidly stopping. The Selphid sniffed something up her nose and Ceria had to look away. She was making wet, bubbling sounds as she spoke.
“I—I’m sorry. I know, Seborn. I know. I wasn’t there for the fight, or the Crelers—we can take Ulinde. We can try. I just need to talk to Maughin. But it’s so—”
She began to hiccup. Loudly. Moore was staring at Jelaqua, helplessly. And enviously. Seborn looked up at the sky, around at the staring people. He glared and everyone looked away. At last, the [Rogue] growled.
“Fine. Shut up. We’ll do it.”
“Huh?”
Moore and Jelaqua both looked at him. The [Rogue] looked like he was spitting nails. He nodded at Jelaqua.
“We’ll work in the south. Take jobs around Pallass. They have work anywhere we go.”
“What? Seborn—”
Jelaqua’s eyes widened. The [Rogue] lifted a finger.
“If you sail off on us when we’re working, I will quit. But we’ll take jobs, work from Pallass. We did it once. On two conditions. We’re getting steady work, not taking breaks for your little holidays. And second, we recruit. We try Ulinde out. And we find more teammates and—”
“Seborn!”
Jelaqua tackled him. The [Rogue] vanished with an oath before she could hit the stretcher where he was lying. Jelaqua grabbed him as he reappeared to the left, hugging and kissing him.
“I love you! Thank you, thank you, thank you—”
“Let go of me you damn idiot!”
Moore was beaming and smiling as he tried to hug the [Rogue]. Seborn drew his dagger and both he and Jelaqua let go. Ulinde stared at the three Gold-rank adventurers.
“D-does that mean…?”
“She’s not getting a full share of the bounty.”
Moore poked Seborn affectionately.
“Shut up. That’s right, Ulinde. You’re a member of the Halfseekers. We’ll try you out and—”
Ulinde’s screech made even the baseball players look up. She threw up her arms.
“I did it! Palt! Montressa! Beza! Did you hear? I’m a Halfseeker!”
“Oh.”
Montressa smiled, but she ducked her head and her shoulders sagged. This was how it ended. This was how it began. As Ulinde rushed over, Erin got up.
“Congratulations. Jelaqua?”
The Selphid was smiling fit to burst. Seborn looked irate, but Moore was smiling too.
“I guess we’ll see you on Pallass’ side, Erin. We don’t want to tax your door. But we’ll be around.”
“That’s good. But—who’ll take the door to Invrisil?”
Erin looked at the Halfseekers. Seborn paused.
“Right. We left the door.”
“We could always finish delivering it. It’s not too far.”
