The [Scourers] beamed as one, treating Umina like she was a minor celebrity. Which she…was? Luan eyed Umina as he sluiced himself off with more water. Venaz was demanding soap.
“No problem! Pleasure to be of assistance! This game is so exciting! And we want you to win, of course! When I think that you were using this pit—whenever I clean it, I’ll think of you! And uh—”
She peered at Luan with a frown.
“Is he a student too? Not one of the Titan’s personal class, is he? I know all the names. Unless he’s a new addition?”
“No, no. I’m a City Runner. And I really should be going—”
Luan raised his hands hurriedly. He looked towards the doors.
“I’ll find you later, Venaz, yeah?”
“Yes. Wait in the city. I’ll be sure to get you your money.”
The Minotaur breathed in and out. Only now did Luan realize something had changed about him.
He was wearing armor. The metal gleamed as water ran down it. Umina turned and stared along with Marian and the other [Nightpeople]. Venaz gritted his teeth.
“What? I told you I came prepared for a fight. This is only part of my gear. I’m not hiding any longer. Ready to go?”
“Nearly. Just one question. You said you were a City Runner, Mister Luan?”
Marian dumped a bucket of water over her tail. Luan nodded.
“I go by water, though. I’m a [Rower].”
The Centauress frowned.
“Odd. How’d you get through the harbor, then? The Iron Vanguard had at least six warships sealing it off.”
Luan smiled faintly.
“Well, they didn’t manage to seal it off fast enough. I slipped through.”
Everyone looked at him. Marian blinked.
“You got past six warships? In…what? A dingy?”
“A scull.”
“A what?”
Venaz snorted, then turned his head and spat back into the privy. The [Nightpeople] looked disapproving at that.
“He’s the fastest City Runner on the water short of a Courier now. Why else do you think I hired him?”
“Huh. Then are you any good in a fight?”
Marian eyed Luan. The City Runner hesitated.
“Not much good. But I served in a suppression company once. Saw some fighting, but I’m mainly good at rowing. Very good, actually. Why?”
Umina was looking at her friend. Marian was thinking hard. At last she came to a decision and reached for a bag at her waist.
“Mind staying with us? I’ll pay you twenty gold coins and Venaz’ fee right now if you help us win this game.”
“Marian!”
Umina exclaimed as Luan’s eyes went wide. Venaz blinked at the gold Marian held out to the City Runner.
“You want to hire my Runner? Why?”
“An edge. Luan’s a City Runner and he’s free to hire, right? Why can’t we hire help? The other students have done it.”
“Still, twenty gold pieces? Is he worth—”
Luan glared at the Minotaur. He hesitated over the gold coins.
“I’m afraid that arrogant cow’s right, Miss…Marian. I’m not good off the water.”
Venaz choked and turned red. Marian smiled.
“Just for calling Venaz a cow, I’d hire you. You made it this far. One person could make all the difference. What about it? You won’t break more than bones and if you do, there’s healing potions at the ready. And I want to win. Umina?”
The Lizardgirl started.
“You sure, Marian? The gold—”
“—is mine to use. If we win, it’s worth it. What about it, Luan the City Runner? My [Headhunter] Skill says you’re more valuable than I think.”
The Centauress stared at Luan. He blinked at her. And then he looked at Venaz.
Victory. The man smiled wearily.
“Well, why not? I’m in it this far. I could use some money and a diversion.”
