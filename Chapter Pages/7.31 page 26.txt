“Guards! Hold them back! Clubs only! No blades!”
Beilmark snarled. The [Guards] had a chokepoint. But Erin and the [Mages] were on the streets.
They ran. Erin just stared for a second in horror as her plan backfired. The first rank of the mob came for her, reaching, cursing—
They smashed into a barrier in the air. Montressa raised her staff.
“That won’t hold them for long! Run!”
“Damn, damn—”
Beza grabbed Erin. The [Innkeeper] turned and ran. Palt was already pointing.
“Back to the inn!”
All three [Mages] ran. They had ten seconds before Montressa’s [Forcewall] failed and the crowd streamed after them. It could have blocked multiple [Fireballs], but the sea of people pounding on it was just as effective. Erin had dropped her lantern. She ran—but Gnolls and Drakes were in the crowd. Only Palt was faster than them.
“Dead gods—”
Montressa saw someone leaping at her. She raised her staff; a wall of stone knocked the Drake flat. The others just boiled around them. They had bows! Erin saw Beza stagger as something hit her. A brick!
“Stop! I said—”
“It’s not going to work. Get behind me.”
Palt turned. The three passed him. Erin turned.
“Palt!”
The Centaur stared at the mob. Slowly, he lit the black cigar. Black smoke rose from it. He inhaled so hard nearly half of it ashed in a moment. Then he exhaled.
“[Volcanic Smokescreen].”
Black smoke rushed forwards. The entire street was consumed in an instant. Erin heard panicked voices, screams as people collided. She slowed—Palt turned.
“Run!”
He galloped past her. Erin didn’t understand why at first. Then—she saw the first high-level member of the mob racing out of the smoke.
A furious Drake with a block of wood in one claw. She didn’t know his class until he tossed the log of wood. Then she realized.
He was a [Thrower]—
Montressa’s barrier blocked the block of wood before it hit Erin’s face. The piece of wood exploded. The sound was like a thunderclap. The Drake cursed, picked up a stone.
“[Stone Dart]. Run!”
Beza pointed. The stone bullet hit the Drake in the chest and he vanished into the cloud. But more people were coming out of the smoke.
This time all of them ran. They went for the door. Erin was gasping, clutching at her side and Beza was shouting for Montressa to run faster. The [Aegiscaster] gasped.
“[Haste]—”
She sped up. Erin ran for the open door. She saw Palt urging them through.
“Hurry! Get through! Get—”
His eyes widened. He pointed.
“[Air Sh—]”
The brick hit him in the chest. Erin saw the Centaur hit the ground. She turned around.
The mob was on them in a second. Someone yanked Erin off her feet. She punched a snarling face, heard Montressa shouting.
“Palt! [Five-Fold—]”
Her voice ended in a strangled noise as something hit her. Beza rose. Of them all, the Minotauress was fastest.
[Iron Skin]. [Haste]—she laid about her, knocking people off her feet. She grabbed Montressa and was covering Palt as he struggled to rise. Erin was surrounded. She felt someone yanking at her hair.
“Stop!”
She hit someone else. [Minotaur Punch]. Then Erin’s hand was on her kitchen knife.
A claw raked her down the side of her face. The [Innkeeper] felt the burning pain. She closed her eyes.
No, please no.
She drew the deadly blade. Erin felt the air grow hot. Then—the person holding her burst into flames.
She heard screams. The air turned to fire. Erin froze, blade ready to stab. She saw people stumbling back. Then she heard something else
“[Fast Fireball].”
