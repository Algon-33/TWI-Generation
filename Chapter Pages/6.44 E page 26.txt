Mavika. Ryoka. Wiskeria. The fae and the rising dead. Belavierr lingered on Ryoka for a moment, and then looked back at Wiskeria. And she hesitated for a second. And she looked so tired.
“My Daughter. There is little time. I must do battle. I am hunted. But I ask one question of you. Would you see me dead? Do you wish it?”
The question hurt Wiskeria. She clutched her hat, her tears running down her face.
“No, Mother. I don’t. I don’t—!”
Despite it all. Not like this. Let it not happen this way. Wiskeria shook. And then she saw Belavierr straighten. She smiled, and the great hat rose. The Stitch Witch looked past her daughter, towards her death. And she relaxed.
“That is well. Then go, my Daughter. I will escape this death as I have others. Go.”
“I can’t leave you—”
But the black horse was already riding towards her. Wiskeria felt her clothes tugging her towards it. Belavierr gestured, and Wiskeria flew. As gently as if she was a child, settling onto the horse’s back. She clutched at her hat, shouting.
“Mother! Let me stay!”
But she was already being carried away. Wiskeria wept as the tall figure disappeared. And then she rode past giants. Creations of old cloth. And she realized she hadn’t known her mother well. If she had her craft—Wiskeria wept.
And then Belavierr turned. To the young woman who had seen it all.
“Ryoka Griffin. Tell me of my daughter’s heart. Does she…know of my love for her now?”
“I think so.”
Ryoka looked into those ringed eyes. And she saw a mortal woman there. Just a flicker. Belavierr nodded. And Mavika stepped forwards. Her flock of crows and the single raven flew high overhead. The [Witch] regarded Belavierr. And the Stitch Witch looked at Mavika, questioningly. The Crow Witch spoke.
“You are being burnt away. That [Knight] has the means to burn your magic itself. All your protections and wards are useless before his fire. He will turn himself and you to ash. And they have marked you.”
“Yes.”
Belavierr sighed. Mavika paused.
“If you ask it, my flock and I will give you half a day to flee.”
The Stitch Witch wavered. She was tempted. But her eyes swung back to Ryoka. And they flickered.
“I have a thought. If I do flee, they will come after my daughter. Mavika, is that so?”
The Crow Witch paused.
“She is of our coven. She was of my coven. We would protect her. But she may be a hostage or be forced to flee herself. This [Emperor] is not here and this order of [Knights] is powerful.”
“I see.”
“Your answer, then?”
Belavierr’s head turned. She stared across the moving land. Past the undead that walked, the spirits screaming through the dark skies. Towards a young woman riding back towards her village. Still looking back at her. Belavierr sighed.
“For her, I would give it up. My magic. What I possess. Even life. But not my craft. But I would gladly face my death.”
Mavika looked up. And she nodded once.
“I see your true nature, Belavierr the Witch. May you meet fire with craft and stitch.”
She turned and disappeared, flying past the dark shapes. That left only Ryoka. She looked at Belavierr. And then fled. The Stitch Witch stood alone. And she kept watching her daughter, until she was out of sight.
Then Belavierr turned. She felt pain. She knew her death waited. But not yet. She called on her magic, summoning them to her aid. But it would not be enough. So she cast one last spell, whispering into the night.
