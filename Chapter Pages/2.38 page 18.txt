Erin turned and glared out the window as Lady Magnolia’s mansion disappeared in the distance. She had a small thought in her head.
Maybe…she was actually a good person. A rich [Lady] trying to save the world by herself.
Probably not. She was still a jerk. But the things she’d said—
Outside, the world began to blur as Erin sped away from Lady Magnolia’s house, and back home. Thoughts whirled around in Erin’s head, not least of which was that Magnolia had put enough food in the carriage to feed both her and Reynold for a week. But that wasn’t as important as what she’d learned.
So many things. War? The Antinium? Were they really the biggest threat? Could Magnolia be trusted?
Erin wanted so desperately to talk to Ryoka about it all. But without anyone to talk to—besides Reynold, and he really couldn’t help with this—Erin found herself drifting off. Her mind began looping, and only a few thoughts repeated themselves.
What had Magnolia said? Choose. Erin thought she had an answer, but war? She couldn’t even imagine—
What should she do?
 
Live alone.
Save the world.
Run away.
Ask for help.
Live in peace.
Fight for freedom.
Bring democracy.
Protect secrets.
Go back home.
Save the world.
Protect her friends.
Save the world.
Give up.
Save the world.
Save the world.
Save.
The.
World.
