We shall remain here until his Majesty, Emperor Laken, may meet with us. We have matters of importance to discuss. An offer. A bargain to be made. While we wait, we shall offer our services.”

Miss Califor and Nanette standing together. Eloise sighing and adjusting her hat filled with flowers. Alevica winked at Ryoka in the crowd.
And Wiskeria, holding the hat, looked around, lost, and then at her mother. Ryoka saw a familiar look on Wiskeria’s face too, though she had never met the [Witch] before. But she understood the look on the daughter’s face as she gazed up at her mother.
Belavierr paused as she gazed around. She seemed uncertain for a moment. And everyone waited for something else to leave her lips. She eventually nodded, awkwardly.
“…Good morning to you all.”
