Ryoka and Ivolethe, from another time. Ryoka, whom Mrsha had looked to as the only one who remembered, who had taken her to this inn.
Who had run away after Brunkr had died.
That Ryoka. And the little Gnoll probably still loved the sad, brilliant, wounded, guilty, triumphant Runner. Even if she was so angry at being left behind with no contact. Even if she understood her curse had driven Ryoka away.
These were the things Mrsha believed. If Ryoka had come in that door, Mrsha might have run to her and hugged her before anything else.
But this? This was Ryoka’s…gift. What she had decided she needed to send to The Wandering Inn. These seven…Humans.
Mrsha stared. And her little face slowly turned from incomprehension to—dislike. She looked at these people, eating her hamburger and being so stupid.
And she did not like them. Not. One. Bit. Imani was staring at Mrsha. The Gnoll glowered at her and Imani flinched. Then someone put her hand on Mrsha’s head.
“So. Cute.”
Galina tried to pet Mrsha. Instantly, the Gnoll punched the hand off her head. Erin saw Galina recoil.
“Ow!”
“Don’t pet Mrsha, please. She’s not a pet. She’s a Gnoll.”
“But she’s so—adorable! I didn’t mean to bother you! Mrsha, right? You’re so precious! Hello! Can you say ‘hi’?”
Galina bent over. And innocent as the question was—it was the wrong one to ask. She didn’t know. Ryoka had never told her about Mrsha. The Gnoll’s ears flattened and she backed away.
“Mrsha can’t speak. She’s a kid. Ryoka rescued her, but—”
Erin’s stomach felt upset. She didn’t know what Ryoka had intended. What was she supposed to do? Ryoka! She wanted to grab Ryoka, find her, and shake her. The others were just looking at Erin.
“If you’re willing to—give us a place to stay, and food, we won’t be a problem. We can help out. This is a great inn, Erin.”
Kevin looked around. His vague assurances were added to by the others. Erin nodded, helplessly.
“Yeah. I mean—definitely. You can stay here. I guess we can have you help?”
She looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] frowned. Was that her job? But then Erin looked to the stairs.
“Oh no.”
“There they are. I told you!”
Montressa and Beza were staring at the Earthers. Like hawks who’d sighted a bunch of baby rabbits who’d basted themselves in barbeque sauce. Erin sighed.
“Stay here. Don’t say anything about home. Got it? There are problems—Montressa! I need to speak to you!”
The [Innkeeper] ran for the stairs. Montressa jumped and backed up.
“Erin, listen—”
“Don’t you dare send anything! And you! How many times have I told you—”
Palt jumped as he came out of his room. He tried to hide the smoking spliff, but it was too late. Erin began to harangue.
Problems. Lyonette was split between serving guests and eying the Earthers. Erin would do her best, but what would they do? Really? She’d have to think about it.
For now—this was the inn. Hexel slithered to the door.
“Miss Lyon? A pleasure. Can we enter Liscor from here? I don’t see my [Bodyguards]. Quite a displeasure, but I suppose this Liscor’s Council isn’t that fast on the job. Before I find work, we’ll require it, Yemmi. Don’t worry.”
He reassured one of the Lizardfolk. Lyonette pointed him to the hallway. Then she saw Rose come up behind her.
“Excuse me, Miss Barmaid? Where’s the bathroom?”
“The—outside. The outhouses are over there.”
“Thanks.”
Lyonette stared after Rose. Yes, something indeed. But that was her world. Confusion, chaos—
And change. You got used to thinking on your feet, adapting. Even to—
