“Mistakes? That they do not obey is to be accepted? Tell me, Erin. What good is a weapon that doesn’t cut where it should?”
“But they’re not weapons.”
Where was Klbkch? Senior Guardsman…? Erin searched. But all that stared at her was the Slayer. A Revalantor.
Antinium.
“They were never designed to be people. I am a weapon. One that thinks and lives and changes as I must. But I was made for one purpose. And I will fulfill it, even if it means laboring for ten thousand years. Even if it means my oblivion. I despaired until I met you, Erin Solstice. You gave me hope. Solved the puzzle I had searched for. Salvation for my people.”
He paused. Shook his head.
“But what you gave me is not Antinium. They are—children. Rebellious children. And I do not need them. Keep them if you wish. But they will not return to the Hive. If they do, they die.”
“Klbkch. Please. What’s wrong with…? What happened to you?”
The Antinium looked at her. And he was…moving. Trembling, slightly. His voice shook with it. Something beyond rage, mere incandescent anger. Something deep in him that had kept him alive, even through death.
“What is unnecessary is destroyed in Antinium Hives. The Individuals are still being tested. Assessed.”
He leaned forwards. And his voice changed.
“anD tHEy aRE fAilInG.”
Erin stopped. Her hand crept towards her knife.
“Klbkch. Look at yourself. You’re becoming Aberration.”
She wanted him to see. The Antinium laughed again. That foreign laughter.
“You do not know us. This is not Aberration in True Antinium. ThIS iS raGe.”
He stood up. Erin looked at him. But the Antinium just walked past her, towards the door. He looked at her. And she sensed it. Sadness, despair. And a rage so fierce it terrified her. Directed not at her. At himself—and something beyond this inn.
“Thank you for hope. But there is nothing here for the Antinium. We must begin again. Tell them. Tell all of them. They have until I finish my night shift. And then there will be no Painted Antinium, no Individuals in the Hive. Warn them. No one can stop me. Not the Queen or anyone else. Not even you.”
She looked at his swords. The Antinium turned. And he walked out. A perfect Antinium. He was still going on patrol.
It was almost funny. Erin looked at him as he shut the door. He never looked back. She heard him going down the stairs. Erin felt water trickling down her cheeks. She buried her head in her arms. For a minute. Then she ran to find Pawn.

The Antinium fled. They ran through their secret tunnel, to evacuate the Hive. All of them, even Pawn, despite Lyonette pleading with him to stay.
“I must go. It is our home. If I do not come back—know that there is Heaven.”
He didn’t say ‘I love you’. He didn’t know to. He just held her hands and then ran. Lyonette wept. The inn was full of silence as Erin stood at the hidden trap door, which she’d always known about.
“Come back. Bring them all to the Garden. Hurry!”
She shouted after them. But she didn’t go. This was an Antinium matter. What could be done? Could Palt, Montressa, anyone stop Klbkch? Enter the Hive?
No. So Erin stood in her inn, wiping at her eyes, blaming herself for every mistake she’d made.
About a few minutes after that, Relc arrived. He strode into the inn.
“Hey, Erin! Have I got a thing to tell you about! Have you heard about…?”
