Crimshaw murmured. Erin shook her head.
“No. The exact opposite. Whatever I’ve done—this isn’t the kind of thing you owe me. I’d be in debt. I don’t have the right. And I have every right. I—am not asking you for a favor. I can’t repay that kind of favor. I will try. But I will never succeed.”

She pointed at the old [Lord] and his retainers. Her eyes were clear, now. And Lord Toldos almost flinched from the finger.
“Lord Toldos. I am calling you to arms.”
He hesitated. And he said—

“—You do not have that authority. Nor are we allies, Miss Solstice. We are not on friendly terms. Why should I risk my life for your cause?”
Grimalkin of Pallass looked at her, recalling how they had last parted. She met his gaze.
“It’s not about whether we like each other, Grimalkin. It’s because I need your help. And because when you need me, I will be there so long as I’m alive. And you are one of the few people who can help. And because…”

She looked around at them.
“…It is the right thing to do. And you are men who believe that right and wrong exist, aren’t you?”
She saw them chuckling. Laughing. She had them there, you had to admit it.

Chaldion’s eye gleamed.
“For someone you don’t even know?”
“For my friend. She’ll die. And I’m selfish. Just like her.”
Erin was crying again. She shook her head.
“It’s so easy for Ryoka. She might die, but it’s harder to ask people to fight for you. That’s the only thing I’ll ever say. Because I’m a monster. I was too cowardly to become a [General]. But I’ll ask again. Again—I don’t want my friends to die. But my guests, my inn, isn’t enough. I need—an army. So I am asking you.”
She raised her hand. Both she and Chaldion stared at it. Erin held her glowing, golden ring up. The [Grand Strategist]’s eyes widened.
“My ring is glowing. Do you know what it means?”
He inhaled once. How had he missed it?
“Yes. How did you get that? No—”
He looked at her.
“Who were you?”
Who were you before you came here? She only smiled. It was not who she was. It was who she became.

The same smile. The same person. It still brought her to tears. Selys rested her head on her friend’s shoulder.
“Why you? Why her? Why me? Why us, Erin? Every time?”
Selys’ eyes were filled with tears. Erin looked at her friend. She hugged Selys tight.
“Because we don’t run away. Stay safe.”
She walked through her door, changing the position of the stones. She asked them, each and every one.
After Chaldion, she returned to her room and took the ring off her finger. Erin regarded it, then put it on top of her dresser, in her room. So that was what it did. She didn’t need it for what came next.
Not this time.
The [Innkeeper] walked out of her inn. People were waiting. She saw Wailant storm through the door and looked past him. She nodded.
Olesm stood there, adjusting his armor. He nodded back.
“I’ll see you in a moment.”
“Erin…”
She walked through the door. To Invrisil.

Now, the [Innkeeper] heard the first explosion. She saw the [Guardsman] start.
“Watch Captain?”
“I—I should check that out, shouldn’t I? I’ll be right back, Miss Emme—”
He was no Zevara. He was one of Invrisil’s Watch Captains. Erin saw the Dwarf woman, who had been plying him with autographs and tickets and a bit of wine, glance up. Erin was sitting in the Watch Captain’s office. She nodded.
“It might be the Guild of Assassins. Better to leave it, right?”
The man hesitated. His look was guilty.
“Er…yes. Perhaps. My lads are brave, but—there’s that and death, right, Miss…Miss Solstice? Miss Emme?”
