The Giant roared. His arm was lowering despite his efforts. His second arm came up, but he was still unable to hold the [Innkeeper] up. Erin couldn’t even lift the blade! She kept staring at it.
It couldn’t be. But it was. Even a memory—
“The blade of kings. She can’t lift it!”
One of the six cried. They were…rotting…in the light. Erin couldn’t even tell which one. She gasped. The speaker was right. She gritted her teeth. However—!
“I can’t lift it. Okay. Hey! I need a [King] to pick up a sword!”
She heaved the blade over the edge of the Giant’s hands. He and she felt the weight lift at once and he stumbled backwards.
The blade some called Excalibur landed in the sands of the land of dead Chandrar. A blade fit for a King of Chivalry. Who could draw such a thing?
The ghosts of dead [Kings] stirred. A [Queen] of Nerrhavia’s Fallen folded her arms.
“Only [Kings]?”
The six looked up as an army of ghosts fought for the blade. Erin held the umbrella higher.
Kasigna called up to her, furious.
“You—you thief! You’re no hero! You’re just a thief and child.”
Erin waved back.
“Of course I’m not! I’m not a hero. I can’t fight you. But…”
She looked around and down at her chest. She bled. The crossbow bolts stood out in her chest. Erin reached for one and yanked it out, as Numbtongue had. She tossed it down.
“I want to live.”
That was all. The six began to flee the burning sunlight of a world they could not walk—yet. The sword borne by the mob of ghostly rulers. Erin spoke on.
“I want to hug my friends and tell them I’m sorry. That I’m back. I want to drink water. I want…”
She thought of Sserys and gulped.
“I want to be loved. I have so many regrets. And I want it all. I want my friends to be safe. I want to be safe myself. I want to see my family again. It’s not enough to have one of those things. If I can’t have any of it, I’ll fight for it. I’m selfish like that. And silly. I don’t know about you lot—”
She waved a trembling hand at the dead gods and the end of the afterlife. The rulers of Khelt. The [Witches].
Grand destiny.
Erin went on.
“I just know what I want. What I need to have.”
They screamed up at her, enraged, furious, no longer smiling. Burning, feeling pain, fleeing the sword and light. Their voices mingled, screaming at her in unison.
 
“You know what we are. Do you really think to pit yourself against us?”
“Are you the ilk from which they cut legends?”
“Do you hold the will to change fate?”
“Defy death?”
“Slay Gods?”
“Are you capable of challenging the world?”
 
For answer, she looked at them. Erin slowly transferred the umbrella to one hand and raised the other. She curled her fingers up and then waved a fist at them.
“I’m being me. I don’t know about all that. But don’t get in my way or I’ll hit you.”
They shrieked at the young woman who was no grand hero, no impressive foe.
Then they fled.

Later, when the sword vanished and the umbrella still shone from the Giant who was bemusedly holding someone who in turn held the umbrella up, casting light, keeping the dark things at bay, Erin prayed.
Chandrar was safe for now. Not forever, but for now. So, in this moment, she prayed.
Not to gods. She’d met them and they sucked. Erin prayed to the living as the dead, instead.
“Please. Please…everyone. My friends. My family.”
It was a simple prayer. Erin closed her eyes as she composed it.
 
I want to live. I can’t ask you to, but please, if you will…I want to live. 
But I want you to live even more.
Don’t die, please.
And let me see you again.
 
Erin Solstice rose. And then got to work.
