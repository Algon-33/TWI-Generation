Hscel never took his eyes away from Ksmvr’s face. Antinium features. Broken antennae. Adventurer still. He saw Ksmvr’s chitin, the huge, beige snout. The giant lolling tongue and yellow teeth.
“What the—”
Spitty spat right into Hscel’s face. The Gold-rank adventurer almost dodged it. He stumbled back. Ksmvr heard a sound.
“Mweh.”
Then Rémi Canada was grabbing him, towing him back with Sandi.
“Get back here!”
Hscel howled, but camel spit was in his eyes, and for some reason it burned. Probably because of the hot peppers Spitty ate. Ksmvr was alive. And yet—and yet—he saw Nsiia running towards him. Saw Vasraf turning a grim face to the distance as Scaied’s army cheered, hearing Femithain’s forces were imminent.
“What is it? Why do I keep failing? It’s so heavy.”
The [Paladin]’s sword. Nsiia stared at it. Ksmvr whispered.
“What is it?”
“You’re delirious. Potions! [Healers]! You will not fight Hscel again. Vasraf, we have to fall back. Where’s…”
The Empress of Beasts turned her head. Her lips moved, but Ksmvr was still whispering.
“Almost. Almost. What is it? [Her—]. What does it mean?”
[Hero]? But he wasn’t one. Nsiia bent down.
“—What was that?”
“My class. I can’t level up. I failed. [Brave Skirmisher].”
“What do you hear? Say it again.”
Ksmvr didn’t know. Only that it started with an ‘her’. But…Nsiia was looking down at him. It was all because he was substandard, didn’t you see?
“It’s too heavy. Too heavy.”
The Antinium complained. He stared at the sword. Nsiia reached for it. She lifted the blade, with Ksmvr’s hand.
“It’s…not.”
She looked down at the Antinium, mystified. What was he talking about? Swords were not heavy, contrary to what non-warriors believed. They were light. Even this longsword was perfectly balanced, a beautiful weapon designed for slashing and quick movements.
Ksmvr muttered.
“Not heavy then. What’s the word? It’s…cumbersome. It’s…”
Forceshield in one hand. Dagger, longsword, crossbows. These were the tools of an adventurer. He also had his belt, with his potions of healing and his bag of holding. All of which were necessary. Important gear.
But even a bag of holding weighed several pounds. Hscel had almost nothing. Ksmvr had on armor. He had…
Something was flickering in the back of his head. Nsiia looked at him. With a monarch’s knowledge. And a sudden—burning suspicion.
“That’s not a class, Ksmvr. That’s…how long have you been hearing it?”
“Since Level 30. I am wearing too much gear.”
“No. I don’t think so. You’re just not—”
Ksmvr dropped his Forceshield, began taking off his belt, his cape. Nsiia stepped back as he shed his modified chainmail armor.
“Ksmvr. What are you doing?”
“It’s heavy. It’s all so heavy. Captain Ceria told me to wear it. But capes make me slow in the air. The Forceshield is mine, but it isn’t necessary. Just evade or parry. These weapons are wrong.”
He was muttering, searching around on his hands and knees. Still dizzy from bloodloss. Ksmvr was going back in time. This…this wasn’t right. What had possessed him? An adventurer fought with all kinds of gear, though. But he hadn’t trained with any of the weapons here.
“What’s happening? Empress, I am preparing the retreat.”
“Ksmvr. I think he has a rare event occurring, Vasraf. But how—it doesn’t make sense with the Antinium. No wonder he doesn’t understand. Ksmvr, we have to leave.”
Ksmvr stared upwards.
“…There. That’s it. I need that to fight him. Everything else is too slow. Even this stupid sword.”
