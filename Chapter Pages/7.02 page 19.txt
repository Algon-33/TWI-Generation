He drew himself up, spreading his arms in another pose as his legs opened. Erin refused to lower her hand.
“You’re just a pervert.”
“Hey! Only by society’s standards. Anyways, it’s not sexual. I’ve met weird people who enjoy this. In a sexual way. Disgusting, right?”
“Stop talking to me.”
Erin had to turn away and lower her arm for a second. Something bounced off her back. She swung around with a growl.
“Stop throwing things!”
“Hey, I’m just trying to carry on a conversation.”
The pillow was back in place. The Drake grinned at Erin’s expression. Grudgingly, she folded her arms.
“You’re not going to leave me alone, are you?”
“Nope. It’s rare the [Guards] throw anyone in the cell across from mine. Punishment cell? Now, that hurts my feelings a tiny bit. Anyways, what are you in for, Miss Human?”
He grinned at her. Erin realized she hadn’t gotten his name. She bit her lip.
“Erin. Erin Solstice. I’m in here because I…accidentally used a Skill.”
“Ooh. How many people died?”
The Drake eyed Erin. She glared.
“None! It was an accident!”
He grinned.
“Good. I’d hate to think I was standing across from a murderer. They have a few in here, you know. Nasty types. Good thing you’re stuck with me.”
“I’d rather be stuck across from a murderer.”
“No, you wouldn’t. They’re no fun. Well, do you have a class, Miss Erin? Can I call you Erin?”
“No. And I’m an [Innkeeper].”
The Drake’s gaze sharpened.
“Ah. So you’re the one with the magic door. I’ve been meaning to check it out, but I keep getting arrested. Pleased to meet you, Miss Erin! You know, I heard about you from some friends.”
“Really?”
“Yup. Xif. And Rufelt and Lasica. They keep talking you up and I saw the most fascinating flower Xif had bought from you. Well now, I am pleased to meet you. They call me Saliss, Miss Erin Solstice. Saliss Oliwing. [Alchemist] of Pallass, at your service. I’ll stop annoying you now.”
The Drake bowed slightly, and nearly dropped the pillow again. Erin stared at him.
Saliss?
The name rang a faint bell. But Erin couldn’t have said where she’d heard his name. She distinctly remembered Rufelt and Lasica talking about him, but for what? She tried to remember, and then frowned.
“Wait. You were doing that on purpose?”
Saliss winked at Erin as he held the pillow in place.
“Obviously. It’s fun to mess with people who haven’t met me before. But since you’re a friend of friends, I’ll stop. And I did think you’d committed an actual crime. The Watch really don’t put just anyone across from me. They must really hate your guts. Let’s start this over, shall we?”
Erin stared at Saliss. Then she hunted for the pebble he’d thrown at her. He nimbly dodged it as she hurled it back at him. He was quick! Even with her [Unerring Throw], she couldn’t nail him.
“Hey! I apologize, but you really should have introduced yourself sooner!”
“To a nudist throwing rocks at me?”
Saliss sighed.
“Everyone holds that against me. You know, Gnolls kids run about naked. And all they’ve got is fur! What’s wrong with scales?”
Erin pointed. The pillow was thankfully still in place. Saliss looked offended.
“What, that? Gnolls have them too! The male ones, at any rate. Don’t be vulgar.”
“You’re the naked one!”
Erin shouted back. Their argument had woken some of the inmates in the cells a ways away. Erin heard a chorus of voices and several insults.
“Shut up over there! I’m trying to sleep!”
“Ancestors. Who’s shouting?”
“It’s that freak. Turn around!”
