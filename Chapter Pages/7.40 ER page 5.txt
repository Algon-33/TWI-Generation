The [Witch Teacher] winced. Agratha was not one of the most powerful [Witches] who had come to Riverfarm to make a deal with the [Emperor]. But her coven was large, and she herself had come with nearly a dozen [Witches]. The first wave of them to make good on the [Emperor]’s bargain.
They had cornered the market on occult charms and magic in general. Moreover, even if they didn’t sell something, they came because they were protected from harm by the [Emperor]’s laws. A [Witch] would be punished for committing a crime—not for existing.
“Oh, a spill. The honey! I see, I see. A little sweeping spell should do it. Come on apprentices, this is a good test for you. Stand back, please.”
A few younger [Witches] joined Agratha. Laken listened and ‘watched’ as Hedag, Agratha, and four other [Witches] grabbed brooms. Hedag had to borrow one. They walked over and swept the honey back up into the overturned vats.
It wasn’t easy. The [Witches] grumbled and cursed and two had to borrow mops. Moving honey was hard work! The street was dusty, the honey didn’t want to move—but Agratha and Hedag marshaled the younger witches and eventually got it into the jar. Hedag yanked it upright, slapped a lid on it.
“There. Done as done! We wouldn’t mind a bit of that ourselves, your Majesty. Fair share for fair work!”
She winked, although Laken couldn’t see it. But Hedag had a wink in her voice.
“Your Majesty! That’s not fit to eat! It’s got too much grit and—”
The [Beekeeper], Ezerre, protested loudly as Laken Godart walked over, ignoring the milk which the [Witches] hadn’t bothered to sweep up. He opened the lid and Ezerre gasped.
The honey sat in the large, clay pots, without a speck of dust or grit in it.
“But I saw—”
“I find that staring at [Witches] isn’t very helpful, Mistress Ezerre. Happily, it’s not a problem for me.”
Laken Godart’s voice was dry. The [Beekeeper] hesitated and then blushed at the laughter that ran around the square. The [Emperor] nodded to Hedag.
“A pot, for your troubles, Witch Hedag, Witch Agratha. It is much appreciated.”
“Ah, what a fair ruler of men! Well, let’s have that honey. This pot. Agratha, I think we need biscuits.”
Hedag laughed again. The red-hatted [Teacher] bowed slightly to Laken.
“Thank you, your Majesty.”
The other [Witches] tipped their hats or copied Agratha. Hedag did not bow, but she touched the brim of her worn, brown hat. Laken Godart smiled.
Where would you be without [Witches]? Well, in much the same world, but perhaps a poorer, less interesting one. The unique spellcasters offered interesting solutions to problems. Wiskeria, for instance, had heard about the Creler-problem. She met Laken as he walked towards her—and the four individuals making their way into the town.
“Laken. I heard about the nest. If there are that many, we could try shaping the earth. We have enough [Witches].”
“To do what, bury the Crelers? I thought they were like cockroaches. Impossible to bury.”
The [Witch]-[General] shifted her hat. Wiskeria’s spectacles glinted in the light as she looked at Laken.
“They are. So let’s sink a cauldron. Poison the entire spot. It’ll kill everything there for three years—but better that than letting Crelers live.”
Laken grimaced. Wiskeria was good with poisons. However—he didn’t like that idea.
“Would it kill them?”
“No. Not Crelers. But it would kill a few, and weaken the rest. Your Majesty, if a hundred Crelers—even infants tunnel upwards, people will die. Even the Darksky Riders can’t handle so many swarming ones. The [Witches] will help but Crelers resist hexes.”
