“I don’t agree with Wiskeria. I don’t think you’re good or evil. And I think…its good you survived. I just wish Ser Raim didn’t die. And the [Hunters]…”
She paused. Embarrassed. Ashamed. But that was her thing. She liked immortals. Despite herself, she still liked Belavierr. Vampires, Dragons, the fae—there should be a place for them in this world. Even for the [Witch] who sat there.
“All you do is offer deals. And it’s the people who take them that suffer. There’s a justice in that.”
Belavierr half-smiled.
“I’m capable of offering poor deals, Ryoka Griffin. Of making threats. I sewed your lips together, as you recall.”
Ryoka ran a tongue over her lips.
“True. Do you do that often?”
“No. My craft demands I am fair. Things taken by force have less value. But my daughter does not lie when she calls me a monster. I think.”
“Right. But I can’t help…respecting what makes you not fit in my world. My best friend was like you, in a way.”
“Hmm. Strange. You are much like my daughter, Ryoka Griffin.”
“How so?”
Belavierr looked up. She shrugged.
“I do not understand you. Nor my daughter. I do not understand her. Despite losing my immortality. But I would rather she lived, especially now that she has found her purpose. I was…happy to learn of it.”
“What? Her craft? You mean, when she hit you with lightning? And she used justice against you? You liked that?”
Ryoka had her own opinion of that moment. And the idea of calling on collective will like that made her feel uneasy. It spoke to her of lynch mobs and public will. But she was hardly about to debate that with the tornado—Ryoka cast a quick glance ahead. It hadn’t moved? Or had it barely crept closer? What was going on?
Belavierr just smiled, though.
“Justice? Oh, that. Well, Wiskeria is free to make mistakes.”
“You think it’s not her craft.”
Ryoka blinked at her. The [Stitch Witch] nodded back the way Ryoka had come.
“Justice is a fickle, untrustworthy thing. It twists and bites and it is a harsh ruler. It can consume everything or ignore half-wrongs. It is a stupid choice for a [Witch]. But that is not what gives me joy, Ryoka Griffin. It is my daughter discovering she could take it.”
“I don’t follow.”
The Stitch Witch paused. She looked up and shook her head.
“When she took it from the villagers, she did what no [Witch] could. Not one of us. She became a new [Witch] in that moment. A [Witch] for the new era. One who can harness the power that belongs to law. The power of order and rules. That is Wiskeria’s true craft. It will make her strong. Perhaps—stronger than the old ways ever could. And most importantly—I know what drives her.”
Slowly, she tapped her chest.
“Me. Her hate for me let her find her craft. And it was what made her a [Witch]. And what stopped her from finding her path before now.”
“But that’s…”
Ryoka held her tongue. Belavierr glanced at her.
“What?”
“It’s so…isn’t it painful?”
The Stitch Witch paused. And for a second something like that flitted over her face. Then she just shook her head.
“Better that I am the source of her strength. Far better that I know it. I…have given her nothing. My daughter. From the day I found her and took her as my own, I tried to give her many things. I have given her food. Shelter. What I knew of as…love. But poorly. I know that now. And I have given her nothing since we parted. If I could—if she asked—I would give her what she desired.”
“What, exactly?”
Belavierr stretched her hands out.
