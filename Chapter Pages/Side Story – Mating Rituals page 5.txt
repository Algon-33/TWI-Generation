Side Story – Mating Rituals

Selys looked at Krshia, but the Gnoll looked blank. She sighed and tried to explain.
“Relc? Oh, he’s a soldier, Erin. He still is, even if he’s retired. He might be good for one night, but then he’ll be chasing someone else’s tail. Besides, he’s, you know…”
Selys’ tail lashed and she looked around before lowering her voice.
“Sort of ugly, you know?”
“He is?”
“Haven’t you seen his face? His jaw and the way the face looks just don’t match. And his scales…”
Selys glanced at her audience and realized she’d lost them.
“Well, trust me, he’s not a looker. Now, if you were talking about Olesm, I might see your point. He’s quite nice to look at.”
“He is? I mean, he is. So you’re saying…”
“Well, maybe. But there’s a lot of competition around him.”
“There is?”
Selys nodded seriously.
“He’s a [Tactician], smart, and he’s got good prospects for a better job in the future. A lot of people I know are interested in him.”
“Hrr. He is acceptable, I suppose. If Erin was interested in him. Is that the case?”
“I hadn’t thought about it. Ever.”
“Well, is there anyone you are interested in?”
Erin had to think. She only knew a few other males.
“Um, well, there’s Pawn.”
Both Gnoll and Drake stared at her. They exchanged knowing looks.
“Oh.”
“I see.”
“I didn’t mean that! I just meant he’s another guy. I’m not interested in him. At all.”
“That is good. I do not know anyone who would ever mate with an Antinium.”
“I’m not sure if they even have a way to have sex, to be honest. They seem pretty…smooth down there.”
“Right. And they’re bugs.”
“Yes.”
“Of course.”
“And I’m not into bugs.”
“Oh, I knew that.”
“Obviously.”
Erin narrowed her eyes at the other two. Selys cleared her throat.
“Well, who else is there?”
“…Pisces?”
“No!”
Krshia and Selys looked relieved.
“Well, if there is no one you know that you wish to mate with, it may be good to find one, yes? And we may help. We can tell you those who would be good at sex rather than those who are deficient.”
Selys nodded.
“I don’t want to judge, but that is pretty important. My friends all say it matters to how happy they are. I’ve heard some of their tail mates are—well, I don’t want to name names, but some of them hardly last any time at all.”
Krshia nodded, frowning seriously.
“I have had the same experience. Many night unsatisfied because he was unable to last. It is a frustrating thing.”
“Really? How long—or short is it for you, Krshia?”
The Gnoll considered the question.
“Hm. A short time would be…fifteen minutes? Good sex is usually half an hour or longer, yes? Usually closer to an hour, but there is not always enough time so…”
She glanced up and saw Erin and Selys staring at her.
“What? Much of the time takes place with the end, yes?”
“The end?”
“The knot.”
“The what?”
Erin thought she remembered hearing how dogs had sex. But if Gnolls—her eyes swiveled to Selys and the two shared a moment of shared interest and horror. Selys looked at Erin.
“Half an hour. Do humans…?”
“I don’t think so. Um. Probably not. The longest video I watched was—”
Erin tried to suck the words back out of the air, but then she realized her audience.
“…No. I think the average is around five minutes?”
“Five?”
“I mean, they can go longer. Why?”
“I usually—I mean, Drakes usually go for around ten minutes. At least.”
“Ten minutes. Wow. That’s pretty impressive.”
“It’s nice. I wish they spent more time afterwards, but you know males. Once they’re done, they’re done.”
“Mm. It is good to hold each other afterwards, yes?”
