Olesm spat. The [Commander] was lying on the ground, unmoving. Olesm looked behind him. Prisoners! Hectval had attacked Liscor’s army because they had to escort the damn prisoners of war! He was sure they were [Scrying] their captives.
It was so clever. So stupid. So—he raised a bloody boot and the others yanked him back.
“They’re monsters.”
One of the Hectval [Soldiers] said, looking shaken. He flinched as he saw a Drake aim a bow at him.
“Shut up. You don’t deserve to be made prisoners. You—do you even know what you’ve done?”
The Hectval Drakes looked at each other. They slowly shook their heads.
“You killed her! Your damn ambush squads! Erin Solstice! The [Innkeeper] of The Wandering Inn!”
Silence.
“Who?”
One of the Drakes just looked blank. Another snorted.
“A Human? One Human? You’re all…”
His tongue stopped wagging as he stared at the [Commander]. At the bows suddenly aimed at his chest.
“Hold your fire!”
Vell was shouting at the people with bows. Olesm was breathing hard.
“Enough! Enough.”
He looked at the surrendered prisoners. Shook his head.
“Put them with the others. Someone heal this—get him out of my sight!”
Some people dragged the [Commander] off. One of the [Healers] kicked him once, then dropped a potion on his chest.
“Olesm, this is going too far. There are rules of engagement—”
“I don’t recall signing a treaty, Captain Vell! Regroup! Regroup! Get Keldrass back here! Where’s Moore?”
“Still fighting. Strategist—”
Menolit looked at the Drake. Olesm stared ahead. His jaw worked. He looked at the prisoners, swore, and raised a claw.
“…Retreat.”
The [Veteran]’s eyes widened. He almost said ‘are you sure?’ But he didn’t want to change Olesm’s mind.
“What? We have them on the run!”
An angry Gnoll bellowed. Olesm swung around.
“We can’t keep doing this! The prisoners are slowing us down! Either we let them go—or execute them! Either way, we’re marching too slowly. Tell Moore to disengage once the enemy flees and get back here!”
Menolit was right. Grudgingly, Olesm turned his horse. Take the prisoners. Head back. Menolit murmured a silent ‘thank you’ as Olesm spoke into the speaking stone and word was relayed across the different groups.
Then came Bevussa.
“Olesm. Moore’s marching ahead.”
“What? I just told him to—”
“So is Umbral’s group! They’re out for blood! They’re going all the way to Hectval’s walls!”
“I gave them an order! We can’t take an entire city! Get them back here!”
Too late. Olesm heard distant fighting. And worse—he saw more elements of his army marching ahead. They had heard him.
They weren’t listening.
Blood. Blood for the [Innkeeper]. For revenge. Menolit looked at Olesm.
“Do we leave them? This is a bad idea, Olesm—”
The [Strategist] hesitated for a moment. Then he cursed and began shouting.
“We’ll catch them and drag them back if we have to! Form up and advance! Archers in the center! There!”
Onwards. Menolit’s warning lay forgotten as Olesm advanced. He caught up to Moore, the others, trying to turn them back.
But the [Strategist] realized—he had lost control. The fury in the other groups had not abated.
Hectval had not yet bled nearly enough. These—these were just skirmishes. The prisoners began to lag behind the furious advance of the main force.
Camouflaged [Scouts] identified Liscor’s advance. They noted number, composition, and location. Two more armies began to creep into position.

A terrible realization struck Lyonette. It was simple, compact, and she realized she had never had to do it before.
Tell friends. Tell family. Tell…anyone…that Erin Solstice was dead.
