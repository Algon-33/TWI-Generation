Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)

“I’ll be damned if I let them take our mark.”
Therrium swore. He looked up, sharply.
“Another ship’s closing with The Emerald Signet. Get me eyes on what’s happening. How many vessels are in the water?”
“Many, Captain. Some are in the sea.”
“What? Drowned Ships? Why aren’t they hailing us? Unless they fear to make sound or light?”
“I don’t know, Depth Captain.”

The first vessel passed close to The Emerald Signet. It was a small ship. Not close to the galleon-class that was The Emerald Signet.
“A caravel.”
Inky breathed as Captain Lasc peered through his sky glass. The students watched, cautiously. It was a small vessel to take on the galleon. And it didn’t seem to be. The sails were furled. But there were people on deck, staring up at the ship.
“Ahoy. Are you lost in the fog too? We sail the storms. If you be peaceful, raise the flag of truce.”
First Mate Delivan called out softly. His voice was the only sound in the waters. The figures on the boat stared. There were a good number of them. On the railings.
They made no move. But neither were they triggering anyone’s [Dangersense]. Yet. The two vessels drifted closer.
The waves were taking both vessels in the same direction, but the caravel was lighter and moving faster. It was chance that the two had met. And as the ships drew closer still, the fog parted enough for Wil to see something in the mists.
Red light. A strange, ominous glow in the darkness, multiplied many times. And then—amid the fog—he realized.
They were eyes.
Crimson eyes. The crew of The Emerald Signet recoiled as they saw Goblins.
They stood on their ship. Crudely built, but seaworthy. Goblins. Many of them were small, but Hobgoblins sat or stood along the side of the ship.
“Goblins.”
Venaz breathed. He reached for his axe, but Inky and half a dozen [Sailors] held him back.
“Not here! We’re too close to the Kraken’s Pass!”
“But they—let go of me!”
Someone slapped a hand over his mouth. The Goblins looked up. They stared at the Humans with curiosity. Without fear.
“Have you caused this?”
Lasc’s voice was wary. Cold. But the Goblin’s sails were furled. And—one of them moved. Wil saw a figure sitting on the deck. His hair was beaded. His skin tattooed. Feshi murmured.
“A [Shaman].”
She stared at the Goblin. Small. He was a regular-sized Goblin. But he was in charge in some way. He glanced at her. And then he grinned at Lasc. Slowly, he brought one finger to his mouth.
Shh.
And he mouthed one word.
Krakens.
Without a word, the caravel drifted past The Emerald Signet. The [Storm Captain] hesitated. Venaz was furious. He wanted to attack, or interrogate the Goblins. But they were all—wary. The Humans let the Goblins pass.
“I’ve seen Goblin crews only twice in my life. I heard they sailed the ocean. But even they fear Krakens.”
Inky murmured when the caravel was long out of sight. Captain Lasc was trying to figure out what was going on with Delivan and the students. Venaz stared through a port window.
“Of course they go to sea. They have an island.”
The others looked at him. But the Minotaur said nothing more. Lasc looked around.
“Yet—they were helpless as we were. The fog wasn’t caused by them. And if their [Shaman] couldn’t raise it—they control the weather. So. Something’s out here.”
The others nodded. They did not know what. But the watchfulness of all on board sharpened further.
It was another day before they found out what it was.

“Captain. Lord Kallinad. We have a signal in the mists.”
