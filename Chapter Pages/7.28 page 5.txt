She gave him a look. He dropped the bluster and looked embarrassed. Ryoka couldn’t help it. She laughed and Relc started laughing too. The secret of Relc was that he didn’t take himself that seriously.
The secret was that he was deeper than what you took him for. Like everyone else.
“I don’t regret it. Just so you know. And it was my decision, bad lines and all.”
Ryoka punched Relc in the shoulder. The Drake grinned.
“Hey, you know, once you use the best lines on the ladies, they can’t resist—”
He caught her expression.
“Sorry.”
“It’s alright. We’re adults. And this—is fine. We don’t need to defend it.”
Ryoka said it half for Erin, who turned red at the unspoken reprimand in the City Runner’s voice. And half for Mrsha. The little Gnoll probably should be scolded for her prank. She sat under a table, ready for one.
But the City Runner just scooped her up in a hug. She swung Mrsha back and forth.
“You little prankster. Don’t do it to anyone else, got it?”
She meant Pawn and Lyonette. Mrsha hesitated. Ryoka hugged her.
“It’s not a bad thing. It just means two people—like each other, Mrsha. I’d never stop loving you. You understand? I might be a bad person. But I’m not that bad.”
The little Gnoll looked up. And then she hugged Ryoka, fiercely. She sniffed. Perhaps more of her prank had been part of her emotions.
“Hey. It’s totally cool. You can hit me. I’m an idiot, Mrsha. Go ahead. Punch me. I can take it!”
Relc was alarmed by Mrsha’s sudden grief. He came over. Mrsha punched at him, weakly. But that wasn’t it.
“It’s not you, Relc. I…just have to go. I should have stayed with Mrsha. She knows I have to leave today.”
Ryoka felt guilty, now. She had focused on Relc, gone after him because she knew how he must have been feeling. But Mrsha clung to Ryoka.
“Does it have to be today?”
Erin spoke up. She looked a bit ashamed as well. Ryoka was glad—she hadn’t flared up at Erin. Not today. She met the [Innkeeper]’s eyes.
“I’m sure. I have to, Erin. There’s so much to do. I have to beg an audience with Magnolia—well, T—Eldavin is going to do that. But I need to find more. Two more, at least.”
“To bring back Ivolethe.”
“To meet her again.”
The young woman nodded. Erin hesitated. Bit her lip.
“But it’s just once. Why is it…?”
So important? Ryoka knew Erin had questions. Doubts. Of course she did. To meet Ivolethe one more time, Ryoka had to do the impossible. Create a party to summon the fae, invite three grand nobles of Izril.
Why was it worth it just to see her friend again? Perhaps—because she and Ivolethe were friends. Ryoka couldn’t explain it better any other way. She had so few friends. Erin, Ivolethe, Fierre, Lupp—maybe Alber, Relc, Ceria, Calruz and a few others counted.
But so few in this world. For any one of them, Ryoka would run through the Bloodfields in the summer. To save their lives? She’d risk her life. Ivolethe had died for her. Ryoka wanted to see her again. Not just because she missed her friend.
Ivolethe could teach her how to master the wind.
“I have to go, Mrsha. I do. And I’m not going alone. The Horns are going to pick up their gear, and then we’re going to head north. Together. For a bit.”
She’d run as soon as they left Invrisil. The Horns were too slow. But Mrsha didn’t have to know that. She hugged Ryoka tight.
“Griffon Hunt too. We’ll be on the road for an hour or two.”
The City Runner gently cradled Mrsha as she heard a snuffle. Erin looked misty-eyed too.
“I know they just got back. But—but—can’t you stay forever? I’ll feed you until you get fat and old. You can even sleep with Relc.”
