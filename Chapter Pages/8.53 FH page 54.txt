I’m done for a bit. I’m off to see family and that’s very important, especially in light of all that’s happened these last years. But I will be back by the 30th! I hope you enjoy this chapter, which has nothing at all to do with anything interesting, but sometimes we need the salad life.
Not that Ceria knows anything about that. I will be back, but in the meantime, consider listening to Book 5! Buy those presents for Christmas if you celebrate it, and hopefully we’ll have some more story soon! Big things await, the comic especially.
See you in a bit!
