“What are you doing, Olesm? Why are you suppressing your feelings? You are entitled to them. It is right to weep when terrible things happen. Men, women. Tears are natural. And so is rage. So is anger! Have you ever known me to hide my feelings?”
“No. Not you—”
He almost smiled. Her eyes fixed him. Maviola shook her head.
“Anyone. Olesm Swifttail, we all must feel emotion. Or else, what are we? Just shells of impartial thought? It is fine to weep. Fine to rage.”
“It terrifies me, though. What might I do? I hate them so much.”
The [Lady] shook her head. She looked past him, at Hectval’s army.
“Hate? Why do you say that as if it is such a wrong thing? Is there no one deserving of hate in this world? Did they not deserve it for what they did? We are no perfect people. Humans or Drakes. Hate them. Leave only room for your soul. But look at them, Olesm. What do you see?”
He looked. He saw an army from a foreign city. Who had started a war by killing someone he loved. Who had brought an army against his army. Who used surrender like a trick.
“Hectval.”
The [Strategist] felt it building in him. He looked back at her and realized. He had raged. And then feared for the people under his command.
…But that did nothing for the pain. Nothing for the fury, underlying it all.
Erin. He looked ahead. Hectval would never let them retreat. They would harry them back to Liscor, assail the city itself.
They thought this was a game of war. And the bodies were the score. Maviola El looked at Olesm.
“We’re still outnumbered. Flanked.”
“Oh, Olesm. You should have let the Earl join you. Or waited for me.”
The [Bannerlady]’s eyes glowed. She showed Olesm something she’d brought from Liscor.
A glowing mana stone. The [Lady] shook her head.
“I did not forget the supply line. Now—go.”
Olesm whirled. He felt the terrible rage building. This time—he didn’t try to suppress it. He raced through the ranks of bodies fighting the withdrawal.
“Turn! Turn around! 4th Company, to me! Timbor! Get me a door!”
“A what?”
The [Innkeeper] turned. Maviola tossed him the stone. She drew the Kaalblade. Olesm roared.
“For the Innkeeper of Liscor! Charge! For Liscor! To me! 4th Company to me!”
He stopped as the word went through the army. He pointed back at Timbor just once. The Drake spoke.
“Open that door. Summon the Black Tide.”
Then he plunged forwards. The army of Liscor followed, and Maviola El, holding a banner of fire aloft.

“What is he doing?”
[Strategists] watched. The Walled Cities were watching after Salazsar requested an immediate link to the battle. Had they heard him right?
“Did a [Strategist] of Liscor just summon—Pallass, confirm! We have to countermand—”
“Manus. Shut up.”
The Grand Strategist was watching. Liscor’s army surged across the ground, after the half-Giant and Menolit’s forces. The flanking forces were forgotten as they plunged towards Hectval’s army.
The Drakes had formed their famous defensive lines. But Liscor’s 4th Company was following the [Strategist] into the charge. And the [Bannerlady]—
She cut left as a roaring being of flame burst out of her horse’s flaming hoof prints. It dove at the enemy Drakes, burning them. Their weapons jabbed at it uselessly. Only a spell damaged the being of fire.

“The House of El!”
Maviola El cut left. Olesm was surging into the heart of the enemy army with 4th Company providing the tip of the spear. She supported him, using the flame elementals to burst past the lines of the Drakes.
