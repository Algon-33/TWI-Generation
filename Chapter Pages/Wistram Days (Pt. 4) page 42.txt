Silence. Illphres stared at Ceria, and then nodded.
“Interesting.”
That was all. She turned away and began to walk from her classroom. Ceria jumped as the ice blocking it reformed in an instant. She called out to Illphres in despair.
“Wait! Where are you going?”
The ice mage made no reply. She walked away, and Ceria sunk to her knees in the cold corridor.
That was it. It was over.
Slowly, Ceria made her way back to her room. She crawled into bed and slept, too full of sadness to cry. She slept as she heard students stumbling out of her door, slept and willed herself never to wake.
But someone did wake her. Someone hammered at her door and shouted when Ceria didn’t respond.
“Ceria! Ceria! Are you in there? Get up! You passed! You did it! You passed!”
“What?”
Ceria leapt out of bed. She shoved open the door and nearly ran Pisces over. He gabbled at her and then gave up and both of them ran down the corridors, past students celebrating and crying and hugging each other. They came to the entrance hall and stared up at the floating words that danced and spun about in the massive room.
It was a list. A list of names. Each one was a student. Ceria saw Pisces’ name on there, no last name given, and Charles de Trevalier’s, and Timon’s too. But she had no time for that. She looked up and down the list desperately, and then saw her name. It was right on the end, hovering in the air, slightly out of place, as if tacked on at the last minute.
Ceria Springwalker.
