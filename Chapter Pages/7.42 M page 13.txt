“However. If I let her die to treachery, to the true traitors of Izril, slain by cowardice, by [Assassins]? The day I allowed such a thing, that day, the House of Veltras is no more. We are the Five Families of Izril. Silent cowards have no right to slay us.”
His army was coming. Slower, far slower than the [Lord]. But they were coming. And—as the [Assassins] waited for orders, Ressa limped backwards towards Magnolia. She was kneeling.
“Reynold. Stay with me. Reynold.”
He looked up at her.
“I believe I’ve lost something, Lady Reinhart. Go on without me. I regret that I cannot drive.”
“Be silent. Ressa—”
“I have to fight with him. Stay in the carriage. Lock yourselves in—”
The [Maid] was coughing. The north watched. And then—Magnolia Reinhart’s eyes widened. She raised her head.
“T—”
She vanished. The [Assassins], Ressa—even Tyrion stared.
“But I had the teleportation spells locked! Even [Greater Teleport] should have been slowed by—”
The [Mage] cried out as the others whirled on her. Suddenly—their calm professionalism turned to uneasiness. Ressa looked around.
“No. Wait, w—”
She vanished. Reynold was grinning, coughing—he vanished too.
“What?”
Tyrion Veltras stared at where they had been. He didn’t comprehend what spell could have done that. Then he whirled.
“[Shockwave Punch]!”
The [Martial Artist] slammed into his shield. The [Lord]’s shield absorbed the entire blow. Yet—his horse grunted at the strain. Then—from the side, the [Thrower] screamed.
“[Complete Onslaught]!”
He unloaded everything. Tyrion whirled—too slow—the [Mage] fired into the cloud.
“[True Lightning]! [Siege Fireball]! Damn you! You—”
The [Lord] galloped out of the haze. His warhorse stumbled. He saw the wire too late—the invisible edge caught the horse. It didn’t go through the enchanted armor, but it blocked his retreat.
The [Blademaster] was standing there, still with a hole in his stomach. The whites of his eyes were showing. But he spoke.
“[Walk Forwards Unto Death, Or Victory].”
He advanced, his sword swinging and tracing patterns in the air. Tyrion Veltras touched his mount once.
“I’m sorry.”
The warhorse went down. The [Lord] threw himself to safety. He rose, blocking a spell and dart. Suddenly—the [Assassins] had turned their fury and shock on him. He met the Minotauress and blocked her punch.
“Do we kill him or not? We can bring the [Lord] down.”
Sithorn was speaking into the stone. The [Lord] rammed his shield into Mire’s chest.
[Retribution of the Shield]. The stored energy sent the Minotauress flying so far she landed in a forest. She might be dead. The [Lord] pivoted.
“[Thirty-foot Slash].”
The [Trapmaster] ducked with an oath. The [Blademaster] parried the incredibly long and wide strike. Tyrion raised his blade.
“[Might of Four].”
He brought his sword down as the throwing expert lunged at him and drove the other man into the ground.
…But he was a [Lord]. And a [Lord] alone was weaker. The [Assassins] got back up. Mire howled. She had transformed into a larger, hulking figure. Her arm was still gone, but the rest of her injuries…
They were Faces. The [Lord]’s eyes widened fractionally. He was used to battlefields. He had never conceived of five opponents like this. The [Assassins] advanced.
“Bring him down. [Wire Noose].”
The [Trapmaster] snagged an arm. He tossed the wire to Mire and she grabbed it with her left arm and screamed in fury. Tyrion tried to plant himself; with her enhanced strength she threw him into the air. And a spell.
“[Siege Fireball]!”
