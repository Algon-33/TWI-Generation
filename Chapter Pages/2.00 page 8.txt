Ryoka said it reluctantly, but it had to be said. Erin glanced up from her table and the pile of dirty dishes and glanced outside. It was night. Midnight or later, and the sky was as close to pitch-black as it ever came.
“What? Why? I can make up a bed for you. I’ve got a bunch of—well, every room upstairs is open. And it wouldn’t cost too much. If you want—”
“No.”
The other girl said it flatly, and then tried to modulate her tone.
“No. I’m sorry. Thank you, but there’s something I have to do.”
“In the middle of the night?”
“I need to start running. I’ve got something that can’t wait and it’ll take me a day and a half to get where I’m going.”
Erin’s face fell. And she’d been getting on so well with Ryoka, too.
“If you’re sure. But it’s a long road and you look tired. What would one night matter?”
Ryoka wavered, clearly torn. But eventually she shook her head.
“I’ve got to—I need to go back. North. To Celum. There’s someone…someone I have to talk to. Something I have to do, now.”
“If you’re sure…”
“I’m sure. Sorry.”
Erin sighed. But she put a smile back on her face.
“Well, okay. But if you ever want a meal or if you’re in the area—”
Ryoka paused, and then she smiled awkwardly.
“I’ll be back. But I have to go now.”
She pulled something out of her pocket and glanced at it.
“Huh. Good enough for a few hours.”
Erin blinked as two red ear buds appeared and Ryoka popped them into her ears. She raised her voice as Ryoka turned.
“Oh, hey. Is that an iPhone?”
“Mm.”
Ryoka flicked through a few screens on her phone and then froze. Erin continued on, oblivious.
“I’m not an iPhone person. I got an Android – well, my parents got it for me. I wouldn’t have minded an iPhone—I just use it to play chess and call friends, mostly. But—”
The other girl was staring at her. Erin broke off awkwardly.
“What? Is it something on my face?”
Then she stopped. Erin’s eyes widened as her ears caught up to what her mouth was saying. She stared at Ryoka.
“Oh my god.”
