A cup running over with water. A sun and four moons.
A blade of grass.
Pawn stared at it all. Each Soldier was there, on the wall. Their bodies were gone, but there they were. He ran his hands along the dried paint, and felt something there.
Small things. Shapes and symbols, things that held meaning only the Soldier that had chosen them would know. Fragments of their soul.
It was not enough. It could never be enough. But it was something. It was something to cling to. Pawn looked at the Soldiers, covered in paint, in blood. He knelt as they clustered around him, putting awkward hands on him. Pawn could not look at them. He whispered the words.
“I am so sorry.”
They said nothing. But they held him, clumsy killers, people with no voices who wore their souls on their chests for all to see. Pawn looked at them and wept. His eyes shed not a tear. They were his. His Soldiers. His guardians. His friends.
His people.
He embraced them. Pawn wept again, without tears. Then he went to see Erin.
