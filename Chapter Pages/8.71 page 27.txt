It’s about quality. In a regular chapter, I’d just continue tomorrow, but I am writing another chapter tomorrow.
So here it has to end. I could push, but I’ll lose my energy for the week and the ending will be rushed.
I’m now behind my schedule. But we’ll see if I catch up tomorrow or what. Anyways, each chapter has ended with a cliffhanger…but I am now getting to the cliff, then jumping off.
The Wind Runner is on the move once more. Did you enjoy it? Let me know and just wait. I have four more days to see how far I get.
Thanks for reading.
