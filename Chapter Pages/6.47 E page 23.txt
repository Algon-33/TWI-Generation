“He was never perfect. Believe me, if I thought I could break away from Lord Tyrion’s army, I would have. I saved the few Goblins I could, Ryoka. And I left my people alone for too long. I need to regain their trust. Durene’s…everyone’s…”
He sagged in his chair. And Ryoka felt like he’d had enough. She reached out and touched his hand.
“You’ve got a bit of mine. And I saw what you did. Riverfarm needs you. I hope you’re good for it.”
Laken nodded, and straightened a bit.
“Me too. As you for you—I meant what I said, Ryoka. I owe you. You kept Riverfarm from being destroyed. I know it wasn’t easy. But you did it, even though you didn’t owe me anything. Thank you for that.”
“You could start by paying me.”
Laken chuckled. Ryoka didn’t.
“I’m serious. I have expenses.”
“I know. I’ll get the money to you. I’m not hurting for coin. Call it my first Skill or just luck; Gralton, one of my new allies, is one of the richer [Lords] in the area. And Yitton Byres has his silver mines, although he’s not hugely wealthy. I can borrow from them until I get Riverfarm an actual economy. That’s actually easier than the Goblins, by the way.”
“Really? In that case, a thousand gold coins—”
“Don’t be greedy.”
“I outran a tornado made of fire to save your damn village. And the [Witches]—”
The two fell silent again. Ryoka scrubbed at her face.
“You never met her. But Miss Califor was a hero, Laken. You owe them. I don’t know exactly what they’ll ask, but you owe them something large. As large as a life.”
“I know. Tell me just one thing, Ryoka. What was the other one like. Belavierr?”
Ryoka paused. She took a long, long time to reply.
“Like…a nightmare, Laken. A nightmare, at first. But a classic one. One you think you know. So it’s scary, but you expect it, in a way. Horrifying as it may be. And then you wake up. And you think it was just a dream. You think you know reality. But then you realize you’re still dreaming. That’s her.”
Laken shuddered. The two sat in silence for a while longer. At last, he cleared his throat.
“I don’t expect you to stay. I’d like you to. If you wanted it, I could find you a role in Riverfarm. For you and your friends. But I doubt you trust me that much.”
“Nope. And I’m a Runner. Born to run.”
Laken smiled.
“Will you keep in touch?”
“You bet I’ll check in now and again.”
Ryoka nodded. She stood up, and after a moment, hesitated.
“The traitor. The one who ordered the attack on the Goblins at Lancrel. I told you about my suspicions, didn’t I?”
Laken paused. Ryoka had, by [Message]. He spoke slowly.
“Tyrion Veltras was as good as his word back then. He asked every single noble under truth spell if they had committed the crime. His subordinate, Jericha, did it. And the traitor never showed up.”
“You can fool a [Detect Truth] spell. Not just with the wording. You can literally just ignore it if you have the right artifact. Or spell.”
Ryoka watched Laken’s expression. He swore under his breath.
“Alright. Who’s your guess?”
She told him and watched his face change. Laken got up to pace. Ryoka quietly spread her arms.
“It’s only a guess.”
Laken nodded, distractedly, but she saw how rattled he was.
“In storytelling logic, your first guess is always wrong. And it’s always the last person you expect. Like Durene, I suppose. Or Frostwing”
“If we were in a story. How many of them have Goblins that aren’t monsters?”
Laken paused at that. Then he sat back down.
“I’ll check it out. Even if you’re right, finding proof will be hard. Especially because everyone knows about my [Emperor] senses. Still. Lady Rie?”
“Yup.”
