She peered around. Todi was running, with his team. Belavierr lifted a finger and the adventurers flew. Revi saw the distant shapes soaring up, ten feet. And then they smacked into the ground.
Like a woman playing with puppets. Belavierr just looked…interested. Her hand moved—it caught another arrow. She paused. And then—nodded. She looked at Revi.
“Witnesses.”
“Huh?”
The Stitch Witch nodded.
“Witnesses.”
She lifted her hand—and the shadows stopped moving. The things vanished into the shadows. Belavierr stepped back.
An arrow shot towards her hat. The Stitch Witch made a sound; the arrow detonated. She walked out of the explosion. Her hat and clothing harder than armor for a second. She looked at Halrac.
“Another time. Tell them what you saw.”
That was all. She turned to go. And Revi realized. It was a message. The Stitch Witch began to walk out of the village.
“Stop!”
Halrac shouted. The idiot was still loosing arrows. A mundane one snapped on Belavierr’s clothing. The Stitch Witch turned her head.
“Hm?”
“Why did you do this? Why?”
The Gold-ranked adventurer aimed at Belavierr’s face. She stared at the glowing arrow tip. And she tilted her head left and right.
Waiting for him to fire. Revi felt her skin crawling.
“Halrac…”
The Gold-rank adventurer hesitated. Something was flickering in Belavierr’s gaze. The disinterest, that vacant, distant, immortal look was becoming more lucid. And as she came into the world—Revi saw it.
A bit of malice. She looked at the [Veteran Scout]. He paused.
And lowered his bow. The Stitch Witch, the Spider of Terandria, nodded. She spoke one word, an answer.
“Evil.”
A word, as abstract as could be. Almost a question. She paused, looking around. And then she turned. Belavierr walked away. A shadow, flickering across the ground.
She was gone. Revi collapsed onto the ground. She felt as though her strings were cut. She looked at her team. The other adventurers, miraculously alive. Because death wasn’t the point. Only the byproduct.
All of this? An empty village? The flesh-giant? It was a [Witch] playing at evil. A symbol, a message.
A mother’s love.

The adventurers. The flesh-golem. Even events now as minor as Lacel the Leaper’s crippling. It had happened, and rumors spread.
Invrisil, the City of Adventurers heard a name that night. A legend, rekindled. The spider scuttled out into the light.
Belavierr. And the Guild of Assassins was for once out-shadowed. But they had sent a message to Izril. Runners could be targeted. And the people who believed in things like ‘pillars of society’, and ‘law’, and ‘justice’ realized the truth. Such things only existed as long as the Stitch Witch decided to obey them.
But her actions were not unnoticed. Nor that of the powerful Assassin’s Guild. Gold-ranks could not stop either. But they were not the only people who opposed such things. Nor even the Hunter’s Guild, or [Knights] alone. There were others.
It had been a bad night. Magnolia Reinhart sipped from a cup of a tea. She had not slept. But the daylight felt false to her.
The shadows were long. And she tasted it, despite the sugar in her drink.
“An old monster has scuttled into my lands, Ressa. And the Assassins are making their move. Something will have to be done.”
“Yes, Lady Magnolia. Should we get brooms and dustpans?”
“Not for a spider, Ressa. Send some [Messages]. The Guild can wait. But this is one large spider. Let the Runner’s Guild handle the [Assassins] for now.”
“Surely they received the [Message].”
