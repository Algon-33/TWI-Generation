And bounced off the light. Klbkch stared. And then he raised his other hand. Shielding his face. Because the light was brilliant.
A warm glow. White, but not searing. Not to Pawn. A beautiful light, like the sun rising, shining through the windows. It enfolded him, a beam of light from the heavens. Invisible, but there.
Made of faith. Conjured by a…Skill.
Or rather, a miracle.
[Miracle – Holy Barrier]. A power not of magic. Nor Skill. Something old.
Something new. Made of sacrifices. Made…purely of love. Of faith. A miracle for the Antinium. And it changed reality. It changed everything.
“Do you see? Look. [Holy Barrier]. I leveled up. I tried to tell you.”
Pawn spoke to Klbkch. The Antinium was staring. He slashed—the light repelled his blade. It wasn’t solid, and it wasn’t just light either. It was something…undefinable.
Saved by belief. Pawn honestly didn’t know how long it would last. But he hoped. He believed. He looked at Klbkch.
Ineffable, intangible. The Antinium stared at something new. Something no Antinium had possessed before.
“You.”
“I am a [Priest]. Klbkch. This is mine. Please. Listen—”
Please, the Worker pleaded. Look. Listen. See. Even in despair, even underground, see the light. See—hope. Look upon it.
Believe.
And the old Antinium looked. He saw the [Priest]’s miracle. The impossible thing he had wrought.
He screamed. The sound was wretched, a howl louder than belief. It dimmed the light. It echoed through the Hive.
A sound of hatred. Of disgust. Horror.
Vengeance.
The sword lanced at Pawn. It stuck in the air. The [Holy Barrier] flickered. Klbkch stared at Pawn.
“You will stop me with a thing of faith? Of dead gods?”
“Klbkch. I—”
“Stop me? With that? Stop me? Me? Me? MememEMEmEmemEMe—”
The Antinium vanished. The Worker, clutching his censer, saw a flicker. Fast—like a shadow. The Slayer moved.
A sword—piercing from behind. Pawn turned. Klbkch stopped in the air, straining. The barrier of faith blocked him.
“Klbkch—”
“You cannot stop me. I will slay you. I will slay it.”
The whisper became a scream. And then—the figure moved. Shaking, blurring.
The thing stabbed at Pawn, screaming. Speaking. The blade moved, stuck in the air.
“I will slay ___.”
It leapt back. Moved.
The sword sliced through the air. Through the light. Closer. Through faith. Pawn saw it bury itself deeper in his barrier. The thing whispered.
“I will slay ███.”
Closer. Pawn saw the blade twisting, moving. It withdrew. And then—
Darkness in the light. Pawn lifted his censer—looked down.
The blade twisted in his stomach. Green blood flowed. The Antinium spoke, tearing the barrier of faith asunder.
“I will slay God.”
Pawn choked. The blade was cutting up. He reached for faith. For a miracle. But there was none. Just it.
Him. The Antinium who would cut faith. Cut divinity. It moved, whispering profane words. And Pawn—had nothing more.
He felt the cold blade. And—he tried to dream of heaven. But he thought of Lyonette instead. Pawn tried…to…
“Believe.”
The voice was not his. He heard a sound. And then—there was light.
Not the light of faith. Not the light of miracles. Mortal light. But—special.
Magical. It picked up Klbkch, and threw him across the barracks. The Centenium blurred, screaming, landed—
And there stood a Centenium. She stood, her eyes shining with the light of hope. Gold, and blue, and green, and red—so many colors, mixing and shimmering that they could not be counted. The Centenium lifted her staff as Klbkch stared.
“X—”
