“I owed you a punch. And if you met my friend, she’d probably give you ten times that. If she didn’t try to stab you first. I heard about what happened to the Goblins at Liscor.”
“I bet you did. What do they say?”
“Oh, glorious praise about how Tyrion defeated the Goblin Lord while the Drakes hid behind their walls. Propaganda. But I know Goblins. Tell me. Do you know Goblins? You sounded like you knew them, a bit.”
Ryoka stared at the young man sitting across from her. Laken felt at his stomach.
“If I throw up, don’t tell Gamel. He’ll clean it up and probably try to stab you. Just help me find a rag. Yes. I think I know Goblins. But I didn’t back when I just got to this world. Listen. I don’t want to defend myself.”
“No, go ahead. The punch doesn’t judge what happened before. Just the end result.”
Laken glared. Then he spoke slowly, measuring his words.
“The first time I met Goblins, they were trying to kill everyone in Riverfarm. Perhaps I should have realized they weren’t all like that. But I was told monsters were monsters. That was my mistake. That, and giving Tyrion Veltras weapons to use against the Drakes.”
Ryoka paused. As explanations went, that was pretty good.
“So you know?”
“That’s they’re people? Yes. Listening to them scream at Liscor would have been enough. But I met a Goblin Chieftain the day my army attacked theirs at Lancrel. And she…spoke. She was a person. Ryoka, I know just what I did. And I wish I could turn back time. I just didn’t know until that moment. And after…the trebuchets brought me into a war.”
The young woman was silent. She nodded abruptly, closing her eyes.
“That was my fault as well. And look where it got us. Those Drakes were a direct result of the siege on Liscor, I’ll bet anything.”
“Yeah. Just like home. It’s a mess. And everyone’s telling me what monsters Drakes are. What awful things they’ve done. But—let me know if they’re any different than Goblins.”
“Nope. Bit scalier. Hot tempered. Stubborn. Pretty damn Human, really.”
“That’s what I thought. Gnolls?”
“Furry Humans. Pretty decent people. Don’t blow up their shops.”
Laken sighed. He massaged his stomach, and then put his head down on the table.
“I am in so much pain.”
“Good.”
“Do you feel like hitting me again? Because I can’t stop you and I’d like to get it over with. What do you think? How bad am I on the tyranny scale?”
“Give me a while and let me see. Honestly, aside from the Goblins, you haven’t done too bad.”
“Thanks.”
Ryoka shook her head.
“It doesn’t mean I trust you. I trusted you in Invrisil. And look what happened. Maybe you did what anyone would have done. But you’re an [Emperor]. And you’ve done terrible things. Some good things. But I don’t trust you.”
Laken paused. And the pain that crossed his face wasn’t all due to the punch.
“That’s fair. Can I earn your trust?”
“Maybe. But not today. You could start by telling me, truthfully, what you’re doing.”
“You saw what I was doing.”
“Rebuilding. What comes after that?”
The [Emperor] shrugged. He sat up, grabbed his cup, and drank.
“I have a few ideas. Mainly, it will be turning Riverfarm into an actual place. One that has goods to export, has a reason for people to pay attention to it. Besides the trebuchets. Deal with the [Witches]. Forge an alliance between Riverfarm, and Gralton and Yitton’s lands. Basic stuff like that.”
“Fair enough. So you don’t have a grand plan?”
“I have multiple plans. Whether they’re grand is debatable. You want me to get into detail?”
