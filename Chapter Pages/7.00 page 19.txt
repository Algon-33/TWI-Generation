The inn was very quiet. The Drake passed by another opening in the wall. Put a crossbow or bow there and you could hit him from either side. And there’d be acid pouring down from the ceiling. Come to that—why was the magic door along the far wall? Maybe—
Something leapt on him. Relc screamed and whirled, spear in hand.
“Gaaaah!”
He nearly stabbed the furry, white shape tackling his legs. Nearly. But he saw Mrsha and stopped. Klbkch had nearly unsheathed his blades as well.
“You little rascal! Where did you come from?”
Relc’s heart was pounding out of his chest. He stared at Mrsha. The white Gnoll grinned up at him. She punched Relc’s legs, raced about him on all fours, and then held up her paws. She waved one paw, made a gesture where her paw closed and opened wide. It was her way of saying ‘hello! Tricked you!’
Mrsha, the white Gnoll cub giggled at the look on Relc’s face. The Drake raised his fist.
“Why, I oughta—take this!”
He punched. Klbkch staggered as Relc hit him in the shoulder. The Antinium caught himself, stared at Relc.
“Why did you do that?”
“I had to punch someone!”
“No you did not. I am extremely angry.”
“Where did you come from, though?”
Relc ignored Klbkch’s wrath and turned to Mrsha. She hadn’t come through the double doors; they’d closed behind them. The magic door? No. Relc looked around and frowned at Mrsha. The Gnoll was giving him the smuggest look he’d ever seen on a Gnoll’s face.
“Hey. You little scamp. How’d you sneak up on us? Answer me!”
Mrsha gave Relc a very Goblin-like shrug. But her eyes twinkled. Relc raised a fist.
“Don’t make me punch Klbkch again!”
“I will stab you first.”
For answer, Mrsha pointed. Relc looked as she pointed behind her, and then made another gesture where she covered her eyes and peeked.
“I have no idea what she’s saying. Do you know what her sign language is, Klb?”
“Hm. Cover eyes. Peeking. Don’t look? No—ah. Hidden. Secret.”
Mrsha nodded excitedly. She pointed and Relc saw her scamper over to a piece of wood near the entryway. His eyes narrowed as she pushed on it. Then he saw the cleverly disguised—
“Door! Look, it’s a door!”
Klbkch nodded. Mrsha disappeared through a hidden door. Relc realized there were two, one on each side of the entryway. He looked around.
“Of course! So they can get at the door. But if they don’t like who’s coming in…arrows! Boiling curry! Evil Gnoll cubs!”
He waved his claws at the cleverly-designed hallway. Klbkch eyed the closed secret door. Mrsha had swung it inwards. He went over and pushed on the section of the wall. Nothing happened. Klbkch tried harder. Relc thought he heard silent laughter coming from behind it.
“I believe the door is able to be barred from the other side. Clever.”
“Yeah. Unless you do this! Hah!”
Relc charged into the secret door. Klbkch heard a thud, and an alarmed sound from behind the wall. Relc picked himself up from the floor.
“Ow.”
“Erin’s Skills appear to be in effect. And you appear to be an idiot.”
“Klb. I don’t appear to be anything. Wait. That’s some tough wall.”
Relc rose, rubbing at his head. More relaxed now, he looked around. The double doors at the far end had opened, and a warm glow greeted him. The Drake inhaled and smelled…sawdust. But also, warm food. He grinned.
“Klb, do you remember when we first came to this inn?”
“I distinctly recall it was another inn, set further to the east. But yes.”
“Strange. Feels like a lot’s changed. A lot.”
The Drake nodded. He just looked around for a moment. Then he smiled.
“Alright. Let’s open that door!”
