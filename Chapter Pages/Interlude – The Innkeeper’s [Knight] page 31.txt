Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 31
She winked at him. Rabbiteater wondered if she said that to the other Redfangs. Maybe. But she smiled at him and he believed her. He went back to peeling potatoes. And that was all. Erin hummed as the only Redfang who had time to learn to cook helped her make dinner.
Her great, brave friend.

They all were. Erin’s eyes were overfull. The [Scribe] looked at her.
“Sorry—can I get some room?”
“Of course, Miss. I’ll just…call me if you need me.”
She nodded. Her brave Goblin protector. Headscratcher. Shorthilt.
He was alive. In danger. More than anything—more than being courted, given gems? She pulled out the emerald and wondered how much it would go for. She could pay. She would pay.
But she wished she could see him. Her fingers were tight on the quill.
 
Okay. 
 
The response was hesitant. Erin could see there was someone else writing another response; the Goblin’s response was slower, clumsier. It was him writing. They were talking. If only…
 
Is that an affirmation that the ransom can be paid? For both artifacts, the addition in gold will be—
 
Erin scribbled over the writing and it stopped. She dipped her quill in ink.
 
Ser Solstice, have you been eating well?
Yes. Good food.
Two hundred gold pieces per artifact, at two coming to a full total of—
Shut up. Ask Ser Solstice if he remembers the guy who keeps playing the guitar.
I remember.
—500 gold pieces! 500 gold, due within two days.
He’s getting fat. I think he misses you.
 
Silence. Rabbiteater hunted for his quill. He’d dropped it. His hands were trembling.
 
He is fat?
Getting fatter. Also, needs deodorant. That’s…smelling stuff for sweat.
Miss Solstice, can you pay the fee?
He is well? Is there…anyone else?
I met a guy who likes to shoot arrows. But no. I miss you.
I’m sorry.
Ailendamus will accept the payment to any Merchant’s Guild—shut up shut up!
Are you okay? Why did you go, Ser Solstice?
 
What did he say to that? The Goblin hesitated.
 
Okay. No need to pay. 
Ignore that. We’re willing to accept 400 pieces contingent on immediate payment for both [Knight] and equipment.
Cross out his words again and you’ll regret it, buddy.
 
The [Lieutenant] stared at the line and at the [Knight].
“Who is this?”
The Goblin didn’t answer.
 
Sorry. Had to go.
I think I understand. I’ll pay. Can I help you?
You gave me too much already. I left. Is okay.
No. We miss you. Are you with [Knights]?
300 GOLD PIECES. RELEASE UPON DELIVERY GUARANTEED. PAY VIA MERCHANT’S GUILD AND SEND CONFIRMATION TO GENERAL YERZHEN ARMY. END OF COMMUNICATIONS.
 
Erin stared as the paper stopped glowing. She tried writing, but the scroll had deactivated. She looked around and huffed.
“How rude!”
For a moment. Then—she looked at the paper and took it in. Ransom? Hostage? He was in disguise, then. She shuddered. Then she shot out of her chair.
“Rabbiteater!”

“Ridiculous. The Earl shouldn’t be competing for her hand. She should either accept with incredible gratitude or decline!”
Kiish was still furious. People were looking for Erin—she’d vanished. You had to watch her. Take your eye off her for one second—the Earl was doing well. But the cracks were showing in his strategy.
To be fair, he’d gotten far. But she couldn’t even understand why it was an issue. One of Desonis’ [Knights] was of the same opinion.
“No disrespect to the [Innkeeper]. But Miss Erin Solstice is…an [Innkeeper]. Her Majesty won’t allow this even if his lordship petitions her.”
