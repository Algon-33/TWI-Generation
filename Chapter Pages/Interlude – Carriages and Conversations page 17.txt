Interlude – Carriages and Conversations

It was a journey he doubted he’d return from. But that was fine. Rabbiteater began plucking the Quillfish. He’d try cooking it, or ask the [Cook] to do so for some of the meat. And when he ate in his quarters, he would remember home.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: Three days remain until the launch of The Last Tide, Part 1. I think this chapter is okay. I had little sleep and I might not for a few of these days.
It’s hot. Air conditioning is…problematic for a little bit. Which I don’t like. Blergh. And this chapter is short.
Because I plan to write another one tomorrow. Remember my birthday? We’re doing that.
AGAIN.
Hear me out. It’s not because I have less work or just the comic. It’s because I have more work. And I need to take two weeks off, instead of one. I’m fairly certain that will allow me to catch up on all the TWI-projects, among them getting Volume 3’s e-book ready so I can publish it so it can be made into an audiobook!
But two weeks off, from the 15th to the end of August is a long time. So for the next six days now, we’re going with a chapter a day. Usually around this length, a little shorter if need be! I hope that excuses two weeks off. Look forwards to daily streams and postings; Public readers will NOT get any of the chapters except at the regular times. I’ll post the rest like they’re normal chapters, but you’ll get a chapter a day.
Look forwards to Tuesday’s chapter. Thanks for reading!
