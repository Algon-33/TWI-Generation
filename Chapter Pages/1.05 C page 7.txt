Shadows in the night. The [Clown] laughs as he tears the sword away from the first Demon and runs the second through. The warriors stab into his stomach. One nearly cuts his arm off. The [Clown] laughs. He grabs one of the warriors, ignoring the blade in his stomach.
“Hahahahahahaha—gotcha!”
He vanishes along with the warrior he’s holding. The Demons turn. They search for their comrade as one of their number bleeds and dies on the ground. The Human is nowhere to be seen. They continue onwards. They go for ten feet when they hear a voice.
“Hey. Miss me?”
Someone steps out from the shadows behind them. The [Clown] grins. His wounds on his stomach are closed. His arm is intact. He raises two knives and throws them as the Fearless turn. One strikes just above an ear; the other Demon dodges.
“That’s one. Two, if you count the guy I killed. And the girl I grabbed. That was a girl, right?”
The Fearless are without fear. They charge at him, trying to maneuver in the tight corridor. The [Clown] laughs as he cuts into them. Without fear. They cut each other. He grabs another and vanishes. They turn and run.
“Do you want to know how I got these scars? Wait a second—”
He appears down the next corridor, laughing. His wounds are closed. He smiles at the Fearless.
“Have we met before?”
They pause. They stare at him. The Fearless feel no fear. They cannot. Unease, trepidation, terror—all are emotions they have forgotten. But they still feel. And what they feel is—
Disturbed. The [Clown] strolls towards them. They back up. This time they loose arrows at him. They burn his body with magic. He vanishes, laughing.
He appears again minutes later. The Fearless split up. They feel no fear. But they do not understand. He’s laughing. As they cut him, he laughs, as he bleeds, he laughs. And each time they grow fewer in number.
The next time the [Clown] appears, the Fearless retreat. They do not feel fear. But that means they do not understand it either. All they feel is confusion. Uncertainty. They break and run against an enemy they cannot kill. And the [Clown] laughs. He turns.
And vanishes.

I love a good show. So when I appear in the banquet hall, I twirl. The [Mage] who teleported me steps back. I pat his cheek.
“Thanks for the pickup! Beam me up…uh, your name isn’t Scotty, is it?”
He’s panting too hard to speak. Nereshal walks towards me. He has a gash on a cheek. I saw him freeze a corridor full of Demons. All I had to do was walk up and stab them. He takes all the fun out of life.
“Are the Demons still present in that corridor?”
I shrug.
“They ran.”
“The Fearless?”
“Yeah. False advertising, I call that. Anyways, how are things?”
He ignores me and walks over to a map. The Blighted King is standing over it, plotting the Demon’s advance. Nereshal flicks his fingers, and a corridor clears. One corridor. Most are red, showing Demon-controlled territory, or contested. I lean on the [Mage] who teleported me until he falls down.
“Hey King, what’s up? Are we losing? I bet we are.”
The Blighted King stares at me as I bounce over. Isodore, standing at his side, stares at me. At my stomach.
“You’re bleeding.”
“Am I? I barely noticed. Wait a second, how bad is it?”
I turn, and the people at the table gasp. I look at my back.
“Huh. I could have sworn I had flesh there. Is my spine supposed to look like that?”
“Healing potion!”
There’s already one coming this way. I grab it. The [Healer] babbles something about using it slowly, not straining my body, and so on. I wrestle with her for the bottle.
“Come on, come on, I’m wasting time here. Give me that!”
