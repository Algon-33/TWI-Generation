Fear made Maviola gulp reflexively. She gasped in pain. Az’kerash glanced at Belavierr.
“Your puppets went undetected. The flame spell I cast was realistic enough. Have you more need of my…aid, Belavierr?”
“Only in the creation of my servant. I have long waited for the right vessel for my child.”
Belavierr spoke. Each word filled Maviola with a mounting horror. She looked around at the Chosen.
“They—they have souls.”
Az’kerash’s eyes brightened.
“You can see them.”
It was not a question. Maviola looked at him. And a second wave of revulsion struck her.
“You gave the undead souls? They have classes! They level!”
“Yes.”
She struggled harder. If she could have summoned the same fire that had destroyed ‘her’, she would have.
“This is madness! You will end this world! You are party to this, Stitch Witch? Spider?”
“We work together. Our magics will create that which has never been seen. I have already given my thread. I only awaited a body. You.”
Belavierr bent closer. Maviola spat. The spit hit Belavierr. The [Witch] curiously regarded Maviola, oblivious.
“You burned me.”
“Is that the only reason?”
Maviola sneered. Belavierr smiled again.
“Yes. Now you will suffer. That. Is vengeance. I remember it, now.”
“Shall I leave you, Belavierr? Summon me when you are finished.”
Az’kerash turned. He did not seem comfortable around Belavierr’s gloating, even as a fellow immortal. The Chosen began to leave as well. A skeleton with purple eyes tiptoed after them. He really hated the family events.
The puppets remained. Belavierr’s whisper to Maviola made the Necromancer halt, though. She bent over Maviola.
“You will not die immediately. Do you know what this is?”
She produced a viridian vial. Maviola gasped.
“My—”
The last Potion of Youth. Belavierr held it over Maviola. The puppet had picked it up on the battlefield.
“One week. And however many days you have left. Your thread is nearly out.”
“You will get nothing from my body. I wish you all the best of an old woman’s corpse!”
Maviola laughed. Belavierr shook her head.
“You will be young. Drop. Drop. You will not die. And you will suffer.”
Maviola inhaled. The [Stitch Witch] moved, around her other side.
“It will take a long time. Weeks. Months. I have my own ways. You will not enjoy it. You will suffer. I have forgotten how. You will teach me.”
“I will give you nothing.”
“Not today.”
The Spider whispered. Her shadow moved on the wall. The darkness became more absolute. Her voice grew deeper. The rings in her eyes expanding.
“You will suffer until you break. Until you scream. That is not enough. You will suffer until you beg me to die. That is not enough.”
Her hands tightened on Maviola’s arm. The face leaned closer.
“You will give me everything. Pledge your soul to me gratefully. Then you will die.”
The [Lady] cried out. Fear. Revulsion. And fury. It swept through her chest. She tried to pull away, look away from Belavierr’s gaze. She saw—
The Necromancer stood in the doorway. His eyes reflected something. She shouted at him.
“Necromancer! Az’kerash! Peril Chandler!” 
Toren saw the pretty eyes burning. Why did he like her? Why did he want to—he saw the Necromancer jerk.
Maviola El shouted at him.
“I heard stories of Archmage Chandler’s fall! I knew the Necromancer’s great crimes. The death he brought to a kingdom of Terandria! But I also heard of the man whom they called the Great Necromancer of Terandria! The man who made his class respected! I always wondered how the two could be the same person.”
“Your point, Maviola El?”
Belavierr glanced up, annoyance crossing her features. Maviola was panting.
