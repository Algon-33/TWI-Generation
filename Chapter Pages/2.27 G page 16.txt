There was no word for ‘rags’ in the language of Goblins. Rags had to sound out the word slowly. Garen frowned, and then laughed as he realized what she was saying.
“Rags? It is good name. Good name for Goblin.”
He spoke! Rags was so stunned she took a step back. Garen had spoken! Not with the Goblin’s language, but like a Human or a Drake or Gnoll! She’d thought that was impossible.
 
How? How speak?
 
He shrugged carelessly in reply.
“Many days practice. Many, many days. Learned to once, when adventurer.”
 
Liar.
 
“No liar. Was once adventurer. Became strong. Strongest.”
That was impossible. Even the most tolerant Human would kill any Goblin—especially a Hob—on sight. But Garen just grinned when Rags said that.
“Special adventurers. Once. Trusted me.”
 
And?
 
Rags was intensely curious, but Garen’s face closed. He studied the fire, and looked at her.
“Trusted. I fought with them until one day. Then I killed them.”
Rags was suddenly bursting with questions. She wanted to ask them all, but Garen looked at her, and she realized he had something to say.
 
Came here to find Chieftain. Me or you. Must unite tribes.
Why?
Enemy is South. Great enemy. Bad Goblin. Goblin Lord.
 
Goblin Lord. Rags stared at Garen as his words struck her. No. It couldn’t be. But if he said it—
She stared at the sky. The cloudy sky. It was a peaceful night now, now that the bloodshed had stopped. But if Garen was right, it explained everything. Bad Goblin? A bad Goblin Lord? If that was the case, then—
She looked out at her tribe. If that was the case…if a Goblin Lord was really growing, then it meant only one thing.
It meant all of the violence, all the death before this was only an opening act. A Goblin Lord was rising, and with it, war would engulf this region.
Garen grinned, and in his eyes Rags saw fire and war and death. She couldn’t help it. She laughed, and felt the world begin to move again.
