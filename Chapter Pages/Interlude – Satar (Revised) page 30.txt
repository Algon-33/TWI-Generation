“Don’t know. When moons come, we look. But below is death. Above—no way out. Want to leave. Try to leave. No way out. Until bugs dig in.”
Antinium. The Antinium had unearthed the dungeon. The Raskghar had been…trapped? A buzz began, following this new idea, but Theikha had already lifted a paw.
“One more question, Asoma. Then you can go and eat. Tell me what you told Chieftain Reizet. What you told the others. Raskghar want to eat Gnolls. Your tribe wanted to be free of the dungeon.”
“Yes. Facestealer. Hrr. Facestealer. Mother. Bad things. Facestealer killed Stalker. Can’t kill Facestealer. Nothing kills Facestealer. And Mother is there.”
“Who is…?”
“Some kind of high-level monster down there.”
Mrell’s [Shaman] whispered back. But he didn’t know who…Mother was.
“Where would you go if you left the dungeon? If you didn’t—couldn’t eat Gnolls? Tell me what you said, Asoma. You can eat as much meat as you want. What did you say?”
Theikha coaxed. Asoma stared at her and around the room. She was clearly thinking, trying to figure out if she should say it. But the lure was too appealing, and she…she didn’t understand why it would matter. So she grinned and said it.
“Find people. Find more. Make more Raskghar. More, and more.”
Suddenly, Mrell had stopped breathing. He leaned over his seat, and Theikha whispered.
“Now, how would you do that, Asoma? Your tribe is the only one, isn’t it?”
The Raskghar frowned, then smiled.
“No. No…more Raskghar. Down deep. More Raskghar. Right there. See? See?”
She lifted one talon and pointed. Mrell saw her point, not randomly, but to the side—and down. Down. Theikha heard the low moan around the room and raised a paw.
“That’s enough. Take her away.”

It was a long time before order was restored. Even then, Krshia’s breathing was shaky.
There were more Raskghar? She hadn’t known that. Now, she understood why Theikha had brought Asoma here.
“The Raskghar revealed that during questioning. They didn’t even think to hide it, and they do have more secrets. They didn’t think it was something to hide. Mind you—we questioned them during the day, far away from full moon cycles. They’re too intelligent under the moons. They tried picking locks, and communicated—even by thumping the ground and hearing each other. We’ve begun putting them to sleep those nights.”
Reizet finished the summary. She looked around as Theikha retired. The [Shaman] seemed exhausted from that brief encounter, and it was the [Chieftains]’ turn to take the stage.
“I don’t know about you, but I see it one way. The Raskghar live. They live…in dungeons. In places hidden away from time. As Grand Strategist Chaldion said—we have enemies. We have enemies, and the Raskghar live, despite our wars to destroy them. Now, who could arrange that? Plant a seed of death to emerge later? Whenever they wanted to hurt us?”
The Az’muzarre Chieftain’s voice was too calm. Too…she looked around, and her answer came in an instant.
“Drakes. Only Drakes build dungeons. They did this. Just like our magic. It’s always them.”
A cursing voice. Growls of agreement. Xherw rose to his feet.
“I will not say it outright, but yes. Perhaps Drakes. The truth is we do not know. Maybe they fled. I counsel thought, Chieftains.”
