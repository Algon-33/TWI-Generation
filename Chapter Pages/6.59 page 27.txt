“I couldn’t believe it. One of our kind? Reduced to this? Look at you. You’re more pathetic than I could have imagined. Why are you here? You’ve been judged guilty. Why hasn’t Liscor executed you? You’d be dead in any port of Minos within the day for your crimes! Well? Answer!”
The Minotaur spoke slowly. He closed his eyes, trying to breathe. Explain, though part of him agreed with every word.
“I could have been ensorcelled. I am still not sure if I was—”
“You are not.”
He froze. His heart stopped. Beza looked at him and shook her head.
“I cast [Detect Magic] the instant I saw you. There is none about you, save for the magic in the cell.”
“The Watch Captain of this city believes the spell may be more complex than that. She believes I may be innocent.”
Calruz protested. He watched Beza. She twitched when he mentioned Zevara. What was going on? She glared at him and spat. It hit the barrier and fizzled.
“Excuse. You are a coward who fears death!”
“I do not.”
Calruz’ growled. Even as a captive, even as he was, that strung what remained of his pride. Beza sneered at him.
“You’ve been prisoner for months! Any self-respecting warrior would have done what’s right. Ensorcelled? By what? You murdered Gnolls. Children. I heard all about your crimes. Because of you, the people of this city feared me.”
The Minotaur [Prisoner] looked down. He clenched his one hand.
“I have no excuse, kindred. But the Watch Captain refuses to grant me death. She believes in me. So I remain.”
“You have no right to call me kindred. And I know what needs to be done.”
Beza’s voice was very cold. She stared at Calruz. She was taller than he was. She nodded down the length of the prison and then stepped forwards. He looked up as she whispered to him.
“I’ll find a way to smuggle in a knife to you. You do the proper thing.”
“But that’s—”
He jerked. She glared at him and pounded a fist on the barrier to his cell. The light flashed, but didn’t even waver.
“That’s the honorable thing to do! You should have done it long ago, coward. Look at you, sleeping with rats? What’s next? I’ll get the knife in. Bribe the guards, perhaps. It won’t take me more than a day or two.”
She turned away dismissively. Calruz stared at her back. He couldn’t bear it any longer. He spoke up, angrily.
“I have a question. Are you an arbiter of the isles? You did not announce yourselves as such. Do you have that authority?”
Beza turned. She hesitated, which was answer enough.
“I have the right of every Minos to judge another! I came here because I heard you’d disgraced our kind!”
Calruz’ eyes narrowed. So, not the arbiter he’d feared. Still—a thought occurred to him. He stared at Beza.
“Who did you come here to apprehend?”
She paused. He stared at her.
“Who?”
“Do not make demands of me, traitor.”
She glared at him. But Calruz was unwavering. After a moment, Beza spat.
“A member of your team. Pisces Jealnet. A [Necromancer]. If I thought you could sink no lower, I was wrong. That he claims to be part of a team that calls itself the ‘Horns of Hammerad’? Ludicrous!”
Calruz’s stomach twisted. Pisces? What had he done? No, Ceria had told him something of Pisces’ past. He stepped forwards, towards the magical barrier that kept him caged.
“Did you capture him?”
“We did. But thanks to the laws of this pathetic city he was released. He won’t escape us a second time. Him or the team protecting him.”
Bezale snarled. She was angry. She’d come here angry; Calruz could see it from the red seeping into her eyes. He growled.
“His team? If you touched Ceria Springwalker—”
“You’ll do what?”
