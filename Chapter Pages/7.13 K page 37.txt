Raelt hit the wall of stone. He felt something explode. The impact sent him down, but he was getting up. And he was free—
The King of Destruction pulled the sword out of his chest as his wounds healed. He tossed the rapier to the ground and Raelt saw him move. Raelt tried to dodge, but his legs slipped. Something was wrong—he needed his sword—
Flos Reimarch grabbed Raelt as the [Duelist] slipped. Raelt’s body wasn’t working right. He punched the King of Destruction in the face. And Flos seized Raelt’s armor and ran with him into the wall of stone.
Jecaina saw the wall of stone crack. Then, both [Kings] crashed through it. Raelt lay on the ground as the King of Destruction hurled him through the wall. The King of Jecrass wasn’t moving. He twitched as Flos casually coughed and checked the wound on his chest. Flos took another drink of a healing potion.
Raelt reached for his. He broke the glass vials on his chest as many as he could grab. His bones—he rolled away as Flos charged at him. The King of Destruction grabbed him. Threw him again.
Flashes of light. Raelt hit the broken [Wall of Stone] again. He couldn’t move for a crucial second. His body was breaking, healing—he saw Flos running at him. A fist—
Raelt raised his hands. The impact pushed him through the wall. He lay on the ground.
Get up. He had to get up or he’d die. The [Duelist] rolled. He saw a blade miss his head. Flos Reimarch had grabbed a weapon. Raelt got to his feet. He saw his rapier. He dove for it.
The King of Destruction slashed, and missed. He watched as Raelt grabbed the blade. The [Duelist] rose.
Out of potions. Something was still broken. He was coughing up blood. A lung? He looked at the King of Destruction.
Neither man said a word. No quarter, no mercy. Raelt was out of Skills. Flos Reimarch slowly advanced. The [Duelist] sighed. He lifted his blade and advanced.

The golden bell rang. Jecaina watched her father fighting. He had no tricks left. He wasn’t even able to keep his distance. He just cut, aiming at Flos’ face as the King of Destruction slowly wore him down. Another blow—Raelt went stumbling backwards.
“No.”
The [Princess] of Jecrass breathed. She saw her father stumbling, falling to one knee. He’d broken something. He kept spitting blood. Flos of Reim advanced, cautiously. Unwilling to give Raelt another opening.
“He can’t die.”
Jecaina whispered. She looked around. But both armies were silent. Watching the end.
“His Majesty—”
Geril was trembling. The old retainer looked at Raelt. Jecaina saw him looking at her father. Then at her.
“Milady. You can’t—”
He seized her. Jecaina didn’t know why. Then she realized.
She’d drawn her sword. She was fighting Geril.
“Let me go. I have to save him.”
“No, milady. Your majesty. The honor of Jecrass is at stake! You cannot!”
Jecaina didn’t want to hear. But the other [Soldiers], General Lael saw. They grabbed the [Princess], held her back.
“No, no. Let me go! I command you!”
She didn’t care about the honor of the duel. She just wanted her father to live. He was stumbling backwards again. The King of Destruction wasn’t even wounded. Wasn’t even tired. Jecaina pleaded.
“You have to do something. Please—”
She looked at General Lael. And then at Geril. The old man looked at her. He looked at Raelt.
The King of Jecrass was going to die. He would not yield. And nor would Flos Reimarch give him any mercy. Not in this duel. Not with both nation’s honor on the line. There was only one way.
If someone disgraced their honor. Geril studied the hauberk he wore. His old hands gripped the spear he carried. He looked up.
