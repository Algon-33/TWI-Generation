They were coming. In the distance, the terrible clash of metal and distant chanting echoed into the smithy. Teres looked outside and a single horn blew close by. Still, the young woman waited. She was not needed. Not yet. She looked at Nawal, fully sheathed her sword, and spoke.
“I don’t know what star I was born under. Where I come from, my world, we have no portents or signs. Or if we do—they’re silly. They don’t have magic in them. Few people believe in fate.”
Nawal’s head rose slightly.
“Where is that? Trey never…said. Which land?”
“The United Kingdom. London.”
“I don’t know…”
“Another world, Nawal. Not this one.”
The [Smith] looked blankly at Teres. It wasn’t exactly an earth-shaking revelation. She was just…tired. Teres went on after a moment.
“Our father raised us alone. Poor guy. We weren’t rich, but it wasn’t that bad. We weren’t…”
She looked around the forge.
“Special. And we weren’t bad. That was who we were. Twins. Trey and me. Then, we came here. We teleported into the King of Destruction’s throne room and woke him up.”
“Aaah. So that’s how.”
Nawal looked up, a flash of interest entering her eyes. Teres nodded.
“Luck. Chance. Fate. Whatever you want to call it. For a year, we’ve been by his side, or fighting for Reim in some way. Trey hates some of it. I do too, but I fought. I like Orthenon. Trey’s somewhere else. Wistram, I think. But Flos wouldn’t tell me his big plan. If…”
There was a crash. Something—a ram running into a door?—far distant. Both women went still, and Teres listened, but the roar in the background didn’t change. She went on.
“…he’ll be safe. I hope he will be. He takes bigger risks than I do.”
Nawal nodded. She looked at Teres.
“He hated what you did. He did not tell me why. But you two split.”
“Around slavery. Around following Flos.”
Teres nodded. She leaned against the doorframe, staring outwards. Then she turned back to Nawal.
“You can run. But you’re not going to. You’re so guilty about what you did—make the Naq-Alrama steel again. He will forgive you. There is redemption.”
“Not if Reim falls here. Nor if his wrath falls on us when he recovers.”
The [Bladeswoman] sighed. She scratched at her head.
“I didn’t like you that much when you were sharp-tongued and rude, Nawal. But I liked you more than now. Your father made this mess, not you. It’s your choice to take all the blame and sit here forging crap steel.”
“It’s not crap steel.”
The [Smith] muttered. She looked up as Teres kicked at a pebble with a boot.
“It’s far worse than what you can do. I know that. You’re one of the greatest smiths ever, a prodigy. Can’t you try?”
Nawal started laughing. She laughed—then choked on her dry throat. Teres fumbled for a water flask and Nawal drank greedily. She wiped at her mouth, nearly threw up as the water went into an empty stomach, and spoke.
“My class? I was a [Peerless Magic Smith]. Peerless. Peerless! As all Clan Tannousin Smiths must be! Now—now—it lies gone. The blood comes for me. I am disgraced. Even the fates know it.”
Teres inhaled.
“…I need to ask Maresar about that. But—”
She glanced outside. The shouting was getting louder. Nawal looked at Teres, and the two exchanged glances. Looked each other right in the eye, for the first time ever, it felt.
“You could run.”
Teres paused by the doorway. She looked at Nawal.
“What?”
“You could run. Trey asked you. You could not ride with the King of Destruction. You do not know his legend. This is not your death. You could run, or live without that in your hand.”
She pointed at the sword Teres had drawn again. Nawal croaked.
“Why?”
