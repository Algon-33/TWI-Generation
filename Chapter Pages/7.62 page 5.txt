She knew. But she didn’t know. And like then—like always. She denied it.
“What has happened, Zevara? Where is Olesm?”
“Gone. To destroy Hectval. I tried to stop him. He’s gone. 4th Company is gone. Adventurers. Civilians. Over half the watch. Two thirds.”
That was an army. The hairs on Maviola’s neck rose. She remembered the disastrous end to the meeting with the Drakes.
“What did…Hectval do?”
“They sent raiding parties to attack Liscor. Four of them. The Antinium got two. The Watch forced one to surrender. The last went for The Wandering Inn.”
And they got killed? Yet Maviola felt it. The slow dance to the center.
“And?”
“She never saw them. They had crossbows. Poisoned damn bolts. She wasn’t in her inn. So—so—”
The Watch Captain never finished the words. The Minotaur’s head rose. Calruz looked at Maviola.
“Erin Solstice is dead.”
The [Lady] had been prepared. She had known—it was Erin, or perhaps Lyonette, or…no. She had known who it must be.
She had known.
The words still sent her stumbling. She looked back, into the Watch House. Zevara drank. The Minotaur sat there, his scars, one stump of an arm—his face grimly resolved for…
She looked at the [Guardswoman]. The grim Gnoll, standing to attention. Waiting for an incident. Crime.
The [Guards] on the gates. The silent, shocked city.
Maviola El looked around. Then she ran. She ran, abandoning her horse. Running for the magic door—
It wasn’t working. Maviola abandoned it. She ran out of the city. The same [Guards] who’d let her through the gates stared at her back. Almost…darkly amused, a hint of it beyond the grief.
Now you know. How could we explain?

The Wandering Inn was dark when Maviola El burst through the doors. Not uncrowded. But the lights had been extinguished. Dimmed where not removed. The windows shuttered.
As if light itself were too cheerful a thing for this place, at this time. Maviola El stopped, panting. She ran down the long, trapped hallway. Past the newly-built portal-room, unoccupied, the door not staffed like usual.
A pair of figures were just opening the door to the common room. One was leaning on the other as she guided him forwards, murmuring.
“It can’t be. Can’t be. Not to some salt-sucking no-name bastards…”
Wailant Strongheart and Viceria entered the common room of the inn. Maviola El caught the door before it closed.
She found the wake, continuing.
No one had cleared away yesterday’s plates and dishes, nor today’s. The kitchen was not lit, full of good smells. No laughter at the tables.
There was sound. Shuffling. Voices. Little weeping. Those in here had little left to cry.
The door to the [Garden of Sanctuary] was open at the far end of the room. Open to all. Sunlight played through the door. A green hill, stretching up, past glowing Sage’s Grass.
Maviola stopped. She saw—as she burst through—a ring of figures stir.
Men with hats. Mostly Human. One, a Drake, one, a Gnoll. They stirred. Weapons in their hands.
Their hats were off.
That was enough to frighten. But they just looked at Wailant, Viceria, and the City Runner who had told them. Their daughter, Garia, stumbling towards the garden. They sat back down as they recognized Maviola.
“Where…?”
She knew, at once. The garden was open. And a Gnoll was walking through. Not one of Erin’s…special friends. Just a Gnoll, that Maviola didn’t recognize. Yet he entered the garden, something in his paws.
Maviola looked for faces she recognized. But the door called her. She slowly began to walk forwards, following the Stronghearts. She entered the garden. And she saw the procession.
