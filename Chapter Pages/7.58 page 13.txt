“Laken. We met on a cold winter, when his village was starving for food and aid. Ivolethe helped me deliver it. It was one strange run, there and back. But I was never prouder of myself. I thought—that was the most important thing I can do with my life. Worth risking my life for. This—I thought it was the same. But is it?”
She looked up. Her green eyes meeting Erin’s.
“I’m afraid of the future, Erin. And I don’t know what to do. What do you think I should do?”
She was asking. And in that moment, the [Innkeeper] looked at her friend. And she felt her heart sink. And rise. And—
The [Innkeeper] stood up. She turned away from Ryoka. Scuffed the floorboards with one foot.
“Hey, have you met my weird friend? She’s a City Runner. Her name’s Ryoka.”
Ryoka smiled. She opened her mouth, then let Erin continue.
“I’ve helped her before. Picked up pieces after she ran. She’s always doing weird stuff. Running here, going into the High Passes. She’s not a great person. She’s good, but not super-great. Really. She has a bad temper, she gets depressed, she can’t even be a proper person, let alone look after friends…”
Erin trailed off, looked at Ryoka. The City Runner smiled bitterly. No objections here. Erin went on.
“…But she always seems to be trying to do the right thing. And that’s why I help her, even if she asks for crazy stuff. Because I admire her. I admire her being brave, even when she’s terrified.”
She looked at the City Runner and saw uncertainty in Ryoka’s face. Erin Solstice saw Ryoka Griffin much like Lyonette had.
This was Ryoka. She looked like one thing. Tall, leggy, confident, certainly with good running form. Brave, intelligent. And she was many of these things. But also—if you knew her—
Ryoka Griffin was a very anxious person.
She planned for the future and didn’t plan for the future.
She talked a big game, but she was no killer, or even cruel.
She wasn’t as fast as she thought she was.
But she was rather kind. She did care about good and evil. And today—Erin Solstice shook her head. She wiped at her eyes.
“Do you have to go?”
“I guess I do.”
Ryoka stood up, slowly. Erin went over to her friend. She hugged her tightly. Like she had in Celum, not wanting to let go.
For a second they stood there. Then a minute. Then…eternity. When she let go, her friend might die. Time would resume. She could hold on forever, like this.
—But she had to let go. She could stop Ryoka. But she could not stop time. And Erin had listened and chosen.
“I’ll try to help if I can. At least a bit.”
Erin snuffled. Ryoka shook her head.
“You don’t need to—it’s the inn I’m worried about.”
“Dummy. I have Skills. You have bare feet and toe fungus.”
“I do not.”
Ryoka Griffin was shaky after that. Erin saw her visibly collect herself as they went into the hallway. But suddenly—it was Erin who was busy and Ryoka who just had to wait.
“One hour and…thirty minutes. Thereabouts. I’ll…I’ll find Mrsha. I need to plot my journey with Fierre. Beyond that? I could practice…no. I’d give it away. I’ll…eat something or something.”
“Right. Don’t go without saying goodbye.”
Erin wiped her face again. Ryoka backed into her room. The two stared at each other for a moment. Nothing more to say? Ryoka turned. Fierre glanced up from her map.
“Have you been crying?”
“Shut up, Fierre.”
The [Innkeeper] smiled as Ryoka closed the door. Then she turned.
Snapjaw was staring at Erin. The [Innkeeper] threw up her arms. The [Big Eater] put a finger to her lips.
