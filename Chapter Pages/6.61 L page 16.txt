And then his head slowly swung back around towards the box of flowers. They were yellow, golden, short. Palt would have dismissed them outright, but something in him took notice. An aspect of his class. Not the [Illusionist]. Not the [Cook]. But the [Smoker].
Palt stared at the flowers. Erin was saying something.
“So, look. About the bounty. Is there any way you can get it removed? It’s not fair, and it’ll get people going after Pisces. Hello? Hello. Are you listening to…”
The flowers. Palt stared, forgetting everything for a moment. He stared at the bright yellow buds, golden, watching the Ashfire Bee sip from one. Every instinct in Palt’s body was telling him to smoke it. Or maybe boil it in some peppermint oil extract. You could take it in droplets or—or maybe some goat’s butter. Yes, heat it up, and bake it into…
“Hey!”
Erin poked Palt. He jumped.
“Don’t kill me! Yes! What? Oh!”
He stared at her. The [Innkeeper] stared at him, and followed his gaze. Palt grinned shakily.
“I apologize. I was distracted. But those…flowers. They wouldn’t happen to be interesting in any way, Miss Solstice?”
“Oh no. Oh no. Not again. Those are my flowers. You stay away from them! They’re mine!”
Erin shot to her feet. Some of her customers looked up, amused. A Gnoll sitting next to them glanced up as she shook a finger at Palt. He raised his hands.
“Miss Solstice! I’m just asking. I have no idea what they are. But…I er, would like to find out.”
She narrowed his eyes at him.
“Because you’re a stoner.”
He had no idea what the word meant—well, he was pretty sure—but she said it like it was an insult. Palt sighed.
“Miss Solstice, there’s nothing dangerous about what I do. I smoke good things.”
“You do drugs! Drugs are bad! Mostly!”
Erin looked uncertain about her own point, but Mrsha was watching. Palt spread his hands.
“Some. But the ones I smoke are usually just good. They make people feel better. And if some people do stronger stuff—well, it’s usually only them it affects. Is there anything wrong in making someone feel good?”
“Well—that’s not the point! I don’t want any in my inn—except for the flowers—and alcohol and—”
Erin hesitated. She looked at Palt.
“Those are my flowers. And dangerous. Actually dangerous, I think.”
“Miss Solstice, I am a [Smoker]. If you’d let me, I’ll take any risk. And I’ll pay you handsomely for the flowers. Beautifully, even.”
Erin stared at Palt as he looked at her, seriously as could be. She raked her hands through her hair. This is not the conversation she wanted! But she had to ask.
“There’s a [Smoker] class? Seriously?”
Palt nodded. He couldn’t take his eyes off the flowers.
“I knew a Lizardgirl, back in Baleros. She could take selpage—that’s a drug, pretty illegal and dangerous—and go for over an hour on one dose. And enhance the effects. Some even use it in battle or…I just smoke. There are some downsides to a few…a lot of the really good—strong ones. Whatever. I know what I thought. Miss Solstice, if I could buy—”
She folded her arms and shook her head.
“Two thousand gold pieces.”
“For one planter box!?”
Palt looked incredulous. Some of the patrons sniggered; they’d heard this before. Erin glared.
“For one bulb. Not the entire flower.”
“What? But that’s—fine.”
Dismayed, Palt realized there was a history here. He let it go, reluctantly, but he was determined to wear her down. If he could have just a few to try—but maybe another day. He turned back to Erin as she sat down.
