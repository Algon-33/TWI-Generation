Joseph laughed. Not that it was crucial to keep Kevin’s stash, but it was…from home. A great comfort. And all that. Kevin nodded, but he was causal about it.
“It doesn’t matter if it gets deleted, Joseph. I bet you there’s some stuff here.”
“What…you mean illustrations?”
“There have to be. Think about it. Our worlds are so similar. They loved soccer. I bet you that if I looked around in Liscor…”
The two began laughing at the ludicrous idea of going out to buy bawdy illustrations in Liscor. They were friends. Well—Kevin got along with everyone.
“Maybe later. I want to play another game around Celum.”
“I bet you’ll get people to play. I’m going to earn money.”
“How?”
Kevin shrugged.
“Lyonette says she’ll pay me to help out. I can do that. Lift stuff, clean tables. It pays less than begging, though. But I’ll put in some hours after this. Also—that Centaur? He’s really cool. Guess what he has?”
Kevin showed Joseph a spliff. The young man from Spain blinked at it.
“That can’t be what I think it is.”
“Yup. This world is really like ours. Just with magic. You should talk to the Centaur. He’s a really chill guy. Apparently he sells dreamleaf, which is even better than weed. According to him. But since we’re friends of Erin and you know—from Earth—he hooked me up.”
“He knows?”
Kevin rolled his eyes. He realized he didn’t have a lighter and sighed.
“Everyone knows. That Goblin dude? Numbtongue? He was playing Journey in the basement.”
“Get out. He looks intense. Have you seen his scars?”
“He’s cool too. I think. I was going to smoke this with him, see if he wants to.”
That was Kevin for you. Joseph shook his head as he finally found the lost football. He checked it, but it was in one piece.
“Think we should walk back? Or use the magic door?”
He glanced back towards the inn. Kevin patted him on the shoulder.
“Tell you what. I’ll use the magic door, you walk back. You need the exercise now you’re playing soccer. We’ll see who gets back first.”
“Asshole.”
And then—the two young men heard a voice.
“You! Yes, you! Stop right there!”
They turned. A very angry Gnoll woman was coming out of Liscor. Kevin winced.
“Uh oh.”
The Watch? That was Joseph’s first thought. That angry Drake Watch Captain probably didn’t appreciate people hitting her walls. But—he didn’t see any armor on this woman.
Nor, he realized, was she alone. He hadn’t seen Ekirra at first because his mother was dragging the little Gnoll behind her. Joseph recognized Ekirra and the mother.
“Oh—can we help you? Hey, Ekirra.”
The Gnoll cub shyly waved at Joseph. But his mother did not. She stopped in front of Joseph.
“You were the one who played that game yesterday, right? Soccer?”
Joseph winced. Kevin grinned.
“It’s called ‘football’. But yes, I—”
“He got a class. [Kicker]! From your game.”
Ekirra’s mother, Jeva Silverfang lifted her son up by one paw. He kicked the air aimlessly as she put him down. Ekirra seemed quite pleased. Jeva on the other hand—folded her arms together.
Kevin and Joseph both eyed her. Neither was the tallest and Jeva was in the average bracket of a Gnoll woman’s height—which was six foot, two inches. Or, as Joseph would have said, around 1.9 meters.
She was also muscular. And she had claws. A predator’s teeth. She could probably trash both of them if she got mad. Joseph gulped.
“Uh—I’m sorry? I didn’t know. I mean—it was just a game. I—”
He looked at Kevin for support, but Kevin was standing tactically behind Joseph. He called out hopefully.
“We’re really sorry about it!”
“Sorry? For what? He got a class!”
