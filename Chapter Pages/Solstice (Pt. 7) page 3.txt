“You will never lose with it. Which does not mean you will not suffer. I am the last Arthur, who releases my burden to Sir Bedivere that he might toss it into the lake.”
He touched at his wounds. Ryoka looked at him. The old Arthur smiled.
“I’m dying. Not a quick death. Long enough for me to order my loyal knight to return what is not mine. You’re going to have to do it three times, by the way.”
“What?”
The younger Arthurs exclaimed at once. The old one rolled his eyes.
“He keeps coming back. But this time is the last. Ere it leaves my hand—that is me.”
He looked at Ryoka. Three Arthurs sat there. She rubbed at her face.
“So you’re the King of Knights. King of Camelot. King of Chivalry and Albion and…that Arthur. Each time you took up or let go of the blade.”
“Exactly. Have you heard of us? Then does the kingdom I must build endure?”
The boy leaned forwards. Ryoka looked at him.
Her mouth worked.
“I don’t understand, though. Why are you here, then?”
“We are all here at once. You see, it is a moment that defines us.”
It was the boy-Arthur who spoke to Ryoka in a lecturing tone. He was as young as he was that day. Ten years old. But Ryoka sensed…
That immortality. That age. He had been here forever. Listening to the other two. He hung his head.
“I confess. I am pondering my fate. It is a terrible decision I must make.”
“As am I.”
“I am not. But I come to tell the other two what may be. Each time. Forever.”
The oldest Arthur nodded at the younger two. Ryoka began to understand.
“So it’s a choice.”
“Exactly.”
The three nodded as one. The youngest pointed to the sword.
“If I draw it, I will become all you say, Miss…what was your name again?”
He blushed.
“Ryoka. Ryoka Griffin.”
“Yes. Miss. You have an odd accent. Were it not for magic, I would never understand you.”
The young King remarked. Ryoka realized that she heard his meaning—but the real language was incomprehensible. Welsh. Old Welsh, perhaps. She rubbed at her ears.
“I’m from the future. Well—a future.”
“Ah. Well, then you know my story. If you know my name. That gives some meaning to my life. I will have to build a kingdom. And get two stupid Dragons to help me fortify the ground of my castle.”
The youngest Arthur was self-satisfied. He looked at the young King. The oldest Arthur grimaced.
“Merlin will settle it. He tends to do most things—until Morgan gets him. You’ll do fine. Well…but for Mordred. And Lancelot. And…”
The other two looked downcast and he began counting off his failures on his hand. Ryoka shuddered.
“I know your history. Are you saying you do?”
The boy nodded gravely.
“I have been told all of it. I will be a great king. Form an order of knights who will do great things. We will save my kingdom to be, and make it great. But I will fail my wife. My friend. My son will be my end. I will die bitterly. All these things I know. So—I am debating whether to pull out the sword.”
He shuddered. Ryoka saw he believed in his fate. He knew what was coming. Still—the young King-Arthur’s face was set. The old one raised a hand.
“Wait a while. You can still wait. If the burden is too much…”
“If not me, then who? My kingdom will fall to ruin if I do not draw the blade.”
“Lancelot. If I knew…”
The three spoke at once, as if going over an old argument. The young king raised a rueful head and looked at Ryoka.
“You see, the instant I throw the broken blade—I will forget this. Only here, do I have the right to know my future and still choose.”
Ryoka Griffin looked from face to face. She stared at the blade.
“I see. So I’ve interrupted that?”
