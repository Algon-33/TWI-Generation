The world went bright. Niers felt his amulet give. He shouted in pain. His shot—hit the adventurer’s shoulder and detonated. The man cried out, but he came on. Niers raised his sword.
And the man stomped on him.
The blow drove Niers into the dead man’s flesh. A crushing impact. He rose—and saw a wand pointing down.
[Fireball]. This time the Fraerling went flying. He landed on the road. Picked himself up. His crossbow—he’d dropped it. He scrambled for his sword.
“There!”
He saw the [Mage] running at him. No, no—
It was just a kick. That was all you needed to do. When he was a boy—the greatest Fraerling [Warrior] of their time, over Level 40—
Had died when someone stomped on him.
They were strong for their size. The Titan’s amulet flashed.
The [Mage] screamed. The blow had shattered two toes. Niers’ amulet went dead. The Titan was still thrown through the air. He landed.
“—damn it.”
Unfair. He was still holding his sword. It was so hard to fight the tall alone. The captain was running at him. Niers reached for his tonic.
His hand didn’t find his bag of holding. He looked around. Where—
His belt was torn apart by the spells and impacts. The Titan stared about him.
“….Get out before we end up like the very same people we defeated.”
The captain kicked him again. Niers tried to stab. He felt his sword pierce the man’s toe before he was hurled through the air. This time—he felt every part of the blow.
He landed on his back. Blood in his mouth. His ribs felt—his leather armor had saved his life. He lay there.
“—dead? Get up! It’s just a broken toe!”
“They’re all dead! All—”
“I’ll kill him.”
The adventurers looked at the tiny figure. He was pulling himself up. The captain raised his spiked mace, sneering.
“Not so tough without your gear, eh, you little shit?”
“You pathetic little Human.”
The Titan’s voice rasped as he stood. He had only his shortsword. No gear. But his Skills burned. He beckoned.
“Come over here and die, adventurer. You think you can kill me?”
He flicked his sword up. The little Fraerling cut the air as the two Humans stared. And his voice was louder. A shout.
“My sword will slay the skies! The tall fall harder! Tallguard of the Fraer!”
A young Fraerling’s boast. The Tallguard’s motto. Niers beckoned.
And the Human adventurer—wavered. The tiny little man wanted him to come close. All he had to do was get a handhold. Then he was climbing a mountain of flesh and bone.
“Blast him.”
He muttered to the [Mage]. The man hesitated. He lifted his staff.
“Coward.”
Niers spat. He pointed at the [Mage].
The magic died. The [Mage] stared at his staff in horror. The Titan exhaled. That was a Skill meant for a damn army. What a waste.
“He just killed our artifacts. Boss—he just killed—I can’t feel magic—”
“Well, we’ll fucking step on him! You go left, I’ll go—”
The two Gold-rank adventurers circled him. The Titan checked his sword. He spat blood. Then he laughed. They flinched as they charged.
“Let us never grow old!”

“We have a list of targets. Let’s just hit one—and—”
The [Ambush Captain] was nervous as the Hectval elites moved towards the city. They were looking for anything to hit.
Something was wrong. They were in range of the other three groups. But one squad’s transmission had cut off and they were not responding.
“4th Squad to 3rd Squad. Report!”
The [Ambush Captain] shouted into his Skill. He had no fear of the words being heard—and yet no one replied.
“2nd Squad, what happened to 3rd? They were headed around the city from the east approach—going to attack that farmstead. Where are they?”
