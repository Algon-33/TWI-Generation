They nodded back. Ser Vorn turned his warhorse. One enemy stood out to him among the rest. A true Demon. He fought on foot, but he was no mere [Soldier]. His glaive spun as he slashed and attacked, cutting down the irregular soldiers before they could even go near him.
The Dwarf [Stone Lieutenant] went down, his armor torn. Ser Vorn nodded.
“Enchanted blade. Don’t try to block it. On me. Sortieing.”
He charged. The remaining six [Knights] on horseback charged with him. A screen of Demons flung themselves forwards. Ser Vorn saw them coming—
“Gorgons!”
A hissing-scream. Ser Vorn saw the flash. His horse stumbled—but the Gorgons slowed the charging Demons. The [Knights] thundered past. Ser Vorn saw Uxel. He lifted one hand. Then gripped the spear tightly.
The Demon Commander saw the [Knights] coming. He set himself, face behind the helmet composed. Not fearless, but a master of fear.
A worthy foe. Ser Vorn leveled his spear. The first [Knight] shouted.
“[Extended L—]”
The Demon cut the air. The snap of the blade of wind hit the [Knight] in the chest. Her armor took the blow, but she reeled. The Demon moved sideways. Ser Vorn saw a flicker—
“Dodge!”
Two [Knights] went down. The glaive cut through their armor as the Demon blurred. Ser Vorn struck.
[Extended Strike]. [Hammer’s Blow].
The Demon blocked it. With the shaft of his glaive, somehow, spinning the weapon. But the impact threw him back.
A second [Knight] brought down a greatsword. The Demon pirouetted. Grace—he caught the blow again on his glaive. A superior enchantment. He swung as the [Knight] passed.
A third one died. Ser Vorn maneuvered. Turning for a second charge. Four [Knights] left. He heard a voice.
“Until my dying breath, from sea to glorious sea—”
Charge again. This time a lance and two spears struck from all sides. The Demon knocked one down; his glaive flashed impossibly fast. A lance was struck, and the rider reeled from broken armor. Ser Vorn saw the glaive spinning his way—
“Vorn!”
A bellowing voice. The Gorgon hurled his scimitar.
[Hurricane Throw]. The Demon [Champion] tried to dodge. The [Knight] thrust his spear. He struck enchanted armor—shouted.
“[Hydra’s Strikes]!”
His spear blurred. The Demon stumbled backwards. Eight wounds bled. Ser Vorn thundered past him as the Demon stumbled.
“Poison.”
Ser Vorn swore he heard the Demon muttering. He should have died before Ser Vorn turned amid the fighting. But today was full of disappointments. The Demon stumbled upright.
“You should be dead, sir.”
The [Knight] lifted his spear. The other [Knights] were separated in the fighting. The Demon’s face was pale in his helmet.
“[Purified Flesh]. Few poisons in this world can even harm me.”
“Drathians.”
A voice spat. Uxel slithered out of the fighting, his armor torn. The Demon [Commander] turned. The Gorgon drew a backup scimitar. Ser Vorn lowered his spear, aiming for the enemy’s chest. The Demon looked at him.
“It is dishonorable to fight two on one, [Knight].”
“I am aware.”
The two commanders charged. The Demon’s glaive spun. Ser Vorn saw Uxel deflect a blow. He stabbed again.
Deeper. The Demon was slowed. The spear sought his heart. The Demon staggered, backing up. Ser Vorn passed him. Turned—
“Bazeth!”
A young woman’s scream. The Demon looked up. Ser Vorn turned. He saw Uxel slashing down—
Crack. It was like thunder. The Gorgon recoiled. His scales opened up. Something had struck him in the shoulder. Ser Vorn’s head turned. He grabbed his shield—
