A period of space shorter than a second in time. A moment. As immortal as the death coming for both of them. Tritel, short, stocky, a [Hostler] who had become a Courier, looked down at his mare, his friend.
Ci, the Moonlight Horse. Sinking. As perfect as he was not. The Moonlight Rider—spoke. One last Skill.
“[One Dies Before The Other]. I’m sorry, Ci.”
Salamani, trying to rise, heard the Courier’s voice. He looked up.
Blood on the ground. Someone rose on shaky legs.
Ci. The horse snorted, amazed. Then looked around for her friend. He was lying there. A smile on his face. The kind of Skill you saved for the end.

So she ran. And they both had that thought.
They might have been friends. For a moment, they had liked each other. Now? They hated each other more than anything else.
“Stop.”
Ryoka did not. Ferin took aim. This time, he did not miss.
The first bolt went through her shoulder and out the other side. She stumbled, but kept going. The armor-piercing bolt was too powerful. Ryoka’s body didn’t even slow it. Cursing, the [Trapmaster] reloaded.
She was running faster than she ever had. Without magic. Without the wind. But still faster, her form perfect. But she was just Human.
He shot her through the lower back, just missing the spine. This time she fell. But she got back up.
“Stop.”
As if there were any point for either of them? He reloaded. Fired again.
Artery. Her leg was pinned. She kept moving.
Even if I crawl. The [Assassin] reached for the final bolt. He aimed at her from afar. Then, he adjusted his aim.
Fired. The bolt flew through the air, a deadly missile. But of course—the [Lord] knocked it out of the air.
How far were they from their destination? It didn’t matter anymore. The Couriers, the wind—
Salamani the [Mage] Runner had finished his delivery first. And it was just words. Coordinates.
Lord Tyrion Veltras rode towards the [Assassin]. Ryoka Griffin didn’t even see him. She was crawling, thinking the last bolt was coming for her.
Ferin could have shot her. But for a moment, he’d been flawed. An imperfect weapon.
He’d wanted to live. What a blunder.
He had left his wires behind. The [Assassin] drew a long dagger, slowly. The lance—he called out as the [Lord] rode at him.

The Banner of House Veltras flew in the winds. Jericha held it aloft as she surged behind Lord Tyrion. Behind her lay chaos and bloodshed. But only on one side.

“The House of Veltras has mobilized its army. They’ve killed every agent around the manor! All of them in a hundred miles!”
The Circle of Thorns listened. They felt the winds shift.

Ullim stood with a sword bared, over the two young [Lords]. He looked towards the window, watchful.
“Hurry, my lord.”

Ryoka Griffin was trying to run. Then crawl. She didn’t stop. She pulled herself forwards—until she met a foot.
A metal boot, rather. Since it was an aberration, she stopped.
“Take—take it to House Veltras. Lord Tyrion.”
She mumbled. Someone knelt.
“I am Lord Tyrion Veltras.”
Ryoka tried to raise her head. She saw the outline of a stern face. Felt cold liquid on her back, amid the void of emptiness. She feared…the man’s face changed.
“Delivery. Delivery for Lord Veltras. Do you have a seal?”
The Wind Runner giggled. The [Lord] knelt. Beyond him, a figure wrapped in dark clothing waited. An army was coming down the road. But for a moment, he spoke and listened.
“What is your name, Courier?”
“Just Runner. City Runner.”
“Then—what is it?”
He knew. But she gasped it anyways.
“Ryoka Griffin.”
