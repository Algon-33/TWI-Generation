“Nah, nah. That’s this one. I’m not opening it unless the workers and adventurers are here. I’m not stupid. This one’s…oh, I lost the red stone. The door to the Cave Goblin’s cave. See?”
She pointed to the door, opening and closing it absently. Nothing happened. Lyonette yawned.
“Well, stop it. I don’t care what you feel. No one wants in.”
“But I thought…aw, never mind.”
Erin wandered away from the door. After a while, the feeling vanished. The [Innkeeper] shrugged.
“Probably just my imagination. I’ve gotta upgrade that door.”
“How?”
“Um. Palt?”
“Hah.”
They went back to sleep. Erin Solstice stared at the door, and remembered a little Goblin.
“I hope you’re safe, Pebblesnatch. I hope…”
She turned away, shaking her head. Erin expected to feel the hollow pain, the wrenching guilt and…but it didn’t come. She stared blankly at the door. Touched her chest. It was probably just her imagination.
“Stay safe, little Pebblesnatch.”
Far away, a Cave Goblin rolled over and dreamed cooking dreams.
