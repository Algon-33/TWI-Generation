Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

“I don’t have to get them all. The Gnoll child is ‘kidnap’. The Human? You can arrange her death if I can’t grab her. I even know where she plays. So listen. When I give the signal…”
She was growling at Mr. Soot. And he was seeing his tenure as a gang leader in Liscor reaching its end. Because if they went after Erin Solstice, who had ties to Liscor’s new Council—if they went after Mrsha, or stole the magic door that was making Liscor so famous? Zevara would have his head.
“Bearclaw, can’t we wait? Let’s look for an opportunity…”
Mr. Soot saw the Gnoll woman’s eyes narrow. As if she could see his second thoughts. But she only smiled then, hugely, with all her teeth. She reached out and grabbed his shoulder. Soot felt the bodyguards stir, but he signaled them with his tail. He was holding his concealed wand very tightly as Bearclaw leaned in. He could smell her last meal—meat.
“Soot, you and I are partners. We do this and I’ll cut you in on the profits. Who needs Liscor after this? You can set up in another city, and live like a [Prince] off the money. We’re not going to risk anything. It’s a nice mission—”
“Mr. Soot. A [Message]. Big news from the Invisibles.”
The Gnoll woman broke off. Mr. Soot looked up, grateful for the reprieve. One of his assistants was staring wide-eyed at a [Message] scroll.
“They’re putting out a…big offer. They want anyone connected with the Golden Triangle taken out. And they have a list. Ancestors.”
“What is it?”
The Gnoll woman saw Mr. Soot reaching for the scroll. He blinked, swore, and then showed it to her.
“The Academy—a faction of them deals with us, Bearclaw. They’re offering lots of money to take out these targets.”
There were only four names for Liscor. But one of them made Mr. Soot just shake his head.
“They must not know the levels of their targets. We can do the other three…but that one?”
Senior Guardsman Relc Grasstongue. Bearclaw’s eyes widened. She looked up—then she smiled.
“Why not?”
Mr. Soot and the others froze. One of them began.
“He’s a Senior Guardsman—”
Then he remembered who Bearclaw had killed. The Gnoll fell silent. Bearclaw looked at Mr. Soot.
“I remember him. Big Drake. Spear?”
“A [Spearmaster]. Bearclaw, he’s the Watch’s finest. It wouldn’t be wise to—”
Mr. Soot saw the dangerous look in Bearclaw’s eyes. He paused. And then—something went off in his head. The [Mastermind] steepled his claws and gave her a worried look.
“It wouldn’t be wise to tangle with him. Not worth the effort. He could hurt even you—”
“You think he could beat me? Me?”
The Gnoll snarled. Mr. Soot suppressed an inner smile.
“I didn’t say that! I just said—”
“I remember him. Him and that Ant-monster. He challenged me. And the Ant-thing’s gone, right?”
Bearclaw checked the reward again. But the number didn’t matter. She was smiling, now.
“Change of plans. Soot, I’ll send my people after the other targets. But this? I’ll do this for fun.”
She waved the contract at Soot. The Drake hesitated. The other targets.
“Shouldn’t we wait for—?”
And then he realized he’d made a mistake. Because Bearclaw put one huge paw on his shoulder.
“No, Soot. We’re doing this together. Just in case you have any doubts. You’re going to wait right here while this all goes down. So if we fail—we do it together. The door, the Gnoll, the Human. And this Relc. I want them all.”
She smiled hugely. And Soot cursed. Because Bearclaw was insane. But he also couldn’t run. She was holding his shoulder. So when you were this deep in the water and air was running out—you kept diving. Hoping there was a pocket of air below.
