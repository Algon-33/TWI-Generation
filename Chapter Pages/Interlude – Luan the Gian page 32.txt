Interlude – Luan the Gian
Page 32
It wasn’t a good moment. Luan’s head had been just peeking out, like some giant of nightmares. But that wouldn’t have terrified Fraerlings normally—Ekrn swore.
“That’s—”
The Guidance seized him, shaking him.
“Did you do this? Traitor! Was it Paeth? I can’t believe it!”
“Do what? Do…”
And then they realized. The Guidance pointed at Luan.
“They did this. It was an army of them. Tallfolk. They’re coming.”
The Giant of Paeth looked at the terrified Fraerlings amid the chaos. He looked as Ekrn and Noa turned back to him, in a horror reflected on their faces. There would be no celebration, not now.
The Tallfolk had destroyed a Fraerling village. They were hunting the small. Why? For what reason? Luan didn’t know. He couldn’t know. After all, he was cut off from the world. In the chaos, as Ekrn established that there was no way Luan could have treacherously revealed the location of a Fraerling village, not under watch, the truth came out. The news so delayed, that changed it all.
The Titan of Baleros was missing. The Forgotten Wing Company was under attack.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I’m tired. I often am, but I’m trying to fix a bad sleep schedule and busy…so it’s shorter chapters. As in, sub 20k, if you can believe that.
I hope you still liked it! This is the side story chapter…in a sense, half the story unfolding at the moment. The other half is the United Nations company perspective, Foliana’s…well, it’s one big story. I’ll probably tell it soon, but there are other places! Oh, so many plotlines, but that’s good and bad.
Hope you enjoy. I’ll get more rest and be back strong next chapter! Thanks for reading! By the way, the edited chapter is coming up, with Diana Gill soon…I’ll let you know when it’s happening. Expect big things. Or small things, which are just as good. Thanks for reading!
