Solstice (Pt. 2)

“By the will of the fates, I beg your aid! This boon must come to pass.”
The sound that struck the air was like a bell—or something shattering—a distant roll of thunder—all these things at once. Ryoka’s ears rang and everyone covered their ears.
She expected the first of the Summer Court to rage. To strike at her. To fix her with those terrible, glorious eyes. But he did none of those things.
Melidore sighed. And the sound was like summer passing to fall.
“You know too much, mortal. And you invoke the old ways at your peril. Since you force me; I will listen. I must acknowledge the three. So. What is your threefold boon?”
He looked at her. Unfriendly. But listening nonetheless. Ryoka took a breath, and she felt like she hadn’t since she first spoke the boon.
“Th-three things. I ask.”
“That is how the threefold boon works. Ask.”
He glowered at her. Ryoka nodded slowly.
“I ask for a way to bring my friend back from between life and death.”
Murmurs. Lady Ieka’s eyes widened. Halrac—Ylawes—heads rose across the gathering. Lord Tyrion Veltras dropped his goblet. If—
But it was only Ryoka who could ask. Everyone else was transfixed. More than spellbound. Ryoka went on.
“I ask for passage into your land.”
Narrowed eyes. Melidore whirled upon Silver Pines. The tree met his gaze, unmoving. He had told Ryoka what she needed.
To meet Ivolethe. To find the cure—Ryoka pointed at Melidore as he turned.
“I ask for the chance to meet with my friend, if she wishes to do the same!”
She felt the air twist. All three boons hung in the air, so real she could feel her words. Passage, aid, and a meeting.
They fit. Oh yes. The Summer Court, who had been so disappointed with her gifts, objected not at all now.
This was a boon worthy of them. All eyes turned to Melidore.
He could refuse, of course. But she had invoked more than just his personal feelings. She had involved the Faerie King, if not by name. Their honor.
Prophecy. And the fae knew it. He stared at her, greatly displeased. Then he shook his head.
“Ah, mortal girl. Windfriend. Favored of the Winter Court. You are a foolish one. You ask three where most would not dare one. You ask for gifts far beyond what you could ever give or pay for. And you would overturn the will of the King of the Fae.”
“I would.”
Ryoka was trembling. Melidore smirked; and it was unkind. He looked around, then raised one more finger.
“Since I am bound by the old ways. I say one more thing. You have reason. You have…right.”
His eyes narrowed.
“But you do not have my consent. And I will fight your boon to the last. So. Persuade me. Give me one more reason.”
Faeries! Ryoka bit her tongue so hard she cut herself. But she felt him giving. He was sweating, trying to deny the threefold boon. Anyone else surely would have caved. She searched for a fourth reason worthy of the rest. And she had nothing. No Dragon. No Erin. She was only Ryoka Griffin.
A failure who…Ryoka’s eyes opened. She stared at Melidore and then looked around. She took a breath—
“A fourth reason? Very well. Because…”
The fae leaned forwards. Ryoka stared Melidore straight in his eyes.
“…it will probably be very entertaining.”
The fae’s eyes widened. His cheeks bulged. He tried to hold it in. But the laugh escaped him. And the Summer Court guffawed and rolled in mirth. They laughed and laughed.
Ruefully, Melidore raised his hand. He shook his head.
“Very well. Very well!”
The laughter ceased. He looked at Ryoka, annoyed, impressed, amused, all at once.
