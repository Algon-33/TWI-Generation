Potion, meet back. Back…so that’s what it’s supposed to look like. I giggle and turn back to the Blighted King. And the map.
“Let me see. There’s a clear corridor here, an empty one here…and I just cleared that one.”
I trace a line down the map. The Blighted King stares at me.
“Do you have what is needed to complete this plan you refuse to speak of?”
“Just a minute, needy! I think…yes! Now I just need some things from you, my good pal Nereshal here, and…the Fool.”
I glance sideways. The banquet hall has been transformed. Tables have been upended, places made ready for people too wounded to fight to rest, and guards are standing at all the entrances. But hey, some things never change.
The Fool’s face has definitely changed. I think someone stepped on it. Or kicked it. Repeatedly. Princess Erille is standing in front of him, tears in her eyes, trying to defend him from further abuse. Touching. I grin and walk over to her.
“Stand back.”
Isodore pushes past me. She drags Erille away; the girl kicks at her, fighting, shouting for the Fool. I bend down. The Fool barely looks at me. He’s still under a spell. I think he can’t move.
“Hey buddy. Want to go for a walk?”
“I must know what you intend.”
The Blighted King stares at me as I drag the Fool with me. Nereshal has a wand in his hand. He looks so grim! I shrug.
“I’m going to do the hostage negotiations thing.”
“With the Fool?”
The Blighted King looks incredulous.
“Just wait and see! Nereshal thinks it’ll work, don’t you, buddy?”
The mage glares at me, but nods.
“I am aware of what he wants. I believe it may work, your majesty. I will teleport myself back in case of trouble. But we are running out of time.”
The King stares at me and his mage. He nods shortly.
“Go, then.”
He stares at the Fool. The Fool glares back. I sigh.
“Get a room, you two.”
They stare at me. I scowl.
“What? It’s hard to be funny. You want to make a better joke? You try coming up with it on the spot.”
“What do you call a King who slaughters his own people?”
The Fool mutters, spitting blood. Nereshal hits him. I grin.
“Not bad.”

“This way. Down this corridor, left here…you know, this would be a lot easier if I didn’t have to drag you.”
“I know.”
The Fool and I move down the corridors I’ve cleared, me pushing and carrying him. He seems determined not to move. Not that he can. Paralysis spell or something Nereshal used on him. I laugh.
“I wonder where Nereshal went? I guess he’s busy killing Demons. He’s cool like that.”
“There is nothing noble about it. There is nothing about this war that’s worth admiring.”
The Fool mumbles around swollen lips. I laugh at him. I do that a lot.
“What, you think the Demons are right? Is that why you did all this?”
The Fool is silent. I round a corridor. Now, was it left, or right? Wait a second, up. I drag him up the stairs. He speaks as I reach the top.
“The Demons are willing to kill for their survival. I don’t think they’re right. But they aren’t wrong either. They fight to live. While the Blighted King—do you know what he has done? All the horrors he has committed in the name of defeating the Demons?”
“Nope. Want to tell me? I could take notes.”
The Fool glares at me as I drag him by his feet down an empty corridor. You know, for variety.
“Why didn’t you walk away? If you had, I could have gotten Erille to safety, and Isodore! Now they’ll both die, more likely than not. You’re on the wrong side, Tom.”
“Side? Side?”
I kick him. The Fool groans through gritted teeth. I pick him up by the feet and glare at his knees.
