Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 3
And the [Knights] stirred. They looked ready to fight again, even the ones who’d just surrendered. One of the officers, a [Captain], raised a hand.
“[Knight]’s honor and stuff. Leave it.”
He was familiar with Terandria’s knight-orders and their touchy pride. If it meant not having to beat the armored people into a pulp a second time…the [Soldier] shrugged and got three of his friends to help drag the unconscious figure into a tent.
This was the scene. This was the moment. The Order of Seasons’ [Knights] found their wounds bandaged—broken bones set, rather than tended to with a healing potion, to make their escape harder. They were glum.
From the ship battle at sea with the Ailendamus fleet, to their escape attempt on land as they’d disembarked to the coast, to this. At least they would be ransomed. Their names would be taken, their families and their Order contacted for a hefty sum, and they’d be allowed to go free.
That was how it worked. Someone would remove Ser Solstice’s helm eventually. A small infraction, but they were [Knights]. Common [Soldiers] would not get this luxury.
Talia would be incensed, with her defeat as well as their failure to join the Dawn Concordat and disgracing her Order when she woke.
Ser Solstice…the Goblin Slayer…and as he was called by his friends, Rabbiteater, would awake to the news of his inevitable ransoming and know it was his death. He had had one chance. Only the ‘knightly vow’ he’d taken had saved him. But when they asked his name, checked his identity?
He should never have surrendered. He should never have come here.
The Goblin sat, dizzy and sick. Waiting for the truth to will out.

The naval landing party approached the [General]’s tent. The flag of Ailendamus and his personal crest—a bear’s paw—was flying. The sight of the twined lances like arrows made the [First Mate] reflexively salute—then he knocked on the tent.
“[General]?”
The man was inside, pouring himself a drink of wine. There were a lot of things to say.
Firstly, that he hadn’t removed the armor of the prisoners. Second, the fact that the man ran a clearly lax camp—not much military discipline? Third? Drinking by day?
But the [First Mate] was no [Captain] of Ailendamus. And while they were on the same side, the sight of the huge man beating [Knights] down with his bare fists checked any rebuke from the navy’s representative.
“General Yerzhen, isn’t it? I’ve come at the behest of Bombard-Captain Legoris, of The Narwhal’s Bow to confirm you have possession of the prisoners. The escape attempt was ah—”
“Who’re you?”
General Yerzhen looked up after a moment, and the [First Mate] realized not a single word had been heard. Yerzhen rubbed at his head once.
“Damn helmets. That last bastard had a thick one. Must’ve been a Skill or good steel. Who’re you? Ah, navy idiot, aren’t you? Yeah, we have the prisoners. Sod off.”
That level of disrespect was too much, even for the [First Mate]. He straightened.
“General, I am the [First Mate] of—”
“Piss. Off. We’ll ransom them. Hey!”
He bellowed and one of his officers came running. Yerzhen offered the man a cup of wine—which was accepted—and talked while downing one himself.
“Get the [Knights] ransomed by tonight. Go to the Order of Seasons and get—what is it? Two hundred gold a head? Four hundred? They don’t want to do it? Families. Then we’ll just toss ‘em in one of the prison trains otherwise.”
“Got it, [General].”
Yerzhen turned to the [First Mate].
“There. Happy?”
