“I would pay much for it, yes.”
“Okay, then. Listen close.”
Both adventurers leaned in. Erin whispered.
“It’s bone.”
Regrika blinked.
“By bone, do you mean meat off the bone—”
“No, I mean, it’s bone. You ate bones of dead animals. There was no meat in that. Not one bit.”
Both Gnoll and Drake looked at Erin. She took a step back and pointed at their plates. Her smile was still on her face, but it had changed.
“You want to know what that was? It was bones, dried and ground up into dust. And other bones soaked in pig’s blood from Octavia’s shop and mixed with mana potions. I baked it together using marrow as glue. Then I dyed it with more blood. It looks only a little bit like a steak. No one else would ever eat it. No one except you two.”
Regrika stared at Erin. The hairs on her body began to rise. Erin continued. She had a very big smile on her face.
“And I put poison in it. Bad poison. The kind that can kill Shield Spiders. I got it from Octavia. I put in a lot. Funny. It didn’t seem to matter if I did. I knew you’d like it.”
“I don’t understand. Is this some kind of joke…?”
Ikriss tried to laugh. Erin turned to him. Her smile had become wide. Her eyes were bright.
“No. I didn’t expect you to actually eat my food. But you did. You ate it and didn’t notice a thing. You thought it was steak because it was red and shaped like it. That’s not normal.”
“Well, I—”
“And another thing. You didn’t like any of my other dishes. I could tell. You didn’t like drinking beer, and you didn’t like the cake. Not one bit. And you lied about that. I guess that’s normal. Everyone’s got different tastes and all, but then I got to thinking. Hey Regrika, you’re a really weird Gnoll, you know that?”
“Really? I think I’m quite normal, yes?”
Regrika bared her teeth. Erin did the same.
“No. I mean, you smell like a Gnoll and you act like one. And all the Gnolls love you, but guess what I noticed? It was a little thing. You never really mentioned Mrsha. Not once.”
Ikriss glanced swiftly at his companion. Regrika hesitated and then appeared indifferent.
“Mrsha? Oh. The little Gnoll cub. She was very cute. What about her?”
“You think she’s normal, don’t you?”
The Named Adventurer paused.
“No. But I did not mention her because it would have been rude. A Gnoll cub being raised by a Human is strange. However—”
“You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?”
Erin stared at Regrika. Ikriss’ eyes widened. He hissed at Regrika.
“The white fur!”
“That’s right.”
Erin stepped back from the table. Her eyes were on Regrika. The Gnoll stared back, no longer smiling.
“White fur. That’s bad…luck? I don’t know. But I know that every Gnoll knows what it means, even if they won’t tell me. Every Gnoll. Ishkr was born in Liscor and he still knows about white fur. But you, you didn’t bat an eyelash. You asked whose kid Mrsha was.”
Silence. Regrika shifted in her seat. She looked around and suddenly saw a different room. The Gold-rank adventurers from Griffon Hunt were standing up at their table, adjusting their belts, nodding at each other and spreading out. On the opposite side of the room, the Halfseekers were already in position. Jelaqua lifted her two-handed flail, not trying to hide it.
“You don’t like normal food. You lied about killing Brunkr. And you don’t know about white Gnolls like Mrsha, which every Gnoll knows about.”
Erin’s voice was hard and loud. She was walking backwards, back behind a table where two Drakes were getting to their feet. Zel and Ilvriss walked forwards. A sword was in the Wall Lord’s hands. Zel’s claws were open.
“I see. We were discovered.”
