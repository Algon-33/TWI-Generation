Hah. Ulvama rolled her eyes. But he wasn’t, so she would have knifed him twice if she’d been trying to kill him. [Mages]. She backed up.
“Not hungry. Am fine. Sorry Goblin. Is go now.”
She began to scuttle out of the kitchen. Then…stopped. Ulvama ground her teeth. She had to know. She looked over her shoulder and pointed at the door.
“Broken Goblin with sword. He not eat?”
“Broken…Numbtongue? No…he hasn’t.”
Imani looked at Ulvama, and then at Palt.
“I tried to give him food, but—well, I think the plate’s still up there. It’s not like it’s gone bad, but he hasn’t touched it.”
“You…give food to him?”
Ulvama was surprised. Imani nodded, with something like actual concern. Blown away, Ulvama saw Palt nod.
“I could try to talk to him again…but I don’t think it’ll work.”
He half-trotted into the door. Ulvama’s eyes narrowed.
“How do that, you?”
Imani’s forehead wrinkled. Ulvama might have been overdoing the bad speaking. But most Goblins spoke like this. Mountain City tribe was different.
“We…we can go through the garden. Oh. You can’t. Erin’s Skill—”
She and Palt shared a look. That was the frozen Human’s name. Erin. Ulvama hesitated, eying the Centaur.
“I go through? I am Goblin. He is Goblin. I talk to.”
She smiled, trying to look unthreatening as possible. She shouldn’t have shown them she could blend with the walls. Palt hesitated.
“I don’t know. We can’t just bring new people in.”
“They came for the wake. I guess the door’s not letting anyone through? We could…bring her in? I don’t know how, though.”
Ulvama’s smile turned to a scowl as Imani’s back turned. Darn. She thought for a second, but the Garden didn’t actually have much of what she wanted. Just that Sage’s Grass on the hill; Ulvama would love to cut a bunch of the plants. And truth be told…
Goblins could live for up to a week without food. Twice as much if they had the right classes. Tremborag could probably have starved for a month. But without water? She hesitated. But that stupid broken Goblin…
“You give him food. Numbtongue. He eat. Food, water.”
She urged Imani. The [Cook] looked helpless.
“But he won’t eat.”
Ulvama eyed her.
“So? Make him Hungry Hungry Stew.”
“Hungry Hungry…what?”
Did she not know what that was? Ulvama tried to translate.
“Make him stew…with Skill. That makes him very hungry. So even sad Goblins have to eat. You have Skill?”
She looked at Imani hopefully. The [Cook] blankly looked at Palt. He shrugged.
“Must be a compulsion-effect. I don’t know it. I could cast a spell on a dish. But do you know that Skill, Imani?”
“No…”
Ulvama cursed. Most Goblins got that Skill. It’s utility wasn’t just in making sad Goblins eat. It was generally to uh, make Goblins so hungry they ate stews with worms and mud and bark in them without objecting to the taste.
What other ways did you cheer up sad Goblin warriors? Well…she thought Imani and the Centaur would object if she told her to go have sex with the broken Goblin. Getting a Chieftain to kick the sad Goblins into action and go kill something didn’t work either since there was no Chieftain.
“I go into Garden, I help.”
Imani hesitated.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t know how to do it.”
“Human poo.”
Ulvama cursed. She leaned on her staff. Then she had an idea.
“I know how to make broken Goblin eat. You have water? Food?”
“There’s a plate. But I could get um—a regular stew.”
