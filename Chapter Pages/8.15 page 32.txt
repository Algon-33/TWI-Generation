The broadcast was filled with excited [Mages], interesting sights—far overshadowing the poorer submissions.
Which were, to their respective disappointments, the Order of Seasons and Nsiia, both of whom couldn’t match the excitement of the best submissions.
Into this moment strode Eldavin. The lesser [Mages] parted like a swarm in front of the half-Elf. He looked around.
“What are you all doing?”
The [Mages] looked at the upset Dragon. They hesitated.
“Grand Magus? Is something the matter?”
“I should say so! I am seeing this display of ability from every corner of the world! Yet where are the [Mages]? Where is Wistram’s pride?”
The half-Elf stared about. A few jaws dropped.
“You mean—but we’re not [Warriors], Grand Magus. And this has been a decidedly, er, physical event.”
One of the [Mages] blustered, and then recalled he was talking to Eldavin, who looked like a Grimalkin of half-Elves. He was fixed with a stare by Eldavin that was practically a [Frostbite] spell of its own.
“Young mage. Tell me something. Is there anything that can be done that Dr—[Mages] cannot do better?”
The arrogance of…[Mages]. The group of spellcasters looked at each other. Eldavin sniffed.
“That’s what I thought. Put us ‘on air’ in fifteen minutes. Anyone wishing to join me is free to participate. Students, teachers—I think outside the academy will do.”
He pointed at the Archmages.

Rabbiteater sat on the grass, sipping from his water flask with the handy straw. The other [Knights] of the Order of Seasons sat around glumly.
No featuring for them. Greysten was complaining to the Fall’s Sentinel, who was personally talking to [Mages] in Wistram.
“No luck, I’m afraid. Look—Wistram is next.”
“That’s sheer favoritism—”
The Summer’s Champion hesitated. For there, on screen, was Grand Magus Eldavin and nearly a hundred [Mages], students and older, demonstrating the art of grandstanding.
“Now, how does the expression go? Ah, yes. Pass the ball.”
Eldavin gestured. Then, with a good show of it, the white-haired half-Elf with the beard who looked like he was pushing two hundred casually kicked the [Fireball] left. The [High Mage] turned dead white, but she fielded the ball, and kicked it ahead.
The [Mages] were running too, incidentally. On…Rabbiteater blinked.
The surface of the ocean, around the Academy of [Mages]. One of the [Mages] passed the ball up towards someone else running on a [Light Bridge] spell. Eldavin harrumphed. He caught the eye of the ‘camera’ and closed one eye, smiling rather arrogantly.
“Just a bit of magical finesse. Even [Mages] must indulge in such things. Keep running, students! [Tidal Wave]!”
He pointed to some lagging students and an obliging wave swallowed them. Ahead of Eldavin, the [Mages] were vying for the ‘ball’, throwing it around with telekinesis, laughing—and showing off of course.
“I believe that would be the spectacle to beat.”
The Fall’s Champion remarked drily. Greysten threw his hands up in exasperation.
“[Mages]!”

“This is too bloody amazing. Someone get me a [Teleportation] spell.”
Daly looked around as the [Mages] came onto the scrying orb. Ironically, the United Nations company and the Earthers there weren’t as excited as other groups across the world.
Mainly because Luan was missing. Even Daly was trying to force the mood a bit. He looked about, and then dropped it. Paige was looking at the orb, grimly tuning a crossbow.
Luan was gone. Probably…dead. There was no body, but the [Bounty Hunters] had been arrested once it had been clear they’d hit him with a [Fireball] at sea.
