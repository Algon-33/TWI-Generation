None of Nerrhavia’s warriors made a sound after that. The two armies withdrew further in silence. Mars, who remained, stared across the vast distance and leaned on the horse she’d borrowed. She heard nothing from the other army for a long time. They could have laughed. They could have jeered or taunted him. Her [King]. But if they had, neither she nor they were certain he wouldn’t have charged. He probably wouldn’t. But the world still watched.
“Remember that, you arrogant silk handkerchiefs.”
Mars spat in the dust. But she turned. He wouldn’t have charged. Her [King] had made up his mind. He just hated it.

Tiqr was falling. And now, Erin could see it. Almost. In the dry, factual sentences, an entire empire breaking apart. People fleeing. An army reeling from—what? Defeat? No, just breaking under too many casualties. Giving ground. Pulling back. The citizens fleeing.
“Tiqr’s alliance with the local [Druid] factions collapses. Mass exodus west towards the Killale Steppes.”
Mrsha looked up at Erin. She was sitting on Erin’s lap, now. Watching Erin and Pisces’ faces more than understanding the abstract concepts. Erin looked at Pisces.
“I didn’t know they had [Druids]. Aren’t they solitary?”
“Some. But Tiqr is a place of animals. Why wouldn’t they have [Druids]?”
“They left yesterday. When I was at Esthelm.”
“Yes.”

Empress Nsiia sat on her throne. She had not eaten. She had not moved. General Vasraf had taken to the front, to lead a retreat. She didn’t rise as the congregations of [Druids] entered the throne room. Nor when they told her she was leaving.
Thef was dead. Slain. Alked Fellbow, the Named Adventurer, had brought him down. Nsiia only moved once. And it was to look up. Wildkeeper Jvaile looked at her. The woman was a [Druid]. First of her circle.
“You are leaving.”
“Yes, Empress. We cannot remain. Half our circle has perished in this war. We have given all we can. No more. We are leaving.”
The Wildkeeper bowed. The other [Druids] knelt. Nsiia looked at her. Her throat worked; she coughed. Dry from lack of water. A servant hurried forwards and she drank from the bowl. She coughed again.
“Where?”
“The Killale Steppes. The Garuda tribes will allow our presence. Further still, perhaps. Empress. We beg your pardon—”
“Good. Take my people with you.”
Nsiia saw the Wildkeeper looked up. The Empress of Beasts moved. She looked out of her throne room.
“The herds too. The young. The elephants. All the animals. Take them with you. All that will go.”
Wildkeeper Jvaile hesitated.
“You intend to keep fighting, Empress?”
“Yes. This is Tiqr. We will not yield.”
The [Druid] hesitated. She was no politician.
“I have heard it said Savere extended an offer of surrender to Tiqr.”
“Yes. And Nerrhavia. Our surrender would be absolute. We would give our people to slavery.”
The [Empress]’s eyes flashed. The Siren would see her in chains, groveling. Nerrhavia’s Queen was little better. The Wildkeeper bowed her head. She and Nsiia were of one mind of her answer to that.
“Empress, this war cannot be won. The herds have fallen.”
“Yes.”
Thef. Was. Dead. The [Druid] paused.
“We will take the young. There are Grand Elephants young, and regular ones. They will not end. But—Empress—”
She looked up, meeting Nsiia’s hollow gaze.
“—the elephants have seen the blood. They know the death.”
Nsiia nodded. Elephants remembered.
“The elephant’s memory is long as ours. Longer, sometimes, I think. This is their home. And they will remember it forever.”
