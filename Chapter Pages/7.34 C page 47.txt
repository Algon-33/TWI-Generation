“They can say that. But the truth is it doesn’t matter. They’ll let me do whatever I want. I could stab you and they’d keep using me. Lock me up, probably. But I’m too valuable. Don’t you see?”
“No. I—are you well, Sir Tom?”
She reached for him, wondering if he was sick. With the Yellow Rivers disease? Six of her [Soldiers] had caught it before they’d left. The [Clown] slapped away her hands.
“I’m fine. I’m—let’s just die, Commander.”
“We’re not going to die. Human. If that’s what you are.”
Chief Warrior Merish spoke up. He had a hand on his axe. Tom twisted his head, unnaturally too far around. Cirille heard his tendons cracking.
“What are you? A Gnoll? Better than those Dog-people who think they’re dogs. That’s the best way to make slaves, right?”
Neither one understood what he was saying. The [Clown] leaned on one of his following, a grinning harlequin who hadn’t blinked once. He started laughing.
“What do we…?”
Cirille looked around. Then she heard a voice.
“Tom. Stop this. You promised me you’d try.”
The Drake twisted. She saw a floating [Knight]. Richard. The [Knight] stared down at his friend. Tom looked up.
“It doesn’t matter, Richard. Let me have this. It doesn’t matter. I’ll kill for Lord Hayvon. I’m not bothering Commander Cirille much. I like her. It’s just—”
He glanced over the Drake’s shoulder and started laughing. This time, he didn’t stop. He laughed harder and harder, until he fell down. Guffawing? Cirille felt there should be a stronger word for the intensity, the force of the laugh. Bellows, gales of hysterical screaming.
“Tom! We need to get him a calming tonic. Or something. I’m sorry, Commander Cirille—”
The [Knight] landed, striding over to Tom. Cirille hurried forwards as well. Tom was laughing.
Heartbeat.
Tom lay on the ground, laughing. The wall was in confusion as he didn’t stop laughing. It seemed as though he should have run out of air long ago. But he laughed and laughed.
“Shut him up! He’s embarrassing us!”
Emily was shouting up at the walls. Richard bent for Tom. Cirille felt her heart thump.
Thump.
“Stop, Tom—you have to stop.”
“Stop, Richard? Don’t you see? I told you it didn’t matter. Look. You don’t even see!”
Thump.
The [Clown] laughed. He rolled around. And then some of his followers began to laugh. They pointed. Cirille thought they were mocking Richard. Or her.
Thump.
Then she heard something else. A wailing siren. The Drake [Commander] turned. She heard a horn blaring, high and shrill.
“That’s the call to arms.”
Dumbly, she looked at Tom. Had he done that? But no—it wasn’t him.
“All hands to the walls!”
The Bastion-General was bellowing. More horns began to sound. Richard looked up, at Cirille. Then, slowly, the Human and Drake turned around.
Monarch’s Pass. Just a speck on the horizon. The distant place where monsters came from. Of course—the Demons were the biggest threat. They could come from anywhere. Monsters were their weapons. A tool. But aside from Crelers and a few—they were just…monsters. A known quantity. But if you thought that—you forgot.
This was Rhir. And from hell, all things came.
Thump.
This time Cirille felt it and knew it was not her heart. She stared. Then she saw the horizon move.
Something took a step. It walked. As the horns blew across the 5th Wall, the defenders of Rhir, the irregulars, and the [Clown] saw it.
A twisting mass of things. Dark, coiling bodies.
“Serpents?”
“Those are not snakes.”
Commander Uxel hissed. He drew his scimitars. Commander Cirille stared.
“That thing is massive. Is that a Demon Giant? I thought—I thought the Giants were dead.”
