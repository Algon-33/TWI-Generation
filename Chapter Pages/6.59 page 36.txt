“You can stay, Erin. Right, Pisces?”
“Surely.”
Erin hesitated, and then sat down. Pisces drank, coughed, and drank again. He spoke.
“Calvaron was my friend. He never scorned me. Just kept away after everyone found out who I was. He did help me. And he died when I broke the ward on Nekhret’s tomb. It was my fault. And I regret his death. It was my fault.”
That needed to be said. Ceria nodded. She squeezed Pisces’ arm and he looked at her.
“Montressa has a reason to hunt me.”
“Cognita said it best. [Mages] have made worse mistakes and been expelled. The Council held you to the same standard. Her standard. Montressa can hate you. Hate me. But it was a mistake.”
Yvlon and Ksmvr nodded. Pisces stared past them. Erin waved a hand and they all looked at her.
“You know, she has nightmares. Almost every night, unless she uses a [Sleep] spell. Or a [Calm] spell or something. I heard it from Palt.”
“Who?”
“The Centaur. He told me a bit about Montressa.”
The Horns stared at Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked down and twiddled her thumbs. She spoke quietly.
“She watched someone get killed. Right in front of her. She was there. That’s why she…but I bet you knew that.”
She looked at Pisces. He nodded heavily.
“She has a reason.”
“But not enough. If you did it for a reason, that’s one thing. She hated you because you were a [Necromancer]. That’s another.”
Pisces jumped. He looked around. Someone else was listening to his story. He saw a green, light-scaled Drake, listening. Lyonette and Mrsha were standing with her. Pisces stood up unconsciously.
Selys. She looked at Pisces. Her eyes were red too. She reached out and hugged him.
“I’m so sorry. I didn’t do a thing.”
“You couldn’t have done anything.”
“But—”
Selys was shaking her head. Ceria saw another Drake past her. This one had blue scales. She narrowed her eyes. Then she stood up and went over to him.
Olesm hunched furtively at his table. He was wearing a hat and a coat, but his scales were as obvious as the sun. He looked around.
“Ceria. I uh—”
“Olesm.”
Ceria stared down at him. The [Strategist] flinched. They had spoken after Lism’s campaign against Calruz. Selys hadn’t noticed him, but Erin had. She shrugged at Selys. Olesm licked his lips nervously. He opened his mouth, and looked at Ceria.
“Look, I know—I know you probably hate my guts. But I had to see if you were okay. Do you need a healing potion? I heard Yvlon’s arms weren’t good. So I bought an anti-infection poultice. It’s better than a potion. And…”
He shut up as Ceria stared down at him. The [Strategist] hung his head.
“I’m sorry too. I thought you should know this. One of the [Mages], the Minotauress, went to see Calruz.”
“She did?”
Ceria turned pale. Olesm raised his claws.
“Don’t worry! He’s fine. She left. I doubled the guard on the prison just to be sure. The cell can’t be pierced by magic anyways. But I—I’ll go. I just wanted—”
Ceria looked down at Olesm. She wanted to say a lot, but in the end she just grabbed his shoulder.
“Come here.”
She towed him over to the table. Selys was sitting, and Mrsha was sitting on her lap. Pisces looked up at Ceria and Selys glared. But she let him sit.
And they listened.
“I have joined cults. I have met other [Necromancers]. Stolen. Lied. Killed rarely. And never without cause. But it’s true. I have done much that is wrong, but none more so than in Wistram.”
Pisces looked around the table. Ceria nodded heavily, but her shoulders felt lighter. She heard an exclamation near the door and looked up. Yvlon tensed.
“Not now.”
