“It has been a long time since I took my first life. So long, that I cannot even remember who it was or how. Or why. But—I still remember a young woman who swore she would never forget that day. Yet that day itself? I am old. Too old to have been a mother to my daughter.”
“Why did you do it, then?”
Ryoka was endlessly curious. But she felt the moment coming to a close. The fire tornado was moving again, ever so slowly. But she and Belavierr clung to this conversation. Both feared the future. Belavierr shook her head.
“I don’t know. But there she lay. And she looked up at me. And she would have died had I not picked her up. So I did. Because it filled something in me.”
And that was it. A monster. Immortal. Unfeeling. Distant. A [Witch]. But it was her. Wiskeria alone who grounded her. Ryoka just didn’t understand why. So she asked.
“Why? Why are you going to die for her? Why can’t you leave her or let her die and not care like so many others? Belavierr the Stitch Witch, why does Wiskeria matter to you?”
The Stitch Witch looked at her. And she took a long time in replying.
“In any sewing, there is a first stitch and a last stitch. And there must be a knot. An ending, or else what is made must unravel.”
Ryoka nodded.
“So is Wiskeria the first or last stitch?”
Another look.
“She is my daughter, not a thread. I am making a comparison. We each are a tapestry, a weaving. And she was not the first or last thread in mine. I am my own work. And yet, somehow, though my first stitch was sewn long before hers, her threads and mine are interwoven. We are tangled together. But separate.”
Belavierr wove her fingers together, staring at them. She went on, quietly.
“And yet, somehow, despite my daughter’s youth. Despite that she and I share no blood save for the original blood of humanity, she matters to my tapestry. She is bright color on darkest cloth. Without her, night is the same as day. Without her, contrast fails. And I would have no meaning.”
She looked up, looking slightly…
“It is how I can explain it. Does that answer your question, Ryoka Griffin?”
“Yeah.”
The City Runner looked away. And she stood up. She avoided Belavierr’s eyes as the [Witch] looked questioningly at her. Then Ryoka turned and nodded.
“I wish my mother had said she loved me like that. So that’s why it’s your death.”
Belavierr nodded. There she sat. And the moment passed. Ahead of her, the tornado burned. Ryoka looked ahead. Belavierr spoke.
“I would like to be loved. I am afraid of death. My daughter must live. But I fear death. So I look for an alternative. Perhaps there is one. But a mother’s love holds me here. But you. You have no child. Why do you run to your death? You fear it too, don’t you?”
“Oh yes.”
Ryoka looked ahead. And the fire howled. The wind blew hot on her face and she shivered. She was afraid.
“Then why do you run to yours?”
The young woman turned. And she smiled at Belavierr. At the curious face. Ryoka breathed in. And she sighed. She reached for her belt and touched a bit of frozen courage. A bit of friendship.
“Because I have a choice. And I’m afraid of who I would be if I left. I’d like to be a good person.”
“How strange.”
Ryoka laughed. And then she began to run. She left the [Witch] where she sat. And she ran forwards, trotting, jogging, and then running. And ahead of her a twister of ash and flame bore down on her.
“Wind. Come on. I know you’re more than a tool for someone to use. You’re free. Come on. Run with me.”
