Yet…the wind did blow cold. And a [Knight] shouted it. And because he shouted it, it must be true. He was a [Knight]. He fooled even his own Order. Greysten’s lips moved in horror. He almost laughed. But that was not the Winter’s Watcher. And that charge was—
 
——
 
Rabbiteater was laughing. Ser Markus was bellowing, crimson with embarrassment. But Ailendamus was recoiling as one army. The air was cold. The [Soldiers] stared in horror at the legend of frost. Or what they thought was the Winter’s Watcher.
The cold?
Ser Ilm had a wand in one glove.
“[Cold Air]. [Cold Air]…”
He was concentrating so hard on blasting the enemy army that he nearly was caught from behind. For the Order of the Hydra had doubled their chase.
“Rabbiteater, they’re all turning on us!”
“Good. Pheislant gets away if we die.”
The pikes were lowering. A [General] was bellowing; Rabbiteater heard his voice.
“[Hold the Line]! The brave Order of Hydra will bring down this Winter’s Watcher! Hold your ground, brave sons and daughters of Ailendamus!”
Damn. Rabbiteater saw the glittering tips of spears. He looked back. Then he sped up.
“Rabbiteater!”
But the [Champion] had drawn his axe. A cloak of blood flew behind him as the glowing axe rose. The [Pikemen] stared in grim terror at the [Knight] bearing down on them. They would fight to the death.
So be it. Something was calling to him. He felt it in his chest. Tidebreaker. He felt like he could almost triumph. Almost…almost…
But why couldn’t he reach it? Why? Something was in the way of that feeling. Conflicting. The power of the greatest [General] of Izril…faltered.
Because it wasn’t all he was. He wasn’t Rabbiteater of war. He wasn’t even as good at it as his brothers. Shorthilt. Numbtongue. Headscratcher. Badarrow. Rabbiteater was the average one. And Zel Shivertail had not been the only one in that memory.

Erin Solstice sat there at a table, smiling at him.
“Is this it? Hey. Hey.”
She poked Zel. The [General] snapped.
“You poking me is the rudest gesture imaginable, Miss Solstice.”
“Well, sorry. It’s a Goblin thing. You calling them rude, huh?”
The Drake [General] gave Erin a withering look that said she was beneath that kind of argument. And Rabbiteater—
 
——
 
Laughed. The burning strength in his arms faded. She was there too. Inside his memory. He clung to that.
Home. A different kind of strength. The two warred in him. He was afraid. He didn’t want to die.
He was doing it for both reasons. He had never fought for glory. Only for the inn. Friends. His tribe. His family. But the strength to do it…
He saw the line of pikes approaching. Not yet. He didn’t—he didn’t think he could—
The [Champion] plunged onwards, fighting to seize one or the other. Unable to reconcile the feelings. Meisa spurred her horse, shouting for him to stop. She was too slow.
They were Spring Knights. Even Rabbiteater was too low-level. Spring was young. It needed more. It needed age to grow. Light and wrath, even winter to temper it.
So the [Knight] shouted. Summer’s wrath.
“Knights of Summer! To arms! To the Winter’s Watcher! With me—charge! Charge!”
The Order of the Hydra turned, too late. They saw a second wedge of armored figures, a full lance, thundering to their left. Orange and yellow and red. The colors of summer.
Talia Kallinad lowered her lance as Rabbiteater twisted in his saddle. The [Summer Knights] accelerated, as the faith of the first line of pikes wavered. They saw the light blazing from the tips of the lances, a match for their pikes. Heard the massed oath.
“Summer fades!”
