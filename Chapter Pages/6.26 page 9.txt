“Miss! Miss! Are you alright?”
Bethal turned. The scarecrow was waving at her. Bemused, she saw him run over. Then she saw how the [Farmer] had disguised herself and laughed. He wasn’t laughing. The man put an arrow in all four bodies on the ground as he checked the road. Only Bethal and Thomast’s horses were moving, trotting back and snorting, eyes wide. The scarecrow archer looked around.
“What—what were they? [Bandits]?”
“[Assassins]. Thank you for your help, sir.”
Bethal curtsied in her riding dress. The [Farmer] looked at her with wide eyes. Then he cursed and raised his bow. Someone was leaping towards them down the road. It was Thomast. His steps blurred him forwards, much like the [Flash Step] spell. The [Fencer] stopped, eying the [Farmer]. The scarecrow put down his bow.
“Thomast. Did you get them?”
The [Chevalier] shook his head.
“I caught one. The other one would have taken me too long. There might be more about.”
He reached for his side and wiped his blade on a handkerchief, then tossed it aside as he stared at the [Farmer]. The man stared at him, with awe as much as fear. Then at Bethal. The [Lady] was frowning, and in his opinion, far, far too composed after what had just happened.
“Do you think there might be more on the road back?”
“Or around us, waiting for me to lower my guard.”
Thomast nodded. He looked around warily. The [Farmer] hesitated, and then broke in, waving one hand.
“Not on my farm, sir. No one enters my fields, animal or person without my knowing it. Them six were the only ones about. And you two.”
Both Bethal and Thomast looked at him. Uncertainly, the [Farmer] waved at his farm.
“You’ll be safe there. At least, I’ll know when someone comes closer. Even a Level 40 [Thief] can’t hide on my lands. So long as we’re right on them. Come on. We can hide there and I can call for some help. Blow a horn, maybe—”
He was beckoning them towards his fields, eyes wide with fright. Bethal looked at Thomast. He raised his brows. Bethal looked the scarecrow archer, and then eyed his field of corn. She clapped her hands.
“Very well. What did you say your name was, sir [Farmer]?”
The man hesitated.
“Who? Me, Miss? Lupp.”
 
—-
 
“So this is your farm? And you live here alone?”
Around fifteen minutes later, Lady Bethal was sitting on Lupp’s porch, eying his fields and home with interest. Thomast was silently staring at the one cow. Lupp was still shaking.
“That’s right, uh, uh, Lady Bethal. I live by myself. I’m a simple man, so forgive my rudeness.”
“You may call me Bethal. And I owe you a debt of gratitude, sir. Thomast might have been badly hurt, charms or not. You helped us and I will not forget that.”
The [Lady] gave Lupp a bright, beautiful smile. She was out of place in his normal, regular farm. But her presence was also soothing, so Lupp began to stop hyperventilating. He gestured at the black bodies lying on the road.
“You’re awfully calm, Lady—Miss Bethal. Is being attacked that normal to you?”
“More than you might think, sir. Assassins? Rare. But I’ve seen worse.”
The [Lady] turned her head to regard her husband. The [Farmer] licked his lips.
“I’ve seen worse too. But I’ve never actually seen an [Assassin] before. You hear stories—but sometimes I think they’re just stories. The Assassin’s Guild isn’t real, though, is it?”
“All too real. And all too mundane, I’m afraid. Thomast, stop bothering that cow. What do you think they were?”
Thomast turned his head. The two horses were calmly grazing nearby. The [Chevalier] sighed.
