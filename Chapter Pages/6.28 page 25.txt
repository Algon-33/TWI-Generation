“Sir, I can’t just send a priority request. Let alone to the army. That’s a serious alert! I’d have to get the Watch Captain’s permission at least to do that. Or the Council’s. Or Strategist Olesm’s. Do you have their authorization?”
“I—the Council is indisposed, but I’m acting on their behalf! This concerns them!”
Lism pounded a clawed fist on the desk. The [Receptionist] stared at it. And then at him. She frowned slowly.
“Maybe I should call my boss. Sir. Please hold on.”
She backed up, making a not-so-convert gesture to one of the other [Receptionists]. Lism saw the Gnoll pull a tiny string that would ring an outside bell. For the Watch. He flushed and bellowed.
“There isn’t any time for this! I demand an instant [Message] to the High Command! They need to hear this! Don’t you dare pull that string again! Do you know who I am?”
They blinked at him. The Drake [Receptionist] opened her mouth, peered at Lism, and then shook her head slowly.
“…No.”
