Interlude – Talia

Rags wanted any number of items. Badarrow nodded until he came to the cloth objects that Rabbiteater had ordered. He prodded one and stared at Rabbiteater.
“What this? Not bandages.”
“Don’t know. Female Goblins want.”
Rabbiteater shrugged. He looked at Snapjaw. She took one and felt the fabric happily.
“For blood. Better wipe. Softer.”
“For butt?”
Badarrow looked blank. Snapjaw glared at him.
“No! Other place!”
“Huh.”
The three Hobgoblins paused a moment. Rabbiteater silently unloaded his bag of holding and Badarrow and Snapjaw divided the load. It was a good haul; he’d spent the money he earned well. After a moment, he pointed back the way he’d come.
“Stay away from Order of Seasons. Smells like weather.”
“What kind of death are they?”
Snapjaw looked up. Her crimson eyes glinted. Rabbiteater paused. He switched to the Goblin tongue then, to more accurately approximate their fighting strength in their terms.
“Screaming, fighting, cornered death. Maybe worse death.”
Badarrow nodded. He inspected his bow, glanced up. After a long pause, Rabbiteater looked at him. Reluctantly, he asked the real question he knew Badarrow wanted him to ask. It was written in every line of his posture, and Goblins spoke with bodies as much as words.
“Chieftain say anything?”
Both Hobs nodded. Badarrow glanced up at Rabbiteater. He tried to smile, but he had never been used to it. And Rabbiteater’s heart was missing since the battle. He’d left it in an inn, in the past. He shouldn’t have run. He should have died—
“She say ‘good work’. And—can come back if want.”
“I don’t want to.”
The two Hobs paused, then nodded. Rabbiteater sat down. They sat too. One of the Carn Wolves sniffed and Snapjaw threw him part of the bone she was eating. Rabbiteater stared at nothing. Then he looked up.
“Redscar?”
“Strong. Good.”
Another nod. Rabbiteater had no more questions. After a moment, Badarrow looked around.
“Lots of Humans. Hard to hide. What do?”
Rabbiteater hesitated. But the answer came out of him before he knew what he was saying.
“Going north. Find more Goblins. Go around. Maybe go with [Knights].”
Both Hobgoblins sat up, their postures and expressions radiating shock. Incredulity. Badarrow looked at Rabbiteater.
“No! Bad idea! Dangerous! Discover-death. Surrounded death!”
“Don’t care. Humans don’t see.”
“Dogs smell! I smell! Bad idea. Bad. You come back—”
“No.”
Rabbiteater resisted Snapjaw’s arm. She stared at him. Her head was bigger than normal and her mouth was huge. She could bite through a Gargoyle’s skin with her metallic teeth. Rabbiteater met her eyes, and then looked away. He stood up.
“I’m going. Tell Chieftain I’ll get her what she wants. Pretend to be Goblin Slayer. Go with [Knights]. Don’t come back. Too dangerous.”
For them. But he didn’t care. The [Champion] stood alone, his armor gleaming thanks to his Skills. But his expression was bleak. He reached for his helmet and put it on. Wearing a false identity.
Lost.
The Goblin Slayer began to walk away from his friends. After a moment, Badarrow stood up. He shouted, breaking the silence, ignoring the danger.
“Rabbiteater!”
The visor turned back to him. Snapjaw scrambled up a rock and stared around. Badarrow walked down towards Rabbiteater. The [Sniper] hesitated. Then he reached out, grabbed Rabbiteater’s shoulder.
“Chieftain say when fortress finished in mountains, go back to inn. Secret. Few.”
