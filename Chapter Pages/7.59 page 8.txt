But those arrows. Chaldion had a few Skills that would protect Saliss, but the Named Adventurer had dodged almost everything. The ones who needed it were—

Arrows. They were landing around her. Ryoka felt a pressure on her head! No—it was squeezing her. Maviola was suffering from the same.
“Long-range hexes!”
Saliss cursed. Ryoka felt the ring Hedault had given her glowing, burning her finger as it fought them off. There were [Mages] throwing their own clouds of darkness, trying to slow them. And the arrows!
“Forwards! My Skill! I have to use it! [S—”
Maviola cried out. So did her mare. More arrows were falling. Ryoka cried out. A cloud of black fog was flying towards them.
“Maviola!”
“I’ll stop that cloud! Grab her! Potion of Dispel! No? Damn! Get the cloud, Ryoka!”
Saliss lobbed more vials as Ryoka went for Maviola. She looked up as another volley was called. No—
“[Volley: Blacksteel Rain]! [Instantaneous Reload]! Kill them!”
Everyone got Skills. Ryoka raised her hand. The arrows and the fog were coming. And one was death. She blew the fog away. And two clouds of bolts and arrows, loosed so fast they were one storm, fell towards them.
Her ears popped. The pressure on her head—Maviola’s head was turning.
“Not the hex—”
Ryoka’s ring had stopped burning. Yet she still felt like something—someone was grasping her. Her—shoulder?
“Well, we can’t have this, can we?”
Someone spoke in her ear. Ryoka felt the pressure intensify. The poisoned arrows flew downwards—and the voice spoke again.
“[Greater Blessing of Armor].”
The arrows—bounced off Ryoka’s skin. Maviola straightened. Ryoka felt something—she looked around.
“Who was that?”

Venith Crusland stared at the King of Destruction. Flos Reimarch had a sheen of sweat on his face. He’d struggled for the last ten minutes. But at last—
“Your Majesty? How did you…?”
“I’m tired of watching such entertaining events unfolding. I thought I could do it and went for it. You may have to adjust your battle plans, Venith.”
The [King] grinned. His eyes sparked as he saw the three moving through the arrows, past the confused [Assassins].
“Confirmed, [Blessing of Armor]. But who could have used—”
The King of Destruction laughed. He straightened. “I am the King of Destruction. If I want to bless them, I will. [Rapid March]. [Induction: The King’s S—”
He hesitated, lowered his hand. Flos scratched at the back of his head and chuckled.
“Well, not yet. I got carried away there. Hah! But wouldn’t it be funny if—Venith? Don’t look at me like that.”

The King of Destruction. Pandemonium. Chaos. Just the kind of thing that Flos Reimarch lived for.
The Archmage of Terandria ignored the screaming Drakes in the scrying orb with gritted teeth as best he could.
“Silence them! I need to concentrate!”
He ordered the others. The linked group of [Mages] agreed. Archmage Viltach focused the magic in Wistram to his will.
His eyes were on the three, fleeing the [Assassins] still. They had switched to spells while the blessing was in effect.
One of them was from Earth. For that alone—Viltach inhaled, exhaled. He was no [Archmage]. Not yet. But he was not one of the greatest [Mages] of Wistram for nothing.
“[Greater Far Cast]. [Concentrate Mana]. I need to overload this spell. Someone use the [Indirect Hex] Skill! [Area of Diffusion]—”
The [Mages] were murmuring Skills, using their magic to target a spot so far out of range of Wistram—it took fourteen of them of Viltach’s circle, linked with him. But still—
“[Greater Lightning Bolt].”
