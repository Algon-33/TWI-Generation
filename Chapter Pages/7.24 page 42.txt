Much like a certain City Runner. But here we are, and the next chapter will come out in a few days! Hope you enjoyed this one! There has been so much amazing stuff.
Volume 2 is now on Audible for preorder! It will come out July 14th if all goes well, so if you have a credit, drop it on the audiobook if you’re so inclined! Don’t buy it straight out. That’s a lotta money.
Also, amazing art! For this chapter, I have to feature just one artist (but there is a TON to feature and I will do it every chapter, as usual), Enuryn! They did Tails and Scales and it is a gorgeous picture! Much thanks to them and as always, hope you enjoy and thanks for reading!
