Interlude – Meetings and Friendships
Page 14
The two [Ladies] sat together. Suddenly, Maviola felt a weight on her shoulders. The shoulders of her soul. She looked at Gresaria.
“Soon? But you look…”
The white-haired [Lady] slapped one shoulder, scratching at an itch and winced.
“That’s just combat Skills. I’ll drop dead in public sometime. That’s how my father went. Just—at random. Probably some ceremony. Now wouldn’t that be funny.”
She laughed. Maviola tried to, but it was too hard. Gresaria eyed Maviola.
“Then again, I could do what you’re doing. Before I turn senile, like my aunt. Remember how she went? Forgot everything? I—I’ve been doing that now and then. Even with the intellect-potions. Forget a ship’s coming in. Or go for a walk and forget why I’m standing outside.”
“Gresaria…”
“So this is how you’re going to die, is it? How long do you have?”
Maviola’s old enemy looked at her, searchingly. Maviola didn’t hedge.
“About twelve days. Unless something happens.”
Gresaria’s eyes flickered.
“You have a connection to Pallass. What, got another fortune tucked away to hire Saliss of Lights?”
“I don’t. But it might happen.”
The cracked lips parted. They were in good shape for two old women. Magic slowed age a lot compared to someone without the money to pay for spells. Even so—
“Huh. If you get a spare potion, give one to me. I’d like to end things like you do. It’s so elegant. I applauded you when I heard about it, Maviola.”
“Thank you.”
The [Harbormistress] took another sip, then pushed her drink away. Maviola blinked. That was only a mug and three quarters. Even the weakest ale? Gresaria, who had once out-drunk a Minotaur?
“I don’t know if I will, though. I have children and grandchildren and the thought of them surrounding me is appealing in itself. Some proper mourning? Maybe a few tears. I could abide by that kind of ending. But you…that didn’t appeal?”
Maviola El sat there for a while. She smiled.
“Not particularly. Fulviolo had children. I didn’t. I’m sure the family would mourn me—but it’s not as appealing.”
“How depressing. You should have married someone good.”
The younger [Lady] laughed and then slapped the table in outrage. She pointed at Gresaria.
“You stole Regein’s heart from me. Don’t complain about the consequences. There’s still time to give him back.”
“Bah, you’d kill him. He’s not long for it either. Not the right Skills, Maviola. He’s too weak to leave bed and he’s forgotten his children.”
“Oh. Your letters said that. Gresaria…”
The two trailed off. Gresaria sighed. And then smiled.
“Enough about us. What have you done with yourself, Maviola El? I thought you’d go further than Liscor. That’s farther than either of us ever went, I’ll grant you. But—was that a fine young Drake I saw?”
She grinned again. Maviola laughed.
“Let me tell you, then, Gresaria…and what I plan to do before I go.”
They sat there for a while. Talking. Gresaria laughed, snorted out her drink, scowled, and asked questions. She glanced at Erin Solstice once. But after the sun had moved across the skies, she stood up.
It had been hours. But it felt too short. Like bare minutes. Yet—that was it. The old [Harbormistress] stood.
“Good. Good. If you have a chance—take it. That’s what I say. Anything but the Temptress. I tried to throw her overboard when she came for me. I’ll wait to hear of you. Don’t you dare die quietly, Maviola. But that’s it for me.”
“You’re…going home?”
Maviola looked at Gresaria. The old woman nodded.
