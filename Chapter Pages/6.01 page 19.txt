“You’re a lot more physical than I thought you’d be. You’re so reserved.”
“Well, I have to be. But I’m not, so cut out with that stupid accent. I grew up with a lot of brothers, so I’m used to fights. Vampire fights.”
Ryoka imagined what rough housing would be like with a vampire’s strength. No wonder the Drakles lived in a stone keep.
“How many brothers do you have? Rivel’s one of them, right?”
“That’s right. He’s the only one who stays at home. The others…well, I have one who moved away.”
“That’s two. Not exactly a lot.”
Ryoka grinned. Fierre’s face fell.
“I—had a lot of brothers.”
“Oh. Sorry.”
“It’s fine. It was a long time ago.”
But it wasn’t fine. The two began walking now. Ryoka could see Reizmelt in the distance. But she was looking at Fierre. This was the heart of it. After a while, Fierre spoke.
“You noticed my mother’s rash, right? On her right arm?”
“I did. Like I said, I didn’t know vampires could get sick. That’s why I had my doubts you were one at first. I thought you were acting.”
“No. We get sick. Miss Kelysta’s always giving me free potions because of it. They help, they really do. But it costs a lot, so even though we make a lot, it goes to potions. Expensive ones, sometimes. Mother’s not the only one. Bamer’s sick most of the time, but it’s not often bad. But my father—”
“I noticed his neck. I thought he was born like that.”
Fierre breathed in and out slowly.
“No. The neck, and other things happen to vampires at they grow older. It gets worse with time. It’s…a thing that happens. Bamer calls it a curse. The neck, the swelling—that happens. Not just to vampires, but that started about six years back for Dad. We just get sick more easily, that’s all. Mom’s had that rash for ages, Rivel’s healthy, but he used to get terrible fevers. Bamer’s coughed all his life. I got sick last month.”
“And it hasn’t cleared up?”
Fierre shook her head.
“It’s not as bad as some illnesses. I just…shiver sometimes. And cough. I’m healthy, mostly. But vampires don’t live long.”
“Because of the sickness?”
“It’s always something. Something gets you. A bad illness. Or—or something goes wrong and they start going mad. Sometimes it’s like Bamer and you just get…weaker. But that’s the price of being a vampire, right?”
Fierre looked back at Ryoka. The young woman bit her lip.
“All the children get sick?”
“Not at first. It gets worse over time. But we do get sick more often. More and more.”
“I see. Tell me one thing. Was it always like this?”
“Not in the past. That’s what Bamer says. But centuries ago it started. He thinks the Byres family cursed us after we went into hiding.”
“After you stopped preying on people and started drinking animal blood.”
“Yes.”
Ryoka bit her lip. But she said nothing because it was just a suspicion. But a big one. Fierre walked on in silence. After a while they began to chat again, and pretended that the last conversation hadn’t happened.
And they reached Reizmelt at midday.

“Your face is tanned.”
“Shh. Don’t draw attention to it.”
“Or your shad—”
Ryoka yelped as an elbow struck her in the side. She pushed her way into the Huntress’ Haven, Fierre at her side. The inn was still open, but it was, as usual, completely des—
“There she is!”
Both girls froze. A group of five adventurers were sitting inside the inn, talking with Mad Madain. And a large dog was sitting at their feet, licking a plate clean. It got to its feet as the adventurers turned. Ryoka recognized them at once.
“Miss Wind Runner!”
“You’re back. Had a nice night out?”
