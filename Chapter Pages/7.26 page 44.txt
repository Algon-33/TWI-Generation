Although both had wounds. Maviola had a cut on one cheek. Bethal had nails like razors. The [Lady Firestarter] laughed and laughed. This was worth it! All of it!
“I have to play with Olesm. This game. How have I never heard of it? How—”
She turned. And then her face went gray. Maviola stumbled, felt a pain in her arms, legs—her heart was beating too fast. She looked down and her hands were wrinkled.
“No—”
The [Lady] reached for her belt. Her hands were shaking. She plucked a glowing viridian vial from her belt. Opened it. Drank, begging the potion to—
The shaking stopped. Maviola lay on the ground, licking the vial, letting every last drop fall into her mouth. She stood up, panting.
“Three weeks.”
That was all she said. Her heart began to beat normally again. She took another breath. Then walked out, to make the most of her time. It was worth it.
Ratici emerged from The Wandering Inn to see Wilovan running. The Gentleman Caller was a big Gnoll. But he moved with an agility that fooled even Relc. He kicked the ball—and Garia kicked it back. The [Thug] dodged the deadly projectile as it shot down the pitch. He caught his hat.
“I say, what a lovely sport this is.”
He was smiling. The others were laughing. Erin clapped her hands—and Ryoka grabbed her. The City Runner’s face was white.
“Erin.”
“What? This is great! Garia’s so good, Ryoka—”
“Erin, this is being broadcast. Live!”
Ryoka pointed. Erin turned. Only then did she see Sir Relz, Noass. She hadn’t realized. No—she’d been on the scrying orb. But she’d been so caught up in the excitement and they’d been here before. She didn’t see the problem at first. Ryoka put it into clarity with one word.
“Wistram. This is soccer! Football! Damn it, whichever! They know!”
Erin Solstice went pale. She looked at Joseph.
“No. But—”
Like this? She’d been careful! She’d tried to be! She’d made deals with Montressa, and Beza—
But both [Mages] were speaking urgently as they raised their fingers to their temples. And they were looking around. Montressa met Erin’s eyes.
The air froze between them as Montressa looked away. Erin stood up. Suddenly—she was afraid.
“What do we do?”
“It’s too late to stop the broadcast. Erin, get out of sight. I can’t be heard! If they hear my voice—”
Ryoka was panting with nerves. What did this mean? What would happen? She hadn’t even witnessed the kidnap attempt of the Horns of Hammerad. Erin had. She clenched her fists.
“No. What do I do? What…”
She looked around. Suddenly afraid. Not knowing what she could do against this. The Academy. The sudden revelation. She turned. Ryoka was looking for help. Perhaps Fierre could…?
Erin ran too. Looking for someone to help her. For Grand Mage Eldavin, or—
And there he was. She looked for him, and he was just standing there.
Having a quiet rollup as he watched the games. A smile on his face. Palt turned as the [Innkeeper] ran up to him.
“Palt!”
He looked at her. The words spilled from Erin’s mouth. Her fears, the Earthers being revealed. The Centaur looked at her.
Was he an ally as he claimed? Or was he one of them? The [Illusionist]’s brows snapped together. He looked up, saw the scrying orb, cursed. The dreamleaf cigar dropped from his mouth and he caught it.
“Of course. I should have known.”
“What do we do? I don’t want—”
Erin was close to panicking as she had been this entire year. Palt looked at her. And the Centaur inhaled. His brows snapped together—and then he smiled.
“I have an idea. Hold this.”
He handed the cigar to Erin. She blinked at it. Then she saw the Centaur trot forwards. And then gallop.
