Trey hated that stupid game so much. He didn’t know why she’d kept it on her iPhone. But it was topical to their world, and Flos was fascinated.
“And you play that game to receive the highest score? That is fun! Simple, yes. A children’s game?”
“Oh no. Adults play it too. It’s just for passing the time.”
“I see, I see. How convenient. Well, allow me to try.”
“Go ahead!”
Teres gave it to Flos with the sweetest of smiles. She’d gotten to nine in her little demonstration, but Flos hadn’t missed the number at the top of the screen. He stroked his beard.
“Eighty three? Fascinating. Even your words resemble ours so much. But enough of such questions. This is your best. Well, I will tap to play and—”
The little bird went up. Flos tapped, copying Teres.
“Up, and up, and—ah!”
It ran into the pipe. Not the second pipe, the first one. Flos’ face fell. Teres’ smile grew wider.
“What a fragile bird. Can’t it move properly?”
Flos muttered. The [King] stared at the screen.
“You can start over. See?”
“Of course! A second attempt! Are there penalties for…?”
“Nope. Keep playing!”
He did. Flos tapped, and this time the bird got past the first pipe. The second, the third—it hit the sixth. Flos’ brows furrowed together.
“Hold on. This little bird—”
“Harder than it looks, right?”
Teres asked innocently. The King of Destruction looked up from the phone. This time he saw Trey’s expression and her face. But he stubbornly tapped her iPhone.
“It’s a matter of timing. I’ve played far harder games. Orthenon tried to interest me in chess—this is—”
Tap, tap, tap. Gazi was watching her [King], the ruler of Reim and the man who’d conquered all of Chandrar, tap on the phone and watch his little bird die. Flos made it to thirteen. And then eighteen. And then four. He just didn’t have the rhythm down.
“Move down, you little pest! Why does it always move like—can’t it fly properly? What’s the point of this?”
“To win. And the bird always moves like that. It’s a challenge.”
Teres replied sweetly. She was enjoying Flos’ frustration to no end. The King of Destruction looked up with a huge scowl.
“I’m beginning to think you’ve played some trick on me, Teres.”
“Me? It’s just my iPhone. Nothing special. As simple as magic, right?”
The [King] narrowed his eyes. Then he turned.
“Magic? I never learned to cast it. On the other hand—Gazi, would you like a try with this infernal game?”
“If your Majesty wishes.”
Gazi smiled slightly. Trey looked at her. She took the iPhone cautiously—both she and Flos handled it as if it were glass, which it did look like. And Gazi tapped the screen.
“It’s easy. All you do is tap—”
Teres’ smug voice was cut off as Gazi swiveled one eye to look at her. The half-Gazer gave her a sharp-toothed grin.
“I have seen.”
She began to tap. Her pace was measured, deliberate. She was copying Teres! And unlike Flos, Gazi didn’t get excited. One of her eyes focused on the screen while the other three went roaming. Trey watched. Gazi tapped, tapped, tapped—and hit a pipe.
“Oops! Well done, though, Gazi.”
Flos smiled good-naturedly. The half-Gazer only shrugged. She met Teres’ smile with her own.
“If you’ll allow me to try again, your Majesty?”
“Very well.”
Flos waved a hand. This time Gazi focused two eyes on the screen. She began tapping. And her bird died again.
On pipe twelve. And it had missed the edge of the pipe by an invisible pixel. Gazi paused, blinked down at the screen. Then Trey saw three of her four eyes focus on the screen. Teres stopped grinning.
