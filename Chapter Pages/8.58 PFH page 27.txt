Ceria turned over her shoulder and saw half the Bleakbeaks were lying on the ground. The other half were trying to fly, swearing. The Bloodtear [Pirates] rolled their eyes.
Then Ceria yanked her skeleton hand up and a spear of ice shot up from the [Ice Floor], nearly impaling the closest [Pirate]. She leapt back with an oath. The rest charged. Ceria took one look at them and ran for it.
Omusc saw the half-Elf just turn around and book it. Walls of ice rose to block the charging [Pirates], but they just dodged around them. Three stopped and one went to hammer on her casket.
“Tough as a rock! Damn—”
“Let’s pour some poison in. Hold on, I’ve—”
A Human reached for a vial and his head exploded. A spike of ice had just shot out of the casket. The others recoiled.
“Get the [Cryomancer]! Scatter!”
They pounded after her. Ceria was running, but she was already getting winded. She had a decent dash like any adventurer, but she’d been running searching for Omusc. She slowed as the [Pirates] began to encircle her. Ceria exhaled.
“Alright…”
She turned as a [Pirate] leapt through the air. Ceria looked up, smiled—and then stopped running. She leapt, hit the ground with both feet planted—
And shot away. The [Pirate] missed, slashing, rolling, coming up—and nearly crashed as she ran onto the second [Ice Floor] spell. The Bloodtear Pirates saw the half-Elf kick the ground.
“Damn, damn—”
She accelerated. Turned. A [Pirate] ducked as an [Ice Spike] barely missed her face. She saw Ceria heading towards a wall and the [Cryomancer] cursed—
Then a lip of ice rose from the [Ice Floor] and turned her. She changed directions, and a Garuda running for her was caught flat-footed. A [Pirate] shot the [Raider] in the leg.
“Shoot her!”
Arrows flashed after Ceria, but she was accelerating. Moving faster. She was…
Skating. Shooting across the slicked ice, conjuring more across the plaza, creating shields of [Ice Walls] for cover. She was moving so fast.
This wasn’t some new technique. She had done this before. Like on a waxed inn’s floor. But the concept? She skated across the plaza, firing [Ice Spikes] at the [Pirates] and [Raiders].
Yet even that was a copy. She had known this—even before.
 
——
 
Even before. Revine’s hands were trembling on the stone railing of her palace. She stared down and whispered.
“Illphres.”
It was her technique. Movements created by someone who had once been told by the young [Mage] who would later be known as Archmage Viltach that ‘[Cryomancers] had no mobility’.
Just to spite him. And that [Cryomancer] had refined the technique, until the day Ceria Springwalker saw her skate across the sea.
Illphres’ apprentice flashed around the plaza, but the [Pirates] were moving to intercept her. She was Illphres’ first and only apprentice. But her magic was her own. Ceria turned. A [Raider] leapt at her and crashed into a midriff-high wall of ice.
The Stitch-woman began screaming. Revine couldn’t see why—until she saw the other [Pirates] and [Raiders] recoiling.
More walls of ice and ledges were rising. No—other shapes. What looked like some kind of ice-made clothesline, just a line of ice at waist-height. Yet the [Pirates] looked around and began moving for the edges of the plaza, suddenly in retreat.
Why? Then Revine saw the blood. The [Raider] was impaled—
On spikes of ice coming out of the wall. The [Ice Walls] were developing jagged edges. The thin line of ice was as sharp as a razor! And on this slick battlefield, where you could slide into it—
