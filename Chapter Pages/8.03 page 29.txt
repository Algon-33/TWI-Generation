He says it instantly. I can only hope he takes it seriously. Young Ryoka would. And he’s already seen it so I pull out the hilt.
Sammy’s eyes fix on it.
“What is it?”
“An artifact. Just an artifact, Sammy. I got it from the uh, strangers. But you can’t tell anyone or I’ll never forgive you. Got it?”
“What if they find out? And what will you do? Hit me?”
He looks at me, testing. I smile.
“Me? I don’t hit kids. I just won’t do amazing things for you, Sammy. Like…let you fly.”
He does a double-take.
“You can do that?”
I think of the parasailing kids and smile ruefully. I want to go back to Reizmelt and…but no. I cannot. Erin is frozen. And I know where to find the cure*.
 
*I should have grabbed it, taken the time to make Ivolethe break the magic on it. Dead gods, how will I get it now?
 
“Totally. I could do it in f—ten minutes if I wanted to. Let you fly about. Kids do it all the time. Why do you think they call me the Wind Runner?”
His eyes flicker as he tries to figure out how I’d do it. After a second, he looks at me.
“Without an artifact? And I could do it?”
“Without an artifact. And not even Jericha would be mad. I think.”
“I want to fly! And see the sword.”
“Well, if you keep it a secret…fine. As much flying as you want when I’m around.”
He nods rapidly. I sigh. Then I hold out my hand. He regards it, then shakes my hand briefly.
“Did you lose your fingers to the strangers? I heard they bit off—”
“No. Goblins.”
I withdraw my hand quickly and hide it. Sammial blinks at me; I’m not normally so self-conscious, but he does stare.
“Sorry. Father says never to point out a [Soldier]’s war wounds.”
He takes that more seriously than anything else and ducks his head. I sigh.
“It’s fine. Now—stand back.”
He obeys. I motion him back.
“Further back. It’s very sharp.”
“I saw. Can I hold it?”
My brain conjures the image of Sammial somehow bypassing the safety mechanism or cutting me and the room apart.
“Absolutely not. The deal was to look. Then you can fly. All we need are bed sheets. You can use mine.”
“Bed sheets? Oh—like the flying thing?”
He’s excited and young again. I half-smile. Speaking of flying things…well, for now, I grip the Faeblade*.

And it comes to life. Sammial gapes at the blade as I hold it very carefully up.
“It’s so amazing! Father showed me a Kaalblade—is it like that?”
Great cover, Sammial! I nod.
“Exactly like that. It’s a unique one, though.”
“Oh. And I thought it was super-special. It’s very pretty, though.”
He’s disappointed again. I sigh. Sammial eyes it, then looks at me.
“How strong is it? I saw you cut the floorboards.”
“Er—strong. It goes through steel.”
“What grade of magical artifact is it? Can it cut a [Hardening] enchantment? What about a mithril shield? All of father’s equipment can break weak magic.”
“I would love to know, Sammy. But I haven’t tested it.”
“What about my dagger? You can cut it! It’s just a weak enchantment.”
He eagerly unsheathes his belt knife. I eye it.
“You’re allowed to carry magical artifacts?”
He stares at me.
“Just weak ones. I’m not a child. Hethon cut himself on his first dagger, but I never do.”
Huh. Well, kids learn to hunt. And a belt dagger’s not exactly the worst item. Good thing he’s not that violent or he’d be stabbing kids with it. I hesitate.
“I don’t want to break it.”
“Please? It’s not valuable! Here—I’ll do it for you!”
The young [Lord] dashes forwards. I hold the sword up.
“No, Sammy—don’t—”
