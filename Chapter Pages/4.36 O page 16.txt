Selys and Erin paused as they watched Pisces and Olesm dancing about in the street. Erin shrugged.
“Dunno. They look happy, though. It’s weird seeing them together, isn’t it?”
Selys sniffed.
“Hatchlings are the same wherever you go. Anyways, forget them Erin. You were telling me about the Goblins?”
“Oh, right!”
Erin began walking after Selys, leaving the dancing Pisces and Olesm behind. She sighed.
“It’s a problem. Not them, exactly, but pants.”
“Pants?”
“Yeah, we’re having a real pants crisis. They don’t like them. They want to wear their horrible old loincloths, but I made them get rid of them because they were nasty. Really nasty. But they’d rather walk around naked than with pants…”
“What, really? That’s disg—what do they look like?”
“Selys!”
“I’m just asking.”
“Mrsha lives in my inn!”
“Ooh. Okay, that’s a problem.”
“Yeah. She’s learned they’re a weak spot. And she hates the Goblins. So she keeps throwing things at them. She hit Badarrow right in the groin with a pot the other day, and you know what happens when she doesn’t like something. She bites. I want to avoid that. So if you know any good [Tailors]…”
“Let me introduce you to one right now. Don’t you worry; Aunt Selys is on the job! That’s Aunt Selys for Mrsha, obviously. Don’t call me an Aunt, Erin. It’ll make me feel old.”
“Aw. Can I call you my cousin?”
“Maybe…”
They wandered off. Pisces and Olesm kept dancing, and eventually they stopped. Olesm handed the letter to Pisces, and with a trembling claw, put on the ring.
