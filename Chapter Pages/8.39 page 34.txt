Author’s Note: I wrote chapters like this, back in the day, without multiple days. 20,000 was about the limit for a single ‘writing day’.
As I said, I couldn’t sleep. I’d been having odd sleep, feeling sick, or off. I think I know why. The Kickstarter was a big event I knew was coming up and while I kept working as usual, I was clearly stressed.
Because it does matter. I hope it’s a success and not just because of the money, but because people want a comic based on The Wandering Inn and other stories. But this is the test, isn’t it? Wallets speak louder than words.
…Actually, that doesn’t seem quite right and I’m sure Merdon would object, but you know what I mean. I haven’t checked the Kickstarter yet, but I hope to go past the goal not just based on huge backers, but a lot of people buying the hopefully cheap comic. I know not everyone will want it, but that’s hope for you.
We take chances and sometimes they pay off. It’s all about chances. Good decisions, bad ones…like staying up with about 1 hour of ‘sleep’ to write 10,000 more words. Bah, I wouldn’t have slept anyways.
I may after this. Hopefully, actually. I don’t want to stay up 48 hours. It’s already been…uh…21. The chapter is done and the Kickstarter is out. Thanks for reading. Consider even sharing the Kickstarter, and see you next time.
