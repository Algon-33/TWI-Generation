He pointed and one of the [Knights] jerked back as if struck. The [Knight-Captain] and the Summer’s Champion wheeled their mounts around. They rode towards each other as the [Soldiers] and other [Knights] fell back. Zulv led his Wildfire’s Wrath company at the Order of the Thirsting Veil, clashing with the poisoned weapons of Ailendamus’ champions. Greysten raised his axe.
“[Hill Ogre’s Smash]!”
His first blow knocked his enemy clean from the saddle. The Summer’s Champion was swinging around and riding down on him in the next second. Wildfire’s Wrath was also taking apart the Order of the Thirsting Veil, who hadn’t expected to fight so many [Knights] uninjured.
However, the leftwards charge had stopped dead in its tracks and the [Soldiers] were closing in. Rabbiteater swung his sword, having left his lance behind. He lashed down, his sword carving shoulders and faces. There was no room to use [Grand Slash]. He was just—fighting! He would have pushed further in, but someone grabbed his shoulder.
“Ser Solstice! With me!”
The Goblin jerked. He looked over and saw Dame Voost. The Goblin recalled himself and backed up. He was part of a group. He had been fighting as if he was alone again. But this?
“Summer Knights! To me!”
The [Summer Knights] were pressing in on the middle where Rabbiteater was, but they’d slowed, inevitably, in the press of bodies. Dame Voost recalled all but the front-most ranks. Talia, panting, rode forwards. Chise was unhorsed and moving back, arm hanging limp.
Voost looked around, taking in around sixty [Knights] in their area who’d answered her shout. She pointed.
“We are setting up a second charge! Here! With me! Lances! Ser Solstice—”
She grabbed a spare from a bag of holding and tossed it at him. Greatly surprised, the Goblin saw the [Knights] moving into another wedge, following Dame Voost. She led them forwards in the press of bodies, moving back in order to gain room.
“Trot!”
They barely had twenty feet before the front lines! That was enough, though. The [Knights] moved into a tight formation. Talia glanced at Rabbiteater, expecting the Goblin to get in the way—but he was as well-trained as they were. They moved forwards with the discipline of, well, [Knights].
“Canter!”
Voost was aiming for a thin area of pikes. The Humans were staring at the [Knights] as the fighters drew back, knowing exactly what was going to happen.
“Charge! [Burst of Speed]!”
The Order of Seasons hit the thin wall of [Soldiers] and crashed through with all the momentum of a fresh charge. Rabbiteater saw them tear past terrified faces. The [Summer Knights] were shouting wrath and fury, running down more [Soldiers].
“The archers! There! There, with me!”
Voost swung her sword, and the narrow wedge changed directions. They continued to rampage forwards as they ran past the pikes at last. Rabbiteater looked over his shoulder as he heard another shout. He saw another spear of [Knights] crashing through the side of the [Soldiers] around the Summer’s Champion. He began to understand.

They were just…charging. General Vexil realized his mistake. The Order of Seasons hadn’t lied. They had the means to reach his lines. And once they were there…they couldn’t be stopped.
Individual companies were forming up, mounting charges within his army, building up speed and crashing forwards. His entire plan had been to slow them, but they refused to halt.
A formation was useless if it couldn’t hold! Nor could the Greatbows fire on their own soldiers so easily.
He ordered it anyways.
“Strike them!”
