“Please. But first, talk to me about the Goblins. What the hell was that yesterday? Are you just going to let them form a tribe? Or what? What’s your angle with them?”
Laken frowned.
“They haven’t all run off, if that’s what you mean. But I didn’t lie to them. I will leave them alone. I have hopes for them. But it depends on what they do.”
“Tell me.”
Ryoka leaned forwards. Laken hesitated, and she waited. She wanted to trust him. But every conscious part of her pulled herself back. Trust had been given too freely of late. At last, Laken sighed.
“Well, for one thing, they’re occupying the only good mining spot on my lands. And they have my iPhone until it runs out of charge. And to judge from what I’m seeing—they’re preparing to be attacked. They’re building a base. And here’s what I predict happening if I tweak things right…”
He leaned forwards. Ryoka listened. She blinked.
“That might work. Historically, I mean, there are parallels.”
Laken rolled his closed eyes.
“Oh, lecture me on the parallels. Go ahead.”
Ryoka coughed, embarrassed.
“Sorry. I just meant—that could work. Okay. I believe you. It’s a good plan, at least. But it does depend on the Goblins.”
“They’re people. They might not do what I expect them to. But I’ve given them a chance. That’s all I can do.”
The two sat in silence after that. Ryoka hesitated. She bit her lip. Laken faced ahead. And then he raised his head.
“Oh.”
“Oh? What?”
The [Emperor] hesitated. He bit his lip, and looked rueful. And then focused on Ryoka.
“I forgot to tell you one thing, Ryoka. In the early spring, I summoned the fae. And I met one of them. She called herself Ivolethe. She wanted you to know she’s alive.”
Ryoka stared at Laken. He waited. She was frozen in place. After a minute, he coughed.
“Ryoka?”
She didn’t respond. She’d turned into a statue. Worried, Laken reached out.
“Ry—”
“Ivolethe’s alive?”
Ryoka leapt to her feet. She stared at Laken, white-faced, although he couldn’t have known that. He leaned back.
“Yes—”
He got no further because Ryoka let out a shout that made Gamel open the door. He saw Ryoka dancing around inside, laughing hysterically. Laken shooed Gamel away and the door closed. Ryoka didn’t notice. She laughed and began to sob, and then lost her balance.
Laken waited, surprised. Ryoka was laughing and crying on the floor. She didn’t stop. Her laughter was relieved, wild, hysterical. And eventually, Laken began to laugh as well.
It took a long while for them to stop. At last, Ryoka returned to her seat. Her throat was raw. But she reached out and grabbed Laken’s hands, to his surprise. And he sensed the tears in her voice and eyes.
“You know, I’d forgive you for almost anything for telling me that. Thank you. Thank you. She’s…”
He wished he could see her face. Because every line of her he sensed—Ryoka sat down in the chair again.
Redemption. He didn’t know what had happened between her and Ivolethe. But the City Runner wiped tears from her eyes. So it hurt Laken to deliver the next part of the message.
“She’ll never see you in this world. It’s her punishment, or something.”
Ryoka froze. But after a moment, she replied, quietly unsurprised.
“That’s okay. Maybe I’ll see her in my next life. Or when I die. But at least she’s…alive.”
She sat there with him. Laken waited, but nothing more came from Ryoka. After a while, he began to chuckle again. When Ryoka made an inquiring sound, he shook his head.
“When did it all go so wrong, eh?”
“Yeah. What happened to the Laken I met?”
The [Emperor] paused.
