“It is a curious thing. War. And I realize the north and south are traditionally opposed. However—there are some things I think we can agree on. I’m sorry, I’m rambling. But I really just wanted to attract some attention. Naughty of me, I suppose. But look—”
She pointed. And everyone in the world turned and saw the Antinium.
They marched down the street. A flood of Antinium. Black-bodied Workers, Soldiers. And more.
Xrn the Small Queen strode forwards with Klbkch. And there was Pivr. Xeu. Tersk and Dekass.
And they did not know they were being watched. Lism recoiled as he saw Flying Antinium, stalking Silent Antinium. Armored Antinium and Painted Antinium. Magnolia’s eyes glittered.
“Ancestors! What are those Antinium doing? Those aren’t the Free Antinium!”
Zevara made a strangled sound. She hadn’t seen the other Antinium. Magnolia didn’t look surprised.
“I believe they’re from other Hives.”
Every head turned towards her. Watch Captain Zevara caught herself.
“But—we didn’t see them. And we’ve kept a lookout—”
Her scales turned white. And Magnolia Reinhart’s eyes glittered.
“Imagine that. Pryde, as I recall, your House fought in both Antinium Wars.”
“Of course. And excuse me.”
Pryde walked down the battlements. The [Lady] was staring at the Small Queen. But Xrn wasn’t focused on her.
“You! Stop! Enough!”
She shouted. At a figure standing in the street.
Nalthaliarstrelous. The [Druid] ignored her. His eyes were closed, but there was no sign of what he was doing. At least—obviously. Xrn pointed her staff at him.
Pryde barred Xrn’s way. The Small Queen saw the Lady Ulta standing in front of her. And two figures flanked Pryde.
Ressa and Reynold. The Antinium halted. And Magnolia spoke.
“The Small Queen of the Antinium. Good evening to you.”
Xrn looked up. And her eyes fixed on Montressa, the scrying orb. Klbkch made a sound next to her.
“Kvetch. That is not good.”
“You. Are Magnolia Reinhart. Call off that spellcaster. Now.”
The Small Queen spoke flatly. Magnolia looked at her.
“No. I have never met you, myself. But then I never fought on the front lines. Xrn, I believe your name is?”
“Yes.”
The Small Queen raised her staff. Looking at Nalthaliarstrelous. The [Druid] was unmoving.
“Stop him. Or I will do it.”
“That. Would be war. And I would take that as a personal affront if you tried.”
The [Lady] looked down at Xrn. The Small Queen hesitated.
“Why are you here? We bear you no specific enmity. Nor you us.”
“True. It is nothing personal. But that makes us the best sort of enemies. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in only one thing. And that is unity. I am a [Lady] of Izril. And before politics, before species. I believe we do not stand alone. When an enemy comes, Izril repels it.”
Magnolia Reinhart looked down at the Antinium. And they gazed up at her.
What was the point? Of any of it? To denounce the Antinium? No—show that they were in Liscor? How had she known? But the last piece of puzzle was this. Magnolia waved a hand in Montressa’s face as Nalthaliarstrelous’s head rose.
“How do you turn her off? Excuse me—I’m done.”
“What?”
Montressa blinked. Lism started.
“What did she say?”
“What?”
It was a universal question. But Magnolia Reinhart was snapping her fingers.
“Excuse me, would you mind cutting the spell? I’m quite done. And this distraction is fin—”
The [Scrying] spell cut out. And that was it. There was only silence, as Magnolia turned to Wuvren.
“Time.”
“Go first. I’ll go last.”
