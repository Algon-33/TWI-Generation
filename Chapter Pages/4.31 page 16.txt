The sound was a physical presence. The drumbeats rolled off the hills, a distant thunder. Both Teriarch and Ryoka turned. It was coming from the south. And as Ryoka’s chest constricted, she knew.
“The Goblin Lord.”
“Yes.”
She turned to him, desperate.
“Do something! His army’s coming here!”
“He will pass by the city, I think.”
“It doesn’t matter! You have to do something! The Goblin Lord will destroy everything in his path! He’ll kill people! You have to—”
Again, Teriarch cut her off.
“What would you have me do? Burn them? Destroy their army?”
“Yes!”
“No.”
The Dragon shook his head as Ryoka stared at him. She punched at his chest and he caught her hand effortlessly. He let go of her gently. He looked wretched. And old.
“If I did, then what? One threat would be eliminated, yes. But what about next time? Goblins exist, Ryoka Griffin. So long as they live, there will be Goblin Lords, Goblin Kings. And monsters exist. Would you have me destroy all of them? Every creature that might threaten Human lives? What about Drakes? What if your species went to war, as you do?”
Ryoka opened her mouth. Teriarch went on.
“What then? Should I judge which side is right and destroy the other? Or seal them from attacking each other with a spell? I am no tyrant. But it seems that to save anyone, I must become one. No. If I move for one case, I should do the same for all. And I will not.”
“But they’re right here. In front of you! If you see something evil happening in front of you, what’s your excuse for not doing anything?”
Ryoka stared at Teriarch. He could stop it all. The Dragon looked back at her and shook his head again.
“Stop what evil? I see no evil.”
“The Goblins—”
“Are a people like your kind and mine. They are as innocent as any race. Perhaps more so than others. That they are considered monsters is no fault of theirs. How else would a species hated by all others survive, if not to become the thing they are hated for? No.”
“They killed. I saw them. They killed Mrsha’s tribe. They killed children.”
Ryoka sank to her knees in the snow. She was crying again. Teriarch bent over her. His hands were warm.
“Yes. And I am sorry.”
For a long time they stood there, an old Dragon and a young woman. One with all the power to change things and the other with nothing at all. Then Ryoka stood.
“I’m leaving.”
He was surprised.
“Where to?”
“Anywhere. Not here. Not with the Goblin Lord—”
“What about your friends? Those you want to protect?”
Ryoka shook her head. She felt so, so very empty.
“They don’t want me. Not right now. And I don’t deserve them. It feels like every time I get involved with them, they die. So…I’m leaving. I can’t do anything anyways. I’m too weak.”
She turned and began walking back towards the inn as the Goblin Lord’s drums beat on. Teriarch walked with her.
“Just like that? Where will you go? What will you do?”
“What I’m good at. Run. And I’ll do it somewhere far from here, where the only person I can get killed is myself. Somewhere where the wind blows strong. Far away.”
She felt the Dragon hesitate. He walked next to her, staring down at Ryoka. She stopped at the inn and looked inside. Erin was serving the Horns of Hammerad. Ryoka put her hand on the glass and turned away. Teriarch watched her walk over to the door and put her hand on it.
“You are going now?”
“Yeah. I’m going to go to Celum and…somewhere else. I know you don’t want to be seen. So—goodbye.”
She turned to him and held out a hand. Teriarch touched it gingerly. He took her hand and shook it.
“I am sorry.”
“Sorry doesn’t fix things.”
“No.”
