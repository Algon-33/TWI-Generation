Erin stood in the field afterwards. The ground was muddy and broken feathers from one of her pillows were spread about. Wherever she looked she saw muddy, dirty people. But smiles. Erin looked around and grinned. She saw Mrsha riding on Moore’s shoulders, Bevussa drinking from a cup that never ran dry, and Headscratcher standing among the Goblins as they surrounded him, cheering their hero. Erin smiled and turned to Ceria. The half-Elf smiled at her.
“A nice day?”
“A nice day. And a good game.”
The two smiled at each other. Erin held out a hand and Ceria placed something in it. A baseball. Worn, dirty, the hide cover torn off in one spot. Erin stared at it.
“Baseball’s sort of fun, isn’t it?”
“Just a bit.”
Erin nodded. She tossed the ball up and down and then shrugged.
“I still like chess better. Hey, you wanna eat dinner?”
“I thought you’d never ask.”
