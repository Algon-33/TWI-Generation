“I was being careful. I know you went with Eldavin—who wouldn’t? Honestly, Troy…Amerys is just dangerous. I was being cautious—and we still are. But you and I make our choices and we can’t go back. So let’s not speak of that. Not yet. How are your studies going?”
“Good…I don’t quite like barrier spells, though. They give me a headache.”
“Keeping it up? I understand. You get nosebleeds. What spell did you learn first?”
“[Light Barrier].”
“Naturally, naturally. Er, you do know you can sneeze on that spell hard enough and break it? Well, that is what that amulet is for. How did you get that?”
“Archmage Nailihuaile gave it to me.”
Viltach’s brows shot up.
“So that’s why she…ah, we do have more to talk about. Do you have long?”
Trey checked the timepiece set on one of Viltach’s tables. He looked out the window at the fading light.
“I have a bit, Archmage.”

Calac Crusland met Tov and Goelv in his rooms. They were waiting for Emirea and Trey.
“You’re early. He won’t be here for another hour.”
“I cannot stay in my rooms. I am nervous. Th—where is Gazi Pathseeker?”
Goelv whispered after the door was closed. Calac met his gaze briefly, and Tov settled with his back to the wall, watching the door.
“In her place.”
“She won’t be with us?”
“She’ll meet us at the Creler-mural. She has to go undetected.”
“Hm. Right. So…we’re doing this.”
Calac nodded. He looked at Goelv and Tov, and took a breath.
“You’re both in. I never asked you why. Was Troy that convincing?”
The two young men looked at him. Goelv half shook his head.
“Troy? He is a friend, but…that is Gazi Pathseeker. She knows more about magic and our people—even as a half-Gazer—she’s Gazi Pathseeker.”
He said it as if it said everything, and it did. Tov was different. He just stared at Calac.
“She serves the King of Destruction. A living legend. I…”
He hesitated. The Drowned Man rubbed at his slug half.
“Greatness. Greatness lies in that, and I’d be part of a legend. I could say I helped free Amerys. And I will be rewarded, won’t I?”
Calac Crusland nodded. He opened and closed his hands. He had seen the news about the siege of Reim this morning. The speculation.
One more hour, and they’ll know Amerys has returned. One more hour and the King of Destruction can threaten them with her wrath. She might even reach Chandrar if she can teleport—
“You have my vow as a Crusland.”
Tov just nodded, then frowned.
“Who is he?”
“Who? Crusland? My father is—”
“No. Who is Troy? Why does the King of Destruction trust him so much he sent him? You, I understand. But who is…he?”
The Drowned Man frowned, looking at Calac and then at Goelv. He was surprised by Calac’s smile.
“That would take too long to explain. You can ask him yourself.”
Tov gestured at the window.
“We’ve over an hour left.”
“It would still take too long.”
Still, since they were here, Calac began to explain. He waited for Emirea and Trey, checking the sinking sun.
The others. Were they in position?

“Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty…thirty-one…”
Elena was counting the Earthers preparing for their breakout. She didn’t see Troy, but he had told her he’d catch up.
“George? You’re coming?”
She stopped one of the young men entering. The Earther grinned at her, shamefaced.
“I wasn’t sure, but I talked it over and everyone’s coming. Saif, Eun—we’re packed and ready.”
“Does anyone suspect anything? Sidney?”
The little girl was clinging to Basil’s hand as he walked into the room. The [Smelter] was shaking.
“We’re all going. If you’re going.”
They were a group. George nodded at the door.
