The word spread from the inn. Into the city of Liscor. Into the Walled City of Inventions. To Celum, Esthelm, where a Dwarf abandoned his forge. To the City of Adventurers, missing the [Actors] who heard it only on the road. A Vampire girl grabbed the person who had cried it, protesting that it could not be so.
Across the continent. Catching an Earl as he waited for a game of chess. He turned back, disbelieving.
In the city by the Flood Plains, the people who heard it shook their heads. An incredulous laugh, a cold stare. That wasn’t funny.
What did you say? The Human, dead? Erin? You had to be mad.
It could not be. You were mistaken. Be silent.
Not like that. Not—a petty little raiding party. Not Hectval.
They dropped what they were doing. They abandoned their tasks. They found friends. Family. They walked out of the city. Climbing the hill, and seeing the scene play itself out and turning truth into shards of reality.
She lay there, on the grass. Unmoved as people knelt or reached out to touch her, held back. A city stopped in disbelief. As if so many people could turn time back and make fact reverse.
How did you remember someone? It was not in how they died, or the funeral.
It was what they left behind. Who remembered them. Erin Solstice lay there, her fingers on one hand still extended slightly. Holding out her will.
The fire was dead. And her friends and guests and family stood there.
It wasn’t right. It wasn’t fair. And they said the same things all people said. The same words. As disbelief turned to grief. As they waited for the young woman to rise and laugh.
She did not.

The sky fell away. Hours slipping into evening. The world changed.
They knelt, in front of her. Out of order. Trying to speak. Some wordless.

“Silver and steel be my guide. Everything dies. But not…not you. Not here. Not this way.”
Ylawes Byres clenched his hand until his gauntlets dripped blood. He had not been there. Dawil’s face was a mask of tears. Falene was shaking too hard to speak. She leaned on the Dwarf as he gently placed his helmet down before her, on the frozen ground.
“Grandfathers take you to the next adventure, Erin Solstice. May it be a better one.”
“She’s not dead. She can’t be—”
Dawil took Falene’s arm. The [Knight] stared ahead.

“What have they done? What have we done?”
Ratici was held back only by Wilovan. Their hats were off. They looked around for someone—but the Drakes were dead. They had been relaxing. They had not been here.

Seborn said nothing. No matter how long he knelt. Jelaqua was screaming. Ulinde—she looked up as Moore spoke at last.
“Those who slew you will end. Then—I will protect the little ones.”
He turned away. The half-Giant stared at his hands. He clenched them. He had been able to do nothing.

“I thought I was strong.”
Fierre mumbled. She stood with Alber. She had found him. She had been going to show him to—the [Fistfighter] looked at the body and turned away. Fierre was trembling.
“Wh—wh—I thought I was strong. I thought—what am I supposed to tell Ryoka?”
“Fierre.”
“It’s not right.”

“No.”
Grimalkin of Pallass looked down. He looked around. Searching for—
“No.”

“Erin! Get up! You can’t—”
Selys was being held back by Ishkr. Drassi. They heard the howling voices. The shouting. The hilltop was removed from all of it. Selys screamed.
“Erin!”
Tekshia shook her head. She looked at Erin like so many before. She leaned on her staff, silent.

More and more. They came for the door. The Watch Captain. Adventurers. [Mages].
