“No. And no again! I said no! I won’t go. I have duties here. I can’t leave! I don’t care what the others say. Tell them no!”
“Come!”
The raven was insistent. Wiskeria glowered. She grabbed at something on the ground. A piece of soil. She hurled it and a show of dirt sent the crow flying.
“No! Begone and tell her no!”
This time the bird didn’t reply. It took flight. Wiskeria glared as it flew off. Durene followed it with her eyes and then saw the [Witch] walking towards where the raven had been. Durene walked closer and saw Wiskeria was bending over. Brushing at some dirt that had gotten on top of a grave. She was so engrossed she didn’t notice Durene at first. Then she looked up. Durene was hard to miss.
“Durene?”
Wiskeria’s pale face went paler. Durene looked down at her. The [Witch] was thin. Thinner than Durene remembered her. But still the same.
“Wiskeria. It’s me.”
Durene felt silly saying it out loud. But Wiskeria seemed as shocked to see Durene as the Troll girl was to see her. The [Witch] opened her mouth and hesitated. She looked at Durene’s tunic and her eyes widened as she saw the scar on her chest.
“Your injury—”
Durene reflexively covered the wound. Then she stopped. Wiskeria had been the one to save her, according to Prost.
“Yeah. I was asleep. Sick, apparently. I’ve been…asleep.”
“I know. I kept coming to see you. Do you remember?”
“No.”
“Oh. Well…it’s good to see you.”
Wiskeria tugged on the brim of her hat. She looked around, almost unsteadily. Then back up at Durene.
“I’m so glad.”
She reached out and caught herself, withdrew the hand. Durene blinked. Wiskeria wasn’t like this. She remembered a confident, no-nonsense person. Not whoever this was.
“I’m glad to see you too. What was…that?”
She pointed vaguely in the direction of the crow. Wiskeria turned her head.
“That? Oh—a message. From a…friend.”
“Really?”
Durene had no idea you could train crows to send messages. But then, Wiskeria was a [Witch]. Wasn’t that what they did? Durene knew of [Witches] as scary, mysterious people. Riverfarm had never had one around, but you heard rumors. But Wiskeria had been so normal when she’d shown up as part of the Celestial Trackers that Durene had hardly given it a second thought what with everything else happening. Now?
“I’m glad.”
Wiskeria repeated herself. She wavered. And then she looked around.
“Sorry. It’s such a surprise. I’ve been…did you just wake up? Are you here to pay your respects?”
“I guess. I mean, I am.”
Embarrassed, Durene realized that must have been why Wiskeria was here. And the [Witch] looked so solemn, so pained, so sad that Durene felt callous by comparison. Wiskeria nodded a few times.
“I’ve been here. Most days. Thinking about my—what happened. I try to do it now, when no one’s about. They come after sunset. The families, you know.”
“Are all these people who died in the battle?”
Durene gestured around the graveyard. Wiskeria shook her head.
“They’re also your folk who died before that. But most of them come from the battle. This isn’t all of them either. The rest were buried in their homes. If they still remained. I…I saw to that.”
She bit her lip and looked down. Durene stared at her. She looked around the cemetery again.
“What have you been doing? Besides this?”
“Besides…?”
Wiskeria looked blank. She stared around and shook her head.
“Laken’s gone. I haven’t gotten any orders from him. Well—Rie and Prost keep in contact. But he’s coming back. With Goblins. You heard about that?”
Durene gritted her teeth.
“I did. What do you think about it?”
