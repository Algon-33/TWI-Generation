“Here! On me!”
Zevara had already seen them. Grimalkin spotted the distant shapes. He raced towards them with the Gold-rank adventurers. They slowed, staring.
The Watch approached the figures standing amid the dead. Watch Captain Zevara, Wing Commander Embria—they saw the fallen bodies. The broken ice and ivory. But they had only eyes for them.
Adventurers. Less than a dozen. They stood—stood, because they were too tired to sit. Stood, because they had refused to fall. Not one was uninjured. They barely moved as their rescuers stared. Grimalkin stepped forwards. He saw a head turn. A moving throat, whispered words. Grimalkin nodded. He reached out and caught the half-Elf as she collapsed.
“Who—who is this team? Who did this?”
The Gold-rank Gnoll demanded. She looked at the adventurers. At the Frostmarrow Behemoth’s fading remains. At the dead Crelers. Grimalkin knelt, reaching for an antidote.
“The Horns of Hammerad.”

Never. It screamed at her, you will never stop us! We will eat the world! For that is why we were made! You have not seen what gives us our charge! You have no idea of what lies dreaming!
But it died. And she laughed and laughed. Because it never understood. She sensed it dying, uncomprehending. It was all hunger and malice. It understood nothing of sacrifice. Nothing of how to die well. She reached up, wondering if she would see them again.
Her arms—she thought she could feel them. Yvlon Byres smiled, relieved there was something else. Something—
Someone was calling her name. Reaching for her. Shaking her. Telling her she had to wake up. Voices were screaming at her, telling her—Yvlon fixed on the one voice. But her arms—her body.
It didn’t matter. For him, for them she could bear it. So she reached back, pulling. And still, she felt—
“Please, you must wake up. Or else, why would I live? Please?”
Yvlon opened her eyes. And when she did, he was still holding her. She looked up. And she met Ksmvr’s eyes.
“Ksmvr?”
He froze. Yvlon stared up at him.
“Yvlon?”
She thought she was still dying. Yvlon had to be. Because she felt—she looked up at him.
“What? I thought I was—”
“She’s awake! She’s alive!”
Someone screamed. Yvlon stared at Ksmvr. The world came back. She realized she was not staring at the sky, but a ceiling. And Ksmvr—he was bandaged. His antennae was torn. But he was alive. The woman tried to move. And she realized she could.
She was alive. But—she couldn’t be. Yvlon remembered. She remembered the wound she’d taken. Her arm. She looked up at Ksmvr.
“You are alive.”
He told her. She tried to smile. But she was blinking away tears. Let it be. For him, she’d try. She tried to raise her head. Her friends were shouting her name. But she looked at Ksmvr. She was afraid to look down.
“I couldn’t leave you behind, my little friend.”
“You did not.”
The woman tried to smile.
“My arm. And my back—I—I’m going to have to rely on you from now on, Ksmvr. Okay?”
The Antinium looked at her. Yvlon wanted to reach for his face. He trembled.
“Why? Are you going to die, Yvlon?”
“No. No, but my arms—both of them—”
“What about them? They are very pretty.”
Yvlon paused. Ksmvr looked at her, tilting his head, confused. And she realized something. She could feel his hands. His three hands, so tenderly holding her shoulder. Her right arm. Her left. She hesitated. She could feel his touch. But it felt different.
And then it hit her. Words that screamed in her very soul. She hadn’t heard them. But now they echoed again.
