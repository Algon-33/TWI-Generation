“Skills and magic don’t work, Human. Not sure why they locked you up more than our leader; someone must really not like you. Where did you cause trouble?”
“No clue. I’m innocent, I said. Where…where’s Magistrate…Ducaz? My gear?”
That was all her reference. The [Bandits] looked at each other. One shrugged.
“Never heard of him. You must have been shuttled with us. So—[Sailor]? Insulted someone you shouldn’t have?”
More grins. Yvlon looked around and saw…well, [Bandits]. String People, yes, their bodies made of cloth, sewn together, a bit hodgepodge. She was used to Revi, who had a good, quality cotton body, such that she looked like any woman until you noticed her stitching.
These [Storm Bandits] were different. They clearly assembled their bodies out of whatever they could get. So some of their ‘skin’ was rough, even more close to hide than skin. Hemp fabric. Other parts were beautiful, supple limbs…connected to a rougher torso, less well-proportioned.
The entire effect was like looking at patchwork people, which is what they were. Only Merr, their leader, looked good. Stunning, in fact; she must have had access to the best limbs.
“…I said, what did you do? Answer!”
A foot kicked Yvlon. The [Bandits] were interrogating her and the [Thief]. Yvlon glowered at the [Bandit].
“I was abducted by a [Magistrate] who tried to force me to give him my possessions. Then I…resisted.”
She hesitated. The [Bandit] raised her brows.
“Resisted?”
There were snorts from the other riders, including Merr. Yvlon glowered around.
“I didn’t kill anyone. I think. I’m not a [Bandit]. I’m an adventurer.”
She glowered at Merr, who was giving her a sardonic look. Another [Bandit] roughly jammed her shoulder into Yvlon’s arm—then winced as she hit the metal without much effect.
“Eyes down. You’re speaking to—”
“A [Bandit]. I’m an adventurer. Now, someone tell me where we are.”
The [Bandits] weren’t impressed. If anything, Yvlon’s occupation just made them more hostile. One sneered.
“An adventurer. We eat your kind for breakfast. What are you, Silver-rank? Bronze?”
Merr laughed behind her gag and raised her shackles. She couldn’t speak, but her hand made a few gestures Yvlon’s way to say what she thought about Yvlon’s job.
The bound [Armsmistress] tried to move, but her hand was shackled to her ankles, which meant she could only move by some kind of horrible hopping if it came to that. She glared around, losing what little patience she’d gained by being knocked out.
“I’m Gold-rank. Yvlon Byres. And if I had my arm free, we’d see who ate whom.”
As threats went, it was probably worse than what Ksmvr could have come up with. And Yvlon had once heard him threaten someone by saying, ‘I would like you to imagine I am threatening you horribly, please’. To be fair, he also had the mandibles for a really aggressive lean-in.
Yet it seemed the [Storm Bandits] knew Yvlon after all, because her mentioning her exact rank made them suddenly draw back. The [Bandit] across from her suddenly went pale and edged back. So did everyone else.
“Wait. You’re the Gold-rank that tore up half the city? I thought it was that half-Giant!”
The [Thief] was practically on Merr’s lap. The other [Bandits]—even Merr—looked uneasy.
“I didn’t tear up half a city. I’m innocent!”
Yvlon protested. The [Bandits] gave her clearly-skeptical looks.
“The [Judiciary] sentenced you with the deaths of nearly two dozen [Guards]! The report they read said you killed twice that many civilians! Hacked them up!”
“What? What? I didn’t do that!”
