No. For once, he longed to watch the second movie. The little computer screen glowed in front of him. The Dragon eyed…the mutated slime-thing. That was apparently a Troll.
But what was the fun of watching a movie alone? Some fun. But that had been…pleasant. He sat there, the Dragon. And realized something.
He had never seen a movie before. Brilliant plays, yes, and dramas, magical wonders. But that had been new.
“One hundred and two points. Minus eighty points for the false Dragon.”
The Dragon murmured. He closed his eyes. And then slowly opened them. Something was peculiar.
He was…awake. He had woken up. The Dragon blinked a few times. And sighed.
Those little girls. This one had been something. He closed his eyes. And realized something else.
“…I forgot to tell her how to appease the Fae.”
Route J. In which Ryoka Griffin teleports out of Teriarch’s cave. Without getting her reward.

The first wagon rumbled into Celum. Carrying a door. Wailant had his horses moving fast. And Erin Solstice, bumping around, just…stared at Celum.
“Oh no.”
It was destroyed. The [Innkeeper] slowly got down from the wagon.
“Back it up! Any [Raiders] about?”
The former [Pirate] was nervous as he looked around. Garia and Viceria weren’t at the farm. Erin slowly swung the door open. Two figures jumped down, warily.
Relc and Pisces. They’d come with the wagon. Embria was riding with some of 4th Company. And as Erin wrestled with the magic door—Relc pulled it out of the wagon and set it up with one claw.
“4th Company! Secure the area! Watch for invisible or concealed targets! Or traps!”
Embria bellowed. The wary Drakes spread around. Erin just stared as the door opened and Viceria gasped. The inn was full of people.
“Dead fucking gods. I’ve sacked ports, but we took the loot, not torched…”
Wailant muttered. Erin was shouting through the door.
“Bring them through! Hurry!”
“Adventurers first!”
Yvlon stepped through the door and stopped. She just stared around. The Halfseekers followed her, nearly running her over. Jelaqua swore.
“Bloodfeast bastards. They struck again.”
“Who—who are you?”
A nervous [Commander] from Remendia stared at Erin and the magical door. She looked at him.
Humans were here. Several hundred; trying to find survivors. But it was uncoordinated. They hadn’t brought supplies.
And Celum’s people were shell shocked. It was night, and there were too many hands, not enough organization. Erin Solstice heard voices.
“I’m Erin Solstice. [Innkeeper]. We’re with Liscor. Esthelm.”
“Liscor? But that’s a Drake city.”
The man stared blankly at her. Then he focused.
“Wait. The Wandering Inn? Aren’t you—”
He broke off as someone marched through the door. Watch Captain Zevara saluted as the Human [Commander] recoiled.
“Watch Captain Zevara of Liscor. As a neighboring city, Liscor’s Council has voted with majority to support Celum in its time of need. As well as investigate claims of a Drake among the Bloodfeast Raiders. I am representing the Drake cities in this, sir.”
“Oh. Uh—hello.”
The [Commander] saluted. Erin nodded. The vote had been 6-2. Even Lism had done the right thing.
But perhaps that was because of the [Strategist] who marched through after Zevara.
“Strategist Olesm of Liscor. We’ll be assisting the recovery effort. What’s the situation, Commander…?”
“Uh—we’ve been pulling bodies out of the wreckage. But we don’t know how many are wounded or…I’ve never seen a city like this. Even when we had Gargoyle attacks, it wasn’t like this.”
The man looked around helplessly. Olesm looked at Zevara.
