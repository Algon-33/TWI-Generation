“That’s all I heard, Revi. Halrac, I think a lot of Windrest is there. Riverfarm was hit by the Goblins and the fires too, but—they did better than any other area. There was a plague in the Radivaek lands. But…”
“I see.”
“It’s not far to there. We could check on them.”
Revi suggested. Halrac paused.
“I’ll—send a [Message] first. I know someone from the village. Master Helm—the [Blacksmith] and [Village Head]. If he’s alive…but we have careers.”
This was an adventuring team. Everyone nodded, but—family also came first. Home too. Revi didn’t have any stakes in Izril, but if they’d been in Chandrar? Well, she wouldn’t have asked her team to fight in a war.
Even so.
“You know, there was that interesting job request from Riverfarm. I can find it. I thought it was funny—it was that one that didn’t offer anything but pittance and deferred payment. Hold on.”
Briganda put Cade in Revi’s arms. The Stitch-Woman stared at the boy, curled up, as Briganda got up and looked about. Halrac was just sitting there.
“I think most of them got out, Halrac.”
“Yeah. Thanks for telling me.”
That was all the [Scout] said. And as Revi tried to rock Cade, unsure of what to do, she felt it.
The Players of Celum. Invrisil. The door, coming soon. The Assassin’s Guild on the rise. Riverfarm. A day of fun and relaxation and sudden worry and shock—
Halted. And ceased to matter. Because the adventurers felt it.
Something, running through the city. A chill on Revi’s cloth-skin. She stopped, as Cade yawned. And Halrac and Briganda shot up.
“[Dangersense].”
They chorused as one. The Players of Celum looked up as the adventurers shot out of their seats. Eltistiman grabbed his wand, covering the door. Halrac swung his bow up as Revi put Cade on the table.
“Summons out, Revi—”
“More [Assassins]?”
“No. It’s distant. Something’s—”
A bell began to toll. Everyone in the inn looked up.
“That’s a city-wide alarm. The Watch has felt it.”
Eltistiman breathed. Halrac looked around.
“Jasi! Wesle, take care of Cade.”
“Got it. What are you—”
“Griffon Hunt, with me!”
Halrac ran out of the door. The three adventurers ran after him. Eltistiman stayed with the Players. And Revi looked around.
“Get to the walls! Find the Watch!”
The adventurers ran as everyone else shouted, or panicked or ran for what they thought was safety. But Gold-ranks ran into fire. They saw more adventurers in the streets. Some, Silver-ranks, were hesitating. But Gold-ranks?
The Glitterblades raced out of the Adventurer’s Guild late into the night. They pointed.
“That way!”
Someone was blowing a horn, signaling the area the danger was coming from. Adventurers ran. They passed by the Watch. And Invrisil had a large Watch, well-armed. Not the kind that fought with the criminal underworld, though.
And not prepared..
For this. Revi climbed the eastern walls and stopped. She stared. And Halrac’s [Dangersense]—Briganda’s—no wonder it had gone off.
Her stitches moved. Her cloth-skin crawled. Revi looked up. And she beheld the shadow walking towards Invrisil. A vast thing. A giant.
“Dead gods. What is that?”
Someone breathed. The adventurers looked at each other.
“It’s a giant. An actual Giant or—I can’t see! Halrac!”
They turned to him. The [Scout] was aiming his bow, staring through the darkness.
“It’s some kind of Golem. It’s—made of—flesh.”
Everyone turned to him. And then they stared up at the thing. It had to be at least fifty feet tall. Taller than even the half-Giants. Revi’s skin was crawling.
“Flesh?”
“I see—faces.”
