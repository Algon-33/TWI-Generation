Later that day, Relc and Klbkch walked towards the inn. They stopped when they saw the signs planted deep in the snow.
 
Female main characters for proper pay and time off! Striking until we get vacations!
Free our heroines! No stabbing for all!
I want a pay raise!
 
Relc turned to Klbkch.
“Looks like they’re on strike. Want to go back and wait?”
Klbkch shrugged.
“That appears to be the only sound course of action.”
Relc hesitated. He stared at the inn. He could hear Erin and Ryoka inside, shouting some kind of protest.
“Should we tell them they’re only alive until the real main character shows up?”
Klbkch shook his head.
“I believe that would be unwise.”
The two began walking back towards Liscor, though the snow. Relc started complaining after a few minutes.
“What kind of name is ‘The Wandering Inn’, anyways? The inn doesn’t even move!”
Klbkch agreed. He gestured to his new body with one of his arms.
“I object to my death by the Goblins as well. I feel I should at least have died to twice their number. My reputation is at stake.”
“And I got my ass handed to me by Gazi while Erin gets the final blow. Again.”
“To be fair, Rags got the kill for Skinner.”
“Oh, so I get upstaged by a human girl and a Goblin? I feel much better about that.”
The two walked on in a huff as lightning began pouring from the sky and striking The Wandering Inn. After a second, Relc turned to Klbkch.
“…Do you think we get hazard pay?”
