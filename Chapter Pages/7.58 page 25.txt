“1st Army of Pallass, 4th Battalion. Alchemy’s Arbalests at your service, Strategist Olesm. Grand Strategist Chaldion has placed us under your command.”
Olesm nodded. He stared past the battalion.
“You—moved through an entire battalion?”
Grimalkin snorted.
“Mana is not an object to a Walled City. You have six hundred lives at your disposal, Strategist. Miss Solstice bought them, somehow. Do not waste them. Or die. The [Assassins] will target officers.”
He eyed the second group mixing with the professional Pallassian [Soldiers].
“Is that Liscor’s Watch?”
“And Esthelm’s militia. And Celum’s…will you take command, Magus?”
Grimalkin shook his head.
“I’ll ambush the [Assassins]. Hold this street. And be warned—I am counting hundreds of hostiles. [Superior Camouflage]. [Perfect Muffle]. [Invisibility]—”
He vanished. Olesm turned.
“Begin fortifying the street! I want anti-magic barricades and staggered formation! Commander—our job is to get a City Runner out of the city.”
“They have the streets leading up to the Guild. Are we digging in here before advancing?”
“Yes. We’re not alone.”

“Drakes. In Invrisil. An army of them.”
“Lord Toldos—please retreat behind the van.”
The Human [Soldiers] and [Knights] were fighting down the street. Lord Toldos saw House Sanito’s retainers fighting alongside his men and three other Houses. No Lord Alman. The [Innkeeper] had told him she had asked only for men.
Lord Alman had a family. The old [Lord] refused to move.
“House Everight ends with me. And I will not cower or flee Invrisil twice. Advance!”
He plunged forwards. Ahead of the Drakes, ignoring his retainer’s cries to stop. The [Lord] slashed down a fleeing shadow. The Guild was so close—
The street erupted in fire. An [Assassin] with a staff pointed down at the [Lord]. Toldos raised his sword. He hacked down more [Assassins] as they leapt from cover. His retainers shouted. They tried to advance under a sudden crossfire.
Lord Toldos felt something strike him in the chest, piercing through his armor. He clutched at the shaft. Ah. So that was why she had been weeping. And still—he lifted his sword.
“Forwards!”

Wilovan clutched at his side. One street clear. The city was erupting into violence. He stared down at the dead gang. And then looked around.
The Brothers had lost members. Some were wounded. Others…
“Teor? Where did you go? T—”
He had been right behind Wilovan. The Gnoll turned. He saw a young man, lying face-down on the street. Wilovan reached down.
“Teor?”
He looked into glassy, empty eyes. In the first minute—Wilovan straightened.
“The good folk are rising, and we’re off to our beds. The smart thieves away with the loot and the slow ones are dead.”
There was nothing to say. She had asked. There were more gangs than he had imagined, that was all. The Guild had sent their [Assassins] into the city in force.
“Next street. Where’s Miss Griffin? Ratici?”
“With us. I think—there are [Soldiers] falling back. Their first assault went south.”
“Which species?”
“Human.”
“We’ll see if we can’t finesse it, then. Lads? Anyone who can move, with me.”
“What are you doing?”
The City Runner stared at Wilovan. Ratici joined his companion. Wilovan gave her a nod. He didn’t pick up his hat. Crimshaw appeared, limping. He had the tricorne. Teor’s. He placed it over the young man’s head.
They left him behind. Wilovan walked on.
“Going for a walk, Miss Griffin. Let’s set you on your way.”
“This is madness. They’re killers.”
So are we. But it was true—the [Assassins] were ready to die. Wilovan reached for the hat and felt the lightness on his head.
