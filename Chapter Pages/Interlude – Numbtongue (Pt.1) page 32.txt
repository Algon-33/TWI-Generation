Interlude – Numbtongue (Pt.1)
Page 32
And Numbtongue looked at Yellow Splatters and the Hob saw Soldier’s antennae flicker for a moment, his mandibles open, and his posture stiffen—and then relax. And the looseness of the way he lifted his mandibles, the opening and shutting of his hands—all of it was different, but familiar. The Soldier nodded at last.
“I would be grateful to do so. But I am tasked with a duty. I must clear the Shield Spiders another hour yet. I cannot abandon my post. Or my Soldiers.”
He looked at Numbtongue. And Yellow Splatters felt regret. The Hobgoblin nodded as if it were the most natural thing in the world. He eyed the Painted Soldiers, the destroyed Shield Spider nests, and then he turned to Yellow Splatters.
“Want help?”
And the Soldier hesitated, and then smiled. He saw the green clawed hand extend. And this time the Antinium took the Goblin’s hand. The monster looked at the monster. And for once, neither found they needed to explain. They were dissimilar, from the color their bodies to their class and their species and their purpose. One stood alone. The other had been made to be different.
And yet, the two had something. A connection. They had been there. They had seen the same battlefield. They had lost. They understood each other. They…understood each other.
It made the world feel like a different place.
