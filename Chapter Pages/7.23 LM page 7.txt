“So—we have a lot to talk about. Why don’t you take a seat? And have breakfast? We’ve got sausages, eggs on toast, tomatoes.”
“Oh yes! From home!”
Instantly, the group lit up ecstatically. They sat next to Lyonette’s table. And the convivial atmosphere of the morning changed for Lyonette.
She and Drassi served the food. She heard them exclaiming in relief.
“Proper food. Not like what we’ve eaten sometimes. Thank you so much—do you have waffles? Or pancakes? I’ve been dying to have some…”
Galina was talking to Erin. The young woman blinked a few times.
“I mean, we do, but—”
“Can I get bacon?”
Kevin practically shouted. Joseph swore and covered his ears. Leon’s head rose.
“Wait—do you have hamburgers? I saw that on the menu, but someone ate mine.”
He glared at Joseph. Erin hesitated.
“We…have them. But—”
“Can we get them? I mean, it’s from home.”
The others gave Erin a pleading look. Lyonette sighed as Erin turned to her.
“Coming up. Who wants a hamburger?”
“No lettuce on mine.”
Troydel instantly raised his hand. Lyonette paused—and sighed. She went into the kitchen and came back.
“I can’t believe this. You have an inn! How did you get it? Did you find it? I mean—I remember us meeting way back when, but this is incredible! Do you own it? Really?”
Rose was chatting to Erin. The young woman nodded, watching Kevin bite into his cheeseburger and sigh. Mrsha’s head poked over the table, narrow-eyed.
“I did. I mean—the first inn wasn’t mine. But I fixed it up and I run it. That’s my class. [Innkeeper].”
“Whoa. So you’re in this world. Really? And you work here?”
Kevin looked up. Erin looked at Numbtongue. The Goblin was eying the Earthers who didn’t seem bothered by him, just—fascinated. Galina and Rose were staring at him and whispering and so was Leon, muttering about a videogame to Troydel.
“…no tusks…but they have Minotaurs, man…”
The lack of fear so much as naked curiosity bothered the Hobgoblin [Bard]. He slowly edged away from his table until he was sitting with the Horns of Hammerad. Ceria realized her eyes were also the focus of much staring.
“Just insane. Wild. We were at Magnolia’s mansion the entire time. Which sucked. Right until the [Assassins] attacked—what’s your level?”
Joseph had recovered with the food enough to join in asking questions. Even Erin was wincing and looking around.
“Lower your voice. We can talk about that later.”
“What? Oh—right. Well, we came all the way here looking for you. Ryoka said you had an inn, but we didn’t know you had a magic door! That’s nuts.”
Erin exhaled. Lyonette and Mrsha both looked up sharply.
Ryoka. The [Innkeeper] spoke carefully.
“Ryoka. Yeah, she sent all of you. She sent me a letter. But I didn’t know you were…uh…coming. Where is she? Is she okay? Why did she send you all?”
Lyonette nodded. She came over and the others looked at her. Rose hesitated.
“Ryoka? Well—she arrived just before the—[Assassins]. She took our electronics. All of them. And she told us to come here since Magnolia’s estates were under attack.”
The two young women waited, but Rose was done. Erin looked at Lyonette helplessly.
“…Nothing more?”
“Well—she said your inn wasn’t always safe, but you’d take us in. She was really busy. She had this boxer-friend who hated our guts, but she hired some adventurers to escort us south. We weren’t in Reizmelt long.”
“Reizmelt. So Ryoka’s there?”
The [Princess]’s hands tightened on the tabletop. Mrsha looked at Rose. The young woman, oblivious to the hidden emotion, nodded.
“Yeah. They call her the Wind Runner of Reizmelt. She can command the wind. Didn’t you know?”
