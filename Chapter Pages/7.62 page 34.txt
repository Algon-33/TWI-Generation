Alone—she galloped behind the formations of Drakes. She saw their heads turning as their neat little rows of poised [Soldiers] turned. The Kaalblade ignited in her hand. She swept it down—
The glowing arc of magic beheaded Drakes as the [Lady] rode down the line of a battalion. The [Soldiers] didn’t notice her at first. How would an enemy [Rider] have gotten past them? They thought she was a messenger at first—
Then they saw the toppling heads as she held the Kaalblade out at head-height. Drakes screamed, throwing themselves down. Maviola hacked through a spear and half of a Drake’s head—
The artifact went dead. Cursing, she drew the spent mana stone and yanked another one out of her bag of holding. The blade ignited again, nearly taking off her fingers. The [Lady] swung it as she rode towards Olesm. Fire spouted in her wake, sowing more chaos in Hectval’s lines.

“They’re charging in! Burn them to pieces! [Fireball] volley! On my mark!”
The [High Mage] ignored the arrows bouncing off the barricades and the fighting around her mage group. She was aiming at the [Strategist]. She lifted her staff—heard a panicked shout.
“Incoming magic!”
“Where? They don’t have that many m—”
The bolt of lightning detonated overhead. The [Mages] flinched—another one struck from the skies. The [High Mage] turned.
“Enemy spellcaster! High-level! Blow them to bits!”
She pointed. The [Fireballs] soared, arcing far, far further than their normal range. They detonated—
And the force of the explosions was blocked. The fiery inferno raged helplessly against the barrier.
The [Aegiscaster] lowered her staff. Behind her, the spells sang again. The [Enchanter], Hedault, conjured a second bolt of lightning. But six struck the [Mage]’s shields.
Is that music I hear? The Drake heard a wail of sound. She didn’t say it though. She was raising her staff.
“Reform the barrier! [Barrier of—]”
Two arrows struck her in the neck and chest. An Antinium and a Hobgoblin lowered their bows. They began loosing arrows as the Hobgoblin behind them played, tears still in his eyes.
Reinforcements.

“I think I just saw Drisshia’s command go down!”
The Luldem commander was pushing into the unwise charge by Liscor’s army. Hectval’s forces were falling back, but they had left their flank open! Now, the heavy-armor regiment from Luldem was carving in.
The [Armor Commander] wasn’t oblivious, however. He saw the flashes of light. He turned—
“Reinforcements! 1st Axes! To the flanks! [Redepl—]”
The words stopped, strangled. The Drakes, turning, cried out. Suddenly—they saw.
A second force had emerged on their side of the battlefield. But not Drakes. Not Humans. Not Gnolls or any other species that belonged on Izril.
Black, beetle-like figures. Some small. Others large. Some had color on their bodies. Others—nothing.
Some had armor. Others, wings, hopping, gliding. But each form was alien.
Insectile.
“Antinium.”
The [Armor Commander] whispered. The Antinium—

Now the Walled Cities watched. Now Ilvriss watched with horror.
“The Black Tide is marching.”
“For this? For this war?”

Somewhere, the Queens were howling at each other. Why now? Xrn was pursuing the Antinium. Ordering them to stop. She had blocked off the tunnel.
“I gave you orders.”
“We disobey.”
Archer B21 spoke. Xrn stared at him. They were what?

“Reinforcements to Hectval at once!”
Az’kerash himself was staring. Not Belavierr, but his Chosen. More and more people, watching this battle no one had heard about.
