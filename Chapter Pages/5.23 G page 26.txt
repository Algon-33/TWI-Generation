Bethal paused. She glanced over her shoulder. The fire was inviting. Her personal tent waiting. Her two [Knights] traded places for sentry duty. Bethal sighed.
“I’m done killing Goblins for a while.”
A pause.
“I see.”
“Don’t ask for my Knights of the Petal either. You may keep them at Invrisil if you need them. But I want sixteen to meet me.”
“Are you taking a role in this conflict with the [Emperor]?”
“I don’t know.”
“Bethal. I need you closer to home. Tyrion is moving.”
“At last.”
“The Goblin Lord is approaching the mountain. He’s slowed. Gathering more Goblins. But when they meet—”
“Yes, yes. And Tyrion will do what, exactly? Why is he delayed?”
“I don’t know.”
“But you can guess.”
More silence from the other end. Bethal sighed into the earring.
“Which side will win, Magnolia? This Goblin tribe or the [Emperor]? The Great Chieftain, Tremborag, or this Goblin Lord? Which do we want to win? And where will Tyrion fit into all this? Will you tell me or leave me guessing?”
“I should hope at least some of those answers would be obvious.”
“Not anymore. I thought I knew good and evil, Magnolia. But all this? This? This is madness.”
Bethal looked around. Distantly, far distant, she thought she could see sparks of light growing against the dark horizon. She wondered if someone was starting a fire. But at that distance—Magnolia’s voice was calm.
“Not madness, Bethal. This is what has always been. Goblins or Humans. It is always the same.”
“What is?”
“War.”
Bethal closed her eyes. She was still for a very long moment as Thomast put his hand on her shoulder. At last she whispered.
“I don’t think it’s the same. Magnolia. I think it hurts differently each time.”
Without waiting for a response she dropped the earring and turned to hug her husband. And in the distance, the fires grew brighter. And brighter. And darker.
