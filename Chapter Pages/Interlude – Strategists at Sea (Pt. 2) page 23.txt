Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)
Page 23
Slowly, the [Strategists] balanced it on the railing. The Bloodtear Pirates yanked it away. They stared at the treasure, forgetting The Emerald Signet for a second. One of the [Pirates] reached for a shimmering blade.
“Stop, idiot! Wait for the net—”
The [Pirate Captain] saw a hand grab the unlucky [Pirate]. Fetohep rose, sighing.
“Sand.”
He didn’t cast a spell. Sand just flooded the [Pirate]’s nose, mouth, eyes, ears—she fell back, choking. The Bloodtear Pirates drew back.
“Neutralize the magic.”
The [Pirate Captain] ordered. Fetohep looked at him. He glanced to the side.
“This is tedious. But amusing in its own way.”
The undead [King] pronounced. He said that, but he was grinning. Always grinning. The [Pirates] turned as The Emerald Signet shot forwards again; the sails were full and restored. The [Pirate Captain] frowned.
“Do we pursue, Captain?”
“…No. Let them go. We’ll deal with the spectre and the two Drowned Ships.”
The [Pirate Captain] came to a quick decision. He looked around. A pair of [Pirates] had a net that cancelled magic and were sneaking up on Fetohep’s left. The [King] pointed a finger.
Magical sand blasted the ambushers. Then, the undead [King] lifted his other hand. A whirlwind blasted the [Pirates] back. It whirled under the casket, pushed it up. And—to the disbelief of the [Pirate Captain], the casket flew through the air.
It landed on The Emerald Signet as the ship stormed ahead. Wil saw Fetohep rise from the casket as the Bloodtear [Pirate Captain] screamed curses and resumed the chase.
“I warned you that once you lost the casket, I would grant you no more chances.”
“Yes, your Majesty. What about a ruse?”
One of Fetohep’s burning flames in his eye sockets flashed.
“I shall consider it amusing. Show me how you continue to struggle, young [Lord].”
The Bloodtear Pirates and Drowned Crews stopped fighting as they realized The Emerald Signet was getting away again. They continued chasing, fighting each other as well as the ship ahead. And now—the [Strategists] were in their element.
“You want one of the swords? Fetch!”
Feshi howled. She heaved over a glittering blade into the sea. One of the Drowned Ships began to dive until Therrium cursed the other [Depth Pirate] out.
“It’s made of glass, you idiot!”
“Glass and string. Nice try, Feshi. My turn.”
Yerra consoled the heartbroken Gnoll. The other [Strategists] were trying another trick. They dumped the barrels of liquor overboard. And as they floated towards the other ship, Feshi loosed an arrow for Yerra.
“[Bursting Arrow]!”
The barrels exploded with fire. The other ships swerved. The [Strategists] were laughing, trying to exchange ideas.
“Peki, fly one of the spare sails in front of the other ships! Blind them!”
“No, we’ll have you attack the rudders! Anyone got a powerful wand?”
They were throwing ideas around left and right. Peki took into the air and began dropping explosive alchemical flasks Feshi had brought, from out of arrow range. But the other ships were coming on, doggedly.
It was a chase. The Emerald Signet had managed to gain a five-minute lead. And it kept to it; it was lighter in the water with less weight. And the Bloodtear Pirates, for all two were smaller ships, were fighting it out with the Drowned Crews.
For all that, it was neck and neck. And—Captain Lasc looked at his stash of emergency wind scrolls.
“Three left.”
“We just need to get in range of the House of Minos! I’ve sent a distress call!”
Venaz shouted. He was staring ahead, trying to see the distant archipelago. But they were still far distant.
