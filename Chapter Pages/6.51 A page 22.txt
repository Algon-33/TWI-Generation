The Necromancer turned. He looked at Bea, and then paused.
“Simply…cooking.”
“Cooking?”
Bea was confused. Az’kerash had never eaten. Not since her creation. But the Necromancer was raising a hand. Absently running his hand through the air. Where would he find…?
“Ingredients. My Chosen.”
“Master?”
They chorused as one. Az’kerash turned his head.
“There is a storeroom filled with foods somewhere in this castle. Preserved. Find it. Bring it to me. Bea, wear gloves.”
“Yes, Master. What do you wish? How many bags of holding?”
The Chosen surged with energy. Az’kerash frowned. He stared through the undead rat’s eyes as Lyonette went for another pizza and slipped.
“One, should do. I will not need much of each…flour. Cheese. Hm. That red sauce. Tomatoes? And some…basil. Eggs. Water. Clean water. Salt? And oil, yes.”
“At once, Master!”
The Chosen raced off, vying to be the first one to return. They ran through the halls, searching room after room. Venitra was the first to find the storehouse. Or so she assumed. She stared at the neat rows of produce, bought by her master for some reason that eluded her. Food. It was so…
“Flour first. Perhaps a bag.”
She eyed the huge bags that would require two grown men to carry. Then she bent and inspected the tubular, round things inside.
“Flour?”
She prodded them. They were soft and had some kind of skin. Was this…Venitra stared at the bag. She circled around it. Then she realized they weren’t labeled.
“Venitra? Is this the room?”
Bea and Kerash skidded into the room. They stared at Venitra. She looked up at them, her competitive spirit fading slightly.
“Bea. Kerash. What does flour look like?”
The two Chosen paused. And then looked at each other. And they realized, among their vast knowledge of the world, cooking had never really been an issue for the undead. They turned into an anxious huddle.
“Flour. That was what master said. I know tomatoes. Red things.”
“Flour. Flowers?”
“No, the white stuff. Like…bone meal?”
“That’s right! What’s salt?”
“Um…the same stuff.”
“No. Eggs?”
“Round.”
“Half the things in here are round!”
“Oh, I know! They turn into chickens!”
Kerash and Venitra stared at Bea. She hesitated.
“I think.”
Az’kerash was still silently watching the meal when his Chosen raced back into the room. He turned his head as they timidly offered him a bag of holding.
“Master, we have brought it. Um…”
The Necromancer reached into the bag and produced the ingredients, one by one. All except for…he stared at a potato.
“This is not an egg, Venitra.”
The bone woman hesitated. Az’kerash inspected the ingredients. He slowly reached for a handful of powder.
“And this is sugar. Not salt. Go back and find the correct ingredients.”
“Yes master.”
The undead hurried off. Az’kerash ignored them. He was fascinated by his own thoughts. How did it go? How did it…flour. And water and eggs. And he needed a bowl—
He looked about for his Chosen and realized they were gone. Absently, Az’kerash clicked his fingers. The stone of the kitchen counter moved, and a perfect, smooth bowl formed out of the stone. The Necromancer stared at it.
“Flour.”
He tossed it in. Egg? He stared at the filthy water that Venitra had brought from somewhere. The undead had a very loose understanding of hygiene too.
“[Purify Water].”
There. Water, clean and sparkling. Az’kerash looked up as his servants raced back in.
“Is this salt?”
“Yes. That’s still not an egg. Venitra. Find me an egg. It looks like—”
Az’kerash clicked his fingers. A floating image of an egg appeared. Venitra gasped.
“That’s an egg? Yes, Master!”
