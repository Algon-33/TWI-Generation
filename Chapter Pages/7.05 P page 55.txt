The Goblins didn’t need to wall-off everything. They were making plans for a defensive structure. A keep, around their camp. That was efficient. But they had grand ideas.
“Walls twice as high as Humans.”
“Why?”
“Makes mad. Funny.”
The Goblins ignored the arguing Humans and the laughing [Emperor]. Leafarmor eyed the distant young man and touched the throwing axe Leafarmor had never used. But Raidpear nudged her. He nodded.
“Build big walls. Like stone city. Big walls. And mine—here. Lots of iron. Trade with Humans.”
Ulvama nodded. Reluctantly. Then she pointed to the iron mine.
“Tunnel here.”
“Through mountain?”
“Into mountain.”
The Goblins had plans. Maybe you could trust Humans. They all doubted it. Even an [Emperor]’s word. But they were stuck here. True, they had all they needed. It might even be a nice place to live. But—just in case. Just in case…
The Goblins built a wall, and Pebblesnatch decided that if they did trade for anything, it would be stuff like milk. Milk was irreplaceable. How did you get milk, anyways? She was unclear on this detail. Maybe you milked the milk-plant.

That night, Pebblesnatch went to sleep and dreamed of the inn. Not in a bad way. Just remembering. The Goblins were chatting about possibility. About the future. They were…different from when they’d come here.
A figure stirred in the cot next to the little Goblin. Ulvama rose. She looked at the little Goblin. Pebblesnatch had been responsible for the change in the Goblins. From start to finish.
It was all her fault. The [Shaman] nearly poked the Cave Goblin. But in the end, she patted Pebblesnatch on the head. She rose, and left the Goblin camp, walking past the base of the walls. Past Goblins who had decided to make something here.
What an odd thought. She looked back. From afar, it almost looked like the beginning of something. A settlement. A…city. With walls. You had to have walls if you were Goblins. It looked unreal. Like someone else’s dream.
She shook her head. The [Shaman] went on. Walking into a forest. She knew the path well. She could be stealthy.
The little tree with the hiding space was empty of all the Cave Goblin’s possessions save one. A glowing, red stone glinted in the trunk. And a crude door of bark sat against the tree. Ulvama studied the stone. She picked it up, put it in the door. It seemed to fit the hole hollowed for it.
The [Shaman] swung the door open. She waited. And her eyes narrowed. But nothing happened. Slowly, she bent and inspected the glowing, red stone.
“Too far.”
Ulvama poked the stone. Her head turned. She stared south. At something in the distance. She grunted.
“Very far. Too weak.”

And in an inn, Erin Solstice paced by the magic door. A yawning Lyonette cuddled Mrsha.
“Erin, stop that. What are you doing?”
“I keep telling you! I got this feeling when I was on holiday—and its back! There’s something up with this door. It’s like—I have this instinct.”
Erin was restlessly opening the door as she changed the dial to each stone on it. The door to Celum opened, then Liscor. A [Guard] in Pallass jumped as he stared at the door through a metal gate. Erin waved.
“Hi. I’m Erin.”
She closed the door and turned to Lyonette. Then—absently, she turned the dial to an unused setting.
A red stone flashed on the door. Erin stared at it. Slowly, she opened the door.
Nothing happened. Lyonette frowned sleepily at the red stone.
“What one was that for, Erin? The Bloodfields?”
