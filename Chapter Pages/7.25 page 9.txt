The Runner’s Guild was still intact. Incredibly. But it had been ransacked. The Bloodfeast Raiders had just walked in and taken all the packages, ripped open everything for delivery and taken what they liked. Then strolled out, as casual as you please.
It was the only reason it was still standing. Now, people were resting inside, many homeless. The staff was trying to help. But the woman at the desk was busy writing letters.
“Attacked. Bloodfeast Raiders…send [Healers], builders. Anyone that can be spared.”
The [Receptionist] stopped writing. She stamped it with a seal, shakily handed it to a dazed Street Runner.
“Take it to every village you can. [Headsman]—[Village Elder]—I don’t care. Tell them we need help. Start at Cimin—keep running. Go.”
She pushed at the Street Runner. The girl stumbled out of the guild. The [Receptionist] looked up. Her eyes widened.
“Fals? And is that—Ryoka Griffin?”
The young woman raised her head. She knew the [Receptionist]. But she had never learned her name.
“Ryoka has something to say. Ryoka—I have to keep looking around. Take care of her, will you? She’s injured.”
Fals let Ryoka lean on the counter and backed away. He ran, as the [Receptionist] nodded to him.
“Miss Ryoka. You need to lie down. We don’t have any beds, but—”
“I take full responsibility.”
Ryoka tried to raise her head. The [Receptionist] blinked at her. She looked at Ryoka.
“For what? Them?”
“Yes. I had an—a valuable—they took it. That’s why they came here. If I wasn’t here, they wouldn’t have come.”
Ryoka felt at her side. Then realized—her iPhone was gone. They’d taken it. She felt it’s loss. But she looked at the [Receptionist]. Slowly, Ryoka put her hands flat on the counter.
“It’s my fault.”
The woman looked at Ryoka. Exasperated at first. Then—sympathetically, as she saw how unfocused Ryoka’s eyes were. She spoke slowly.
“Miss Ryoka. No one is blaming you. Those were the Bloodfeast Raiders. They attack everyone. It was just chance they came here.”
The room flinched at the name. Ryoka blinked a few times.
“But—”
“It is not your fault. Put your hands away, please. If you can move—lie down or help. But you did nothing wrong. Even if we wanted to arrest you—we couldn’t. The jails will be full of homeless people. Half the city is gone. We—may have to abandon Celum. The undead will rise within a day.”
The [Receptionist] was not unsympathetic. She just had no time for Ryoka. Slowly, the city Runner realized—she was being a fool. She put her hands down, had to lean on the counter.
“Sorry.”
“You’re in shock. Take a potion. The one at your belt.”
“This one?”
Ryoka’s head was swimming. The [Receptionist] helped her uncork the potion, swallow half of the stamina draught. Some of the blood loss began to fade from Ryoka’s head.
“Sorry.”
“If you are, I’ll take this. We need it. Can you spare anything? Potions? There are so many burned—and we need to count names. The Raiders—took some of our people.”
Ryoka saw there was a list being made on the counter. She fumbled for her potions.
“Here. Take it.”
The woman took the potions, called out. One of the Street Runners trotted over. She eyed Ryoka; the City Runner was holding onto the counter.
“You warned us. But for that it might have been worse, Miss Ryoka. More than a few families lived by hiding in the basements. More fled the city ahead of the Raiders. You should lie down now.”
“I…I…saw them. I need to make a report. I can tell you about them. Those bastards. They were talking in front of me. Blew up a carriage. But I saw them.”
The [Receptionist] froze. She reached for a quill slowly.
“…Yes?”
