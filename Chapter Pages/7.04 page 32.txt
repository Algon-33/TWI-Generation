Lyonette stomped on Erin’s foot. The [Innkeeper] hopped around.
“This isn’t fair! I just wanted to come back to my nice, peaceful inn! Why do I have to…”
“Delivery for Miss Erin Solstice!”
The young woman turned. Fals stood behind Erin, a package in his hands. The City Runner looked slightly put-upon. But this is how it had started. With a package. The City Runner had been delayed by drama, Wyverns, and an absent [Innkeeper]. But nothing—not even Palt jockeying for position—was going to stop him.
“What’s this?”
“A delivery for you, Miss Erin. It came by City Runner, and I’ve been waiting to get it to you. I just need a seal, so I can confirm I got it to you. It’s slightly heavy.”
“Oh. Well—do I have a seal?”
“Here.”
Lyonette passed Erin one. She handed it to Fals. He grinned, relieved.
“Thank you. I just have to give it to you so I can swear it was delivered to you by truth spell!”
He handed the package to Erin. She took it.
“It is heavy! And square!”
She stared at the wrapped package. Something…flickered in her memory. Not like fire, but this was a familiar scene. She stared at Fals.
“Did you…who is it from?”
“Don’t know. But it came here through me, from the north. No idea who it is, but I’m fairly certain no one’s unwrapped it. They do that sometimes. Thanks. I’m going to head back to Celum. I’d love to chat, but you have a line. Can I drop by tomorrow?”
“Oh, sure—”
Erin saw there was indeed a line of people. Wanting to speak to her, to catch up, and so on. Fals grinned at Erin.
“It’s good to see you back, Miss Solstice.”
“Hey.”
Erin reached out and grabbed Fals’ arm. She smiled at him.
“You too. Don’t be a stranger!”
“And tell the Players that the inn’s open, please!”
Lyonette followed Fals out the doors and into the hallway. Erin turned to the package. Palt was eying it too, curiously. He glanced up at Erin.
“Anyone you know?”
“Maybe…”
Erin blinked at the package. It was heavy. And—she looked at it and remembered something similar. It was even wrapped the same way. Speculatively, Erin looked around the inn. Mrsha got up on two legs to sniff at the package, but she clearly detected nothing from the inside.
“Hey Lyonette. Where’s my chess board?”
“In your room. Mrsha kept swatting the pieces off it.”
“Oh, you—”
Erin saw Mrsha roll under a table. She turned.
“I’m just going to open this in my room. Be right back!”
“Aw! I want to see!”
Relc complained. He jostled Beza out of the way—the Minotauress tried to shove him back, but she missed. Olesm entered the inn.
“Is Erin here? Oh, Erin—I’m so glad you’re back. I wanted to say—”
“Back of the line!”
Selys, Beza, and six other pairs of hands dragged Olesm back. Relc was shoving with Palt. Erin laughed.
“Keep back! All of you! I’m going up to my room for one second! I’ll deal with you one by one!”
She headed for the stairs. Relc shouted at Erin’s back.
“If it explodes, just scream!”
Erin laughed, but she eyed the package a second time. She felt…well, she headed up the stairs.
Her room was new. Lyonette had made the bed, but Erin had already turned it a bit messy. Erin’s room…didn’t have much. Her clothes had been folded and put into a dresser—what ones Lyonette had salvaged from the inn. She had a few other possessions in the room as well.
Her belt pouches. A knife that had been sent through the magic door this morning by Lorent of all people. The [Sharpener] had identified the blade. A toothbrush in its stand. A few books Selys had gifted Erin. Oh, and…
