Typhenous paused in his drink. He was unsteady on his feet, but he had seen the [Bartender] move. And old you might be, but stupid or unobservant people didn’t get old.
“I saw it. You think it’s a face?”
“Can’t be. Grev tells me the Players are beloved in Invrisil by gangs. It would be unwise. An outsider, maybe.”
“Should we check?”
“Mm. Let’s. Halrac.”
The [Scout] looked up. Typhenous pointed.
“There’s a situation.”
The man’s good mood vanished again. Halrac growled.
“If this is another cause of—”
“Don’t be stupid. This is me seeing something. Get the team ready. Someone’s going after Lacel the Leaper.”
The leader of Griffon Hunt stiffened. He grabbed Briganda and Revi. They followed Typhenous and Eltistiman up the stairs, silently.
“Stay behind us. If it’s one of the street, she’ll be fast and good at close-quarters fighting. Maybe a poison expert. What do you think? Ward spells and immobilization?”
Typhenous cautioned the others, none of whom were good at extremely close-quarters fights. Eltistiman nodded.
“There are two of us—plus your team. Let’s go in first. Talk—then cast. Ward spells on us.”
“Thanks for the confidence. Who is it?”
“We don’t know. Someone pursuing the bounty. Now—[Muffle]. And…”
Lacel’s room wasn’t hard to find. The two [Mages] moved in front, and approached the door. Halrac pointed at himself and Briganda, but Typhenous shook his head. He motioned to Eltistiman. The younger man nodded, pushed the door open.
“Stop.”
The [Assassin] was waiting for them. She aimed a crossbow at them as the two [Mages] aimed at her with staff and wand. She stood by the open window; they’d caught her just as she was leaving.
Lacel the Leaper lay in the bed. His eyes were bulging but he made no sound behind the cloth wrapped around his face. He was secured to the bed. And a blanket was covering his legs…
It was stained with red. Revi stared. She aimed her wand at the woman.
“Who are you!?”
“Don’t move!”
Halrac aimed his bow at her chest. The woman made a tsking sound. She had a mask on her face, concealing her identity.
“I don’t know if you’re a face, but this is the Player of Celum’s inn. This was unwise. Drop it. And if you go through the window—we’ll catch you.”
Eltistiman’s eyes flashed. His wand was glowing, aimed at her. The woman paused.
“I’m no face. And if I were you, I’d pretend you didn’t see me. Well done on spotting me.”
“And we should just let you go?”
“His legs!”
Revi stared at Lacel in horror. Briganda’s hatchet was raised. She looked at Typhenous and Eltistiman. The woman sighed behind her mask.
“I’m sure you could stop me. But—look. This is whom I represent. We’re not abiding by Reinhart’s laws.”
She traced a sigil in the air. It glowed darkly, with black light. Revi didn’t recognize it. But Typhenous and Eltistiman did. They inhaled sharply. And both instantly lowered their weapons.
“The Guild. Halrac, don’t shoot her. You too, Revi.”
Typhenous murmured. The female [Assassin] nodded.
“This is a public statement. No hard feelings. I love the plays. I’d ask for an autograph, but something tells me I’m not welcome. If that’s all—”
She leapt out the window. Halrac swore, but Eltistiman and Typhenous blocked him. The [Scout] rushed to the window, but the woman was gone.
“Typhenous!”
“Hm. Legs are well and truly broken. This is definitely a message. He’s even got his bag of holding, see? Still locked.”
The Plague Mage wearily walked over to inspect Lacel. The Courier was shaking in his bindings. Eltistiman rubbed at his face.
