Pisces looked up. The half-Elf wavered. She fell silent. Yvlon looked at Ksmvr. He’d opened his mandibles. She slowly nudged him and he closed them and looked at her. The whirling silence grew deeper around the Horns of Hammerad.

Across the inn, Erin twisted her hands in her cooking apron. Lyonette was feeding Mrsha dinner at the bar. The Gnoll cub whined in the back of her throat, but Lyonette was soothing her.
“Not yet, Mrsha dear. They’re busy. Everyone’s a bit—just eat your dinner. You can go cheer up Moore, okay?”
She looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] hadn’t taken her eyes off the Horns. She longed to go over, to smile—but it wouldn’t have been genuine. Erin wanted to do something. But she knew that she might make things worse. What could she do?
It was like a puzzle, one of the ones where you had a specific shape that could fit in a whole. That was how Erin would have described it. She muttered as she saw Pisces snap something at Ceria.
“Food? No. Cake? Spaghetti? No. Alcohol?”
She paused and eyed the Horns.
“No. Mrsha? No. Faerie flower drink? No.”
“Erin?”
Lyonette looked at her. Erin turned her head, blinking. Mrsha looked up quizzically. Erin silently shook her head.
“It’s nothing.”
She turned her head back to the Horns. She saw Pisces’ face. But nothing fit. So she just watched.

Ceria was hesitating, biting her lip. Ksmvr had cleared away the posters, but it hung over them. She could see Gnolls and Drakes glancing at Pisces. And his name hung in her head.
Pisces Jealnet. She had never known his name. And she’d been in the academy with him! All this time—she hesitated, clearing her throat.
“Pisces, if you want to talk about it—”
Pisces’ head jerked up. His cheeks were still flushed. He clenched his hands in his robes.
“Talk? About what, pray tell?”
His tone was beyond acerbic. Ceria could feel the hurt in every line of it. She hesitated.
“Look, the bounty’s wrong. We know the academy’s lying. Erin knows it. We all know it. But if you want to talk—about Montressa? About…”
His eyes narrowed dangerously.
“About my name? Or the spurious allegations? Are you wondering if any of them are accurate?”
“No! Not at all! It’s just—”
Ceria raised her hands defensively. Pisces stared at her.
“Just what?”
“Look—I know some of it’s not true, but I know you committed some crimes. And we never knew your name. Montressa appearing out of nowhere was a shock. But she—you know she has a reason to—”
“To beat me into unconsciousness? To cast a spell on Selys and kidnap you all?”
The half-Elf wavered. But she had to say it.
“Yes.”
He stared at her. Yvlon opened her mouth and Ceria rushed on.
“Not to attack us! But she was there, Pisces. You know what she must have thought. We never got to speak with her. Look, I’m saying she’s wrong. But she had a reason to hate you. I’m absolutely against her. You heard me shouting! But let’s talk about it, okay?”
“What is there to discuss? She is after me. If you would avoid Wistram’s ire—”
“We’re not abandoning you, Pisces. You’re a teammate.”
Yvlon spoke quietly. Pisces looked at her. He half-rose.
“And so I should confess all my sins, is that it?”
“No! Pisces! Just tell us—we just want to know the truth.”
“You can read it. I don’t owe you explanations!”
The [Necromancer] was furious. He got up. Ceria rose with him.
“Pisces, just talk to us—”
“Comrade Pisces, it would be best to share information at this time. The communication of information with your peers will help us better aid you. Captain Ceria is only inquiring about your wellbeing.”
