Cold. Colder. So cold that even Frost Faeries would scream at the chill. Colder than Illphres’ ice. Ceria was reaching deep in herself, pulling magic from her very bones. Pisces stared as she lifted her wand.
Walls of ice rose from the ground, shielding them. They thickened, creating a shield of frozen water. They would not break.
“Ceria—”
She was making a shield on her hill. Ceria looked up and grinned at Pisces. She pointed.
“Go on. Get out of here. You can make it.”
Pisces stared at Ceria. He was the only one who could hear her in the shattered howling battle, the sounds of dying. Pisces—and Az’kerash.
“What? But—”
She pointed into the distance behind them. Towards the Bloodfields. The Crelers had fought to the death there. Some remained, but if you could outrun them, even the adult might stop. Everything would attack it there.
“Get lost, Pisces. I’ll cover your back.”
The ice was growing thicker. The air was turning to vapor. The Creler recoiled from the chill. Aiming at her. At Pisces. The first volley struck the walls. And the ice held.
Pisces looked at her. Uncomprehending. Ceria smiled. She waved one hand.
“I won’t be mad. One of us has to do it and I’m too slow. Besides, I already had my turn. So did Yvlon. If Ksmvr comes back—maybe they’ll let him. Go. One of us needs to live.”
Far away, the Necromancer stared, listening to unfamiliar words.
“Master?”
His hand moved and his mouth opened. But then he sat back.
“No. No. It will make you strong, boy. We must be alone. Even she will—let her die like this.”
He covered his eyes and wept. But he had forgotten how to cry.
Next to Ceria, Pisces looked at her face. She turned back to the adult. It was charging her walls of ice, ramming into them. She snarled at him.
“Go on, you idiot. Do the smart thing!”
“I—”
Ceria saw a flicker as the adult Creler opened its maw. She shoved him away. The ice shattered around her. But still, it held. And it grew again, reforming. The half-Elf taunted the monster in front of her.
“Come on, come on! Try it!”
Her body was turning to ice. But she didn’t care. Ceria’s heart stopped. Her blood froze in her veins as she drew more and more. Liquid ran from her eyes and froze. She pointed at the adult Creler and it stopped. A third time, it opened its mouth and Ceria waited. She laughed as she raised her wand, focusing the cold into one last—
Something hurtled at her from the side. It knocked her off her feet. The spell vanished from Ceria’s mind. She turned, gasping, and saw Pisces. He stared at her and the ice exploded around them.
Both hit the ground. Ceria stared up at Pisces as he scrambled to his feet.
“I told you to run!”
The [Necromancer] nodded. Then he paused.
“I tried. But—how strange. It seems I’d rather die than leave my friends behind.”
He grinned at her, a wide, wild smile. Ceria stared at him. She blinked the frozen tears out of her eyes.
“You idiot!”
“Yes. I am. I’m sorry.”
Pisces held out a hand. Ceria took it. Above them, the Creler was hunting for them. Killing. Laughing.
But Ceria Springwalker was still smiling. Somehow. Maybe it was because Pisces was standing with her. He gripped her hand tightly and she didn’t let go. They held hands as they stood and faced their end.
“If only it was stronger.”
Pisces murmured ruefully as he lifted his rapier. Ceria nodded. She was so close to him. As close as they had once been. They looked at each other, friends. And Ceria felt something flicker in her heart. Her right hand held her wand. Her hand of bone held Pisces’ hand.
