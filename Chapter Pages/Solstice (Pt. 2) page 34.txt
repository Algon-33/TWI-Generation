Solstice (Pt. 2)
Page 34
The sun had waned since this strangeness had come over the air.
It was all because of the figure.
He sat on the prow of the scull. It should have overturned the lightweight craft. But he weighed nothing. The still waters moved; ripples from his feet.
Luan was afraid. His oars rested, half in the water. His palms were sweaty.
He had forgotten what day it was. But he had not forgotten the last time.
The Winter Solstice. Only this time—things were different. It had not been this stillness last time. He had paddled through fog. Through…to meet someone who begged for…
“You’re not her.”
That was all he said at last. He had sat there, perhaps for hours, refusing to speak. To even meet…his eyes.
The man who sat there was an idea, to Luan, the longer he looked. More than just features; he was the very embodiment of…passion. Passion, and love, and meetings.
To look at his smile was to want to talk to him forever. To stare into his eyes was to remember love lost and gained.
Luan wanted to like him. But his fear was a physical thing. He wanted to abandon his boat, to dance upon the waters. And he did not know why he wanted to do such things.
He remembered his family. And the stranger smiled.
“No. I am not. Will you speak to me now, Luan?”
“How do you know my name?”
Luan thought about raising the oars to strike the figure. But he did not. Could not. The dancing man smiled. Luan watched the ripples in the water. His skin pricked and goose bumps rose.
“I know many things. I know you fear me. You need not, you know. Would you not take a drowning woman’s hand? For shame.”
The [Rower] bristled.
“I nearly did. I offered her my oar. But she wanted my hand. And the more I looked—the warier I became. She was an old woman at first. Then a young one. Then in her middle years. She didn’t climb onto my boat. She didn’t take the oar. She wanted my hand.”
“And you did not offer it to her. Wise, perhaps. But won’t you take mine?”
The figure reached out. Luan leaned back, nearly overbalancing the scull. He righted himself; the figure did not lean over. Nor did he touch Luan, although they were close enough.
The man feared to fall into the waters. Just as much as he feared to touch the hand.
Something was down there.
“Oh yes. And they are desperate. More than I. If you were to choose between the two—choose me.”
“I would rather you go into the waters and leave me alone. What are you?”
The figure did not respond. He looked at Luan, disappointed.
“I thought you would like me more than she. I tried to find you last time, you know. But we three went to the first instead and had nothing to offer her. You though—you are surely mine, aren’t you?”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m not anyone’s.”
Luan countered. He licked his lips, staring into the water. Was it…whispering to him? Something down there wanted him to dive into it.
Touch me.
“Yes, you are. You love your family.”
Luan’s head rose. His eyes blazed. His golden tattoo—he stared at it, and then at the figure.
“Don’t talk of them.”
“Why not? I know love. I know family. The love of a sister, a wife, a child—this is my domain. This is what I am. Love, friendship, passion. The arts are half mine, half his. I believe in art. You—won’t you even consider it?”
The truth ran in all of his words. Luan felt it. This man was joy in life. Experience; like when Luan had first felt that burning rush of adrenaline. The thrill of dancing with his wife.
All those things at once were in the hand he offered. And still. Luan refused to take it.
“She said the exact same things. Only—she was like looking at—”
