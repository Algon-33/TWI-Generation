“It’s the newest thing. Alchemist Quelm’s latest invention—matches! They came out in the city earlier, but Mister Quelm—excuse me, Alchemist Quelm—was working on them ahead of everyone else and his designs were stolen. These are the best in the city, the only ones sold in the city these days, in fact! No one’ll buy the inferior designs, so we have all of them!”
“I’m sure.”
The [Nightstalker] smirked. Even sardonic, her smile could turn a man’s head. The [Enforcer] was unaffected; he’d met women with her type of Skills before, but the [Shop Assistant] had clearly never run into a woman like the Sister of Chell. He hesitated, and his eyes fixed on her still beautiful face, and then cleavage for a moment. She glared at him and he turned red. The [Enforcer]’s cough brought the young man back to his senses.
“I—uh, well, these are the matches! And they’re wonderful. Ever seen what they do?”
“That’s why we’re here.”
“Well…observe! You don’t need magic or tinder or anything else! You just strike the match against this box here, or even a rough surface and—fire!”
The [Enforcer] blinked as the match head flared into flame. The Sister of Chell recoiled and the [Blackguard] twitched. The [Assistant] noticed none of this as he held up the match, admiring the flame.
“You see? As simple as that! It’s all alchemy, no—”
“No magic.”
The Sister spoke flatly. The [Enforcer] reached into his jacket pocket and felt at a little orb he kept there.
“No magic. Mind if I try one, sir? Or need I buy this box?”
“Oh, no! You can try one for free. And a box’ll only be six silvers! For twenty matches? Very cheap!”
“Expensive is what it is! I used to be able to pay two silver for a box of twenty four, and then four for the same amount at Stitchworks! Why’s the price gone up?”
Another shopper complained as she browsed the shelves of boxes. Some were painted different colors and varying sizes of matches were on display. The [Shop Assistant] cleared his throat self-importantly.
“It’s about quality, Miss.”
“Expensive is what it is! I like these things, but they’re not better than a flint at these prices!”
“But it’s convenient, Miss—”
The [Enforcer] listened with half an ear to the discussion. He lit the match on the box the way he’d seen the young man do it. He lifted the match and watched the flame burn. The [Enforcer] wore gloves as a habit so he didn’t bother tossing the match as it burned down. He noted how hot the flame was and handed the box to the Sister before nodding in approval.
“This is very nice. Very posh. Beats magic for me and I love the feeling of it. I could see some of my associates being very interested. This will be a bit of gold—if another [Alchemist] doesn’t figure it out.”
The [Nightstalker] lit one match, dropped it before it could burn her, and then another. She ignored the [Shop Assistant]’s protests and eyed the second before tossing it on the floor. The young man hurriedly stomped it out. The [Nightstalker] flicked the box back at him and nodded.
“Not going to happen in Celum. But I like it too. No magic, just a stick. Easy to start fires with secretly. Give me five.”
“And me ten I suppose.”
The delighted young [Shop Assistant] brightened as the pair bought fifteen boxes all together. The other shoppers gaped at the gold being forked over so casually; the [Enforcer] and [Nightstalker] didn’t blink. Nor did the money in the store’s till vanish after it was handed over. Neither of them were [Thieves].
After that, the trio walked outside the shop and thought. The Sister lit a match, watched it burn with a smile, and nodded.
