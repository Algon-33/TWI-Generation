The Goblins turned to look at Garen. The Hob went still. His eyes burned as he slowly looked up at Reiss and shook his head.
“They were not my tribe. They never believed I was one of them.”
Reiss’ eyes narrowed as he gulped more water.
“But they were yours. They trusted you. And you killed them. For the key. Do your Redfangs know that? Garen killed his own?”
His Redfangs did. At least, Redscar did. But even his gaze was uncertain. They must have heard the tale from Garen. But Reiss had thrown that into doubt. Garen shifted.
“I did everything for Goblins. For Goblins.”
“So did I!”
Reiss nearly stood again, but Eater of Spears patted his shoulder. The Goblin Lord visibly calmed himself and kept drinking from his cup. Garen copied him by eating from his bowl of meat. The two of them glared at each other, looking so alike in that moment that Rags could see them sitting together, just like they had in the smoke.
At last, Reiss sighed. He tore his gaze away from Garen and looked at Rags.
“So, little Chieftain. That is our story. That is our past. That is why Garen calls me slave and I do not. I have a master. I will not pretend he thinks of Goblins as anything but tools. But he will give us power if we fulfill his wishes. What other option is there?”
“Freedom.”
Garen spoke quietly. Tremborag crunched a bone.
“Pride.”
“So you say.”
Reiss looked back at the other two Chieftains. His gaze fixed on Tremborag.
“You sat in your mountain, ‘Great Chieftain’. The Goblin King called and you did not answer. You grew your tribe and it was mighty, yes. But for what? Are you content to hide from Humans forever? Why have you done nothing?”
Tremborag tossed aside the cow’s femur.
“You want to know my past? You want to know why I refused Velan? How I became Great Chieftain? The secret of my strength?”
He flexed one arm and muscle grew out of fat. Reiss nodded. The other Goblins leaned forwards. Tremborag gazed around.
“No. That story is mine. I am Tremborag of the Mountain and I will reclaim my home. I bow to no Goblin Lord. You traitors I will hunt down. That is the only story you need know.”
He pointed at Poisonbite, who jumped. Reiss shook his head. He looked towards Rags.
“So. The Great Chieftain refuses. Garen refuses. But do you see, Rags?”
“Yes.”
Rags did see. She saw pride in Tremborag, and that burning fury and loss in Garen as well as Reiss. The two were separate, but they had been—she hesitated. Rags looked from Garen to Reiss. Her eyes narrowed.
“One question. You two have sex? Lovers?”
Reiss choked on his water. Garen paused as he chewed on his meat. Both Hobgoblins stared at Rags. Then Garen dumped his bowl of meat onto the ground and spat out what he was eating. Reiss shook his head.
“No. We were never—no.”
“Oh.”
Rags shrugged. The Goblin Lord’s face was a mix of chagrin and amusement as he wiped his mouth. Redscar looked amused as well. Garen did not.
“Fah. That was your question?”
Tremborag eyed Rags as he found another wine flask. Rags shrugged.
“Important question.”
Pyrite nodded.
“Good to know.”
Tremborag snorted and glanced dismissively at Pyrite. His gaze found Pyrite’s face and then paused. The Great Chieftain frowned and put down his wine.
“Wait. I recognize the other traitors behind you. But you. Do I…know you?”
He stared hard at Pyrite. The Hob glanced up. He was breaking up bone and sucking the marrow out. He shrugged.
“No.”
Tremborag wasn’t convinced. He stared at Pyrite.
“I…do. You were of my tribe once, weren’t you?”
“Maybe.”
