The wires snapped together, wrapping around the carriage before falling to the ground. Magnolia was wrapped by them for one moment—but Teriarch’s ring saved her. It was fit for an [Empress]; meant to be worn into battle against leveled opponents higher than those known to the world today.
It was still running out of mana. But it saved her again. She fell to the ground as the wires sagged, the field the [Assassin] had set up sacrificed for the Skill.
Then…she saw the blood.
Her two maids, Imina and Fini—were dead. They had been cut to—Magnolia’s stomach lurched.
Ressa was alive. She staggered upright. Magnolia’s head moved around, searching.
“Sacra? Reynold?”
“I’m here.”
Reynold answered her slowly. He was halfway inside the carriage. He had been shoved inside. That had saved him. She had been too slow, though.
Sacra lay halfway across the inside, on his lap. Reynold looked down at her. He looked at her blank eyes. The [Butler] rose, slowly.
“Reynold? Reynold, they’re coming. Protect Magnolia.”
Ressa spoke to him over the static in his ears. The [Combat Butler] looked up. Ressa’s face was pale.
“Try to—protect her. Help has to be coming. Someone…”
She whirled. The bolt of lightning illuminated the world. When the blindness and ringing were gone—Reynold saw Ressa.
The [Mage], the throwing expert, and the [Martial Artist] all surrounded her. They were attacking in tandem, dodging her dagger and wearing her down.
That left the trap expert and blade master. The [Trapmaster] was speaking calmly.
“Hold the [Lady] down and stab her to death. Pull her ring off if you have to. I’ll stop her from running.”
“Give me a minute.”
The [Blademaster] walked at the Butler. His blade shone, part glass, part metal. Some work of art, with the reach of a greatsword, but only one edge.
“[Butler]. Leave. You’re not our target.”
The man with the sword addressed Reynold curtly. He pointed with his blade, indicating the open road. Reynold saw Magnolia backing up as the [Trapmaster] ducked out of the way of the wand she held.
“Leave?”
Reynold looked at the [Assassin] with the sword. The man nodded.
“You don’t have to die here. This is your one chance. What will it be?”
He waited, a mockery of honor as he held his sword at the ready. Reynold looked down at Sacra. Gently, he lowered her to the ground. The [Butler] drew his sword. He wiped at his eyes so he could see.
“Run? Never. To the death, you worthless bastards.”
He advanced, his sword held between both hands. The [Blademaster] sighed. Reynold heard Magnolia make a sound of pain. Ressa was faltering as the [Martial Artist] kicked her into another bolt of lightning.
Reynold charged.
“[Double Slash]! [Evasive St—]”
The [Assassin] whirled. His sword lashed out.
Reynold fell down. He tried to get back up. But something was wrong. He looked back and saw the problem.
His legs were gone. Severed. The [Butler] stared. Then he tried to crawl forwards. He slashed at the [Assassin]’s legs with a wordless cry.
The man walked past him. Magnolia was pinned. The [Trapmaster], exasperated, fired a crossbow point-blank into her neck.
“Who gave you that ring?”
She didn’t answer him. She looked up. The [Trapmaster] nodded to the [Blademaster].
“End this.”
The other man lifted his sword overhead. He looked up, for the invisible watchers. His eyes flickered down to Magnolia.
Lord Tyrion Veltras ran him through the stomach. The [Lord] turned; the [Trapmaster]’s eyes widened.
“To me!”
The [Lord] bellowed. The watchers stared.

Then.
“Lady Magnolia Reinhart?”
