“Wiskeria, I—I’ve misjudged you. You and your group have given—no. Wiskeria, listen to me.”
She looks at me.
“Be my [General].”
I say it softly. She blinks as if she can’t understand. But she’s smart.
“What? How?”
I turn. So many wounded. So many hurt. A battle with no [Strategist] or [Leader]. I look back at her.
“I have…a certain number of positions I can give away as an [Emperor]. Not many positions of nobility; they’re filled. But every ruler needs someone to direct their armies. I’d like that person to be you.”
“Me?”
“You lead the battle. You’ve lead a group. No one else can do it. Beniar is too reckless, but you—you could do it.”
“But I’m a [Witch]. I never dreamed of being a [General]. I can’t just give up my class.”
“Be a [Witch], then. Be a [General], too. Be the first [Witch General] the world has ever seen. If that class exists, you’ll have it. If not—I’ll make it for you. But be mine, Wiskeria.”
I hold out my hand to her, in the barn full of grieving voices and death. There isn’t anything else in the world but Wiskeria and me. She stares at my hand, at me.
“Take my hand and walk with me until the world ends or we do.”
Forever passes as we look at each other. There’s still so much we don’t know. But she knows enough of me and I know her. She takes my hand. And it’s done.
I find Durene after the rest of it. She’s crying, holding a friend. I hold her close and feel her shaking. We lie down for a second and hold each other. For a second of rest. Then she gets up to help the wounded again. My [Paladin]. I close my eyes.
 
[Emperor Level 15!]
[Skill – Empire: Art of the Builder Obtained!]
 
[Skill – Undying Loyalty Learned.]
 
Sleep calls. But I hear the voice and know. In my heart. It pulls me up. I stand.
[Undying Loyalty]. A word for what I did. A chance. Just one.
So I sit with Gamel throughout the night. He alone lives. The rest, those who I called back from the grave—
Die.
 
Day 70
 
Durene leveled too. That’s the upshot of it. Wiskeria became a Level 4 [General] overnight—Prost leveled. I don’t think there was one person in the village who didn’t level or gain a class, come to that.
There’s no work to be done the next day. Just burying the dead and burning the Goblins. I feel like a ghost at times, so little do I speak. There’s no need for an [Emperor] to order anything at this moment. I just need to be there so people can see me. To know I’m there.
They still believe in me. They believe in a man who ordered them to fight and die. Because in doing so, I saved them. I cannot forgive myself, but there is nothing to forgive for them.
We are alive. I go on with that knowledge keeping me sane.
Durene and I sit together after the digging is done. The cold ground is rough, but she is tireless. Among her new Skills is [Lesser Endurance].
Now, in the quiet of mourning I finally tell her the truth. She sits cross-legged with me, feeding Frostwing and letting the bird nip her fingers. Frostwing flaps her wings and a feather floats down.
“A [General], a [Steward], a [Paladin]…all of these classes are rare. Special. Stronger than normal classes because they’re more important, you could say. Or so my theory goes.”
“So that’s why you gave it to me.”
“Well, that wasn’t my idea to begin with. That was…luck.”
“Oh. But it’s better than other classes?”
“Better than [Warrior]? Yes, I think so. I think some classes are just designed that way, in whatever system this world works off of.”
“But that’s not fair.”
