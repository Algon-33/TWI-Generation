The Worker slowed as Lyonette walked across the floor with him. He copied her flawlessly, absently. It was as if the dance came to him as naturally as breathing. Of course, it was just following orders. It was effortless for him and Lyonette found herself moving into more advanced positions absently.
“I do not understand love. Is it like liking?”
“Yes. Sort of.”
“And I love you?”
“I don’t know.”
“Is it inconvenient for you? I would hate for that to be so.”
“No. It’s not. It’s…flattering, really. Mostly. Sometimes it can be awful if someone likes you and you don’t like them back. But not always. And I—I think I like you too, Pawn. Maybe.”
“I see.”
The Worker just stared at Lyonette. She turned beet red.
“Well?”
“That makes me happy. Am I supposed to have another reaction?”
“No! Yes! Aren’t you embarrassed?”
Abruptly, Lyonette stopped the waltz. Pawn stopped too. He let go of her hands and took a step back.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know. This is all so surprising. I only know that I like dancing with you.”
“No, don’t be—”
Lyonette was embarrassed again. She looked at Pawn.
“Pawn, this is a mess. I thought you were obsessed with my class. With helping me.”
“I am.”
“But you like me, don’t you see?”
“That is why I want to help you.”
“But does it mean you want my [Princess] class back?”
“Of course! It defines you. It is who you are.”
“But can’t I be someone without it? That’s what I want.”
Lyonette spread her hands out helplessly. Pawn waited, trying to comprehend and she spoke.
“For so long I’ve been defined only by my class! Only by being a princess! Now I have a job. I’m leveling in other classes! I think part of me, a large part, wanted to lose my class. So I could be someone else.”
“But why do you have to be? Why can you not be a [Princess] and everything else?”
“I—it’s because it’s so huge. And I don’t want it. All the things I could never live up to, all the duties I’m abandoning by being here—it’s too much. Do you understand?”
“No. Is the dance over?”
Pawn looked at Lyonette. She threw up her hands.
“I don’t know!”
In the silence Pawn shuffled his feet.
“I enjoyed dancing with you.”
“So did I. We could try again.”
Lyonette reached for Pawn’s hands, but both Antinium and Human turned as they realized they had company. A Soldier stood next to the two. Lyonette stared up at Yellow Splatters. He wasn’t the only one. Every Soldier and Worker in the barracks had abandoned their posts along the walls. They were nearly lined up in front of Lyonette and Pawn.
“Pawn? What do they want?”
“Oh.”
Pawn sounded disappointed. He looked at Yellow Splatters and turned to Lyonette apologetically.
“I am sorry, Lyonette. They want to dance too.”
“With me?”
“No. With me.”
Lyonette gaped. But the Antinium were looking at Pawn. He hesitated and glanced at Lyonette.
“I—”
Someone brushed past him. Pawn and Lyonette saw Purple Smile interpose himself in between Yellow Splatters and the two. He raised two hands and blocked the [Sergeant]. He held up his other two hands and gave Pawn a thumbs up. The Worker nodded gratefully as the other Antinium were shepherded by Purple Smile into their own pairs.
“It seems Purple Smile will take over teaching.”
“Teaching? But they didn’t do anything but watch. How can—”
