“To a point. The riots are contained in most cities, but she seems happy to let them run in Invrisil. I suppose that’s in contrast to Pallass. Grand Strategist Chaldion put the riots down hard.”
The [Innkeeper]’s heart sank.
“Chaldion did…? How hard is—hard? What about Saliss? I bet he didn’t do anything like that.”
“He is a Named Adventurer. Not the law.”
Maviola didn’t reply to Erin’s first question, which was telling. The [Innkeeper] looked around. Then she saw Visma’s mother hurrying over.
“Miss Solstice. Is Liscor safe? We’d like to check on our homes if it is.”
“Not yet. But soon. The Watch is outside—I’ll get people to check on it, okay? You just sit tight. Have something to eat. On the house.”
Erin soothed her. The many people in the room were nervous, but the Players were putting on comedy bits, and Lyonette was passing out free snacks and drinks. Erin sighed, sat back—
And Ishkr was there. The Gnoll hovered at Erin’s side.
“Erin. Miss Erin, have you heard about my sister? Liska?”
Erin sat up.
“Oh—Ishkr. I didn’t. I’ve asked, but she’s not at your apartment and no one else saw her…”
The Gnoll [Waiter] growled under his breath. Erin began to stand up.
“We can go look for her. Numbtongue, Beza—”
They glanced up. But the Gnoll shook his head. He hesitated, bent down.
“She—she may be with the rioters, Miss Erin. It would be like her.”
“Oh. Then should I…?”
“I’ll go look for her.”
The Gnoll wanted to go through the door, but everyone blocked him.
“My dear young…Gnoll. If your sister is with a mob, there’s nothing to do. Sit down, please. Ser Kerrig, perhaps you could go look. Even a mob is unlikely to stop you. Is there a description for this young Gnoll…woman?”
The Rose Knight nodded, donning his helmet. But Ishkr shook his head again.
“No. No. Thank you. I will wait. She’s probably with—it’s fine.”
He was glancing at Visma’s mother and around the room. Clearly nervous. Erin hesitated, but Ishkr strode off.
“I will help wait tables. Please let me know if you hear from her.”
“Of course. I’ll get Drassi to check.”
The [Innkeeper] looked around. She saw Drassi raise her head and glance at Ishkr. Then the Drake [Gossip] slid over to Erin.
“Um. Erin. I think Ishkr’s really worried. Liska might actually be with a riot. That’s like her. I can go through. I’ll stick to the safe zones.”
“You sure, Drassi? What’s Liska like? You know her? I’ve never even met her.”
Drassi rolled her eyes, indignant for a second.
“Erin, I know everyone. Yeah. Ishkr’s sister is two years younger. She’s uh…difficult.”
And that came from Drassi, who had few bad words about anyone. Erin frowned. They headed into the kitchen, where even Gnoll ears would have trouble if they whispered. Lyonette glanced at them as she pulled more pizzas out of the oven and distributed them for the guests.
“What’s wrong with Liska?”
“Oh—that’s why Ishkr doesn’t want anyone to find her but him or maybe you. She’s uh—well—I happen to know this, but you shouldn’t tell anyone. I haven’t! Obviously! Ishkr asked me not to. But she gets in trouble because she’s often with…female friends.”
Erin stared blankly at Drassi as the Drake [Gossip] looked uncomfortable.
“Okay. What kind of female friends? [Thieves]?”
“No, Erin. Female…friends.”
“Uh huh.”
The [Gossip] gave up. She leaned over.
“Turnscales, Erin.”
The [Innkeeper]’s eyes slowly narrowed. She…knew that word. But the meaning was…
“Why’s that bad?”
“She’s gotten arrested before. Look—it’s not my secret. Just—just don’t announce it. That’s why Ishkr doesn’t want her found in front of everyone.”
