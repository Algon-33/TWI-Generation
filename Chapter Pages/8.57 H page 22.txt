She sat there, tail slowly waving in the steam bath. Eloque’s neck frills began to open. So strange, as strange in her ways as a Stitch-person. But just Eloque. She looked ahead.
“I couldn’t join in the conversation with you all the other day.”
“Which one?”
“Futures.”
“Oh.”
Pisces tried to say something, but he just waited. Eloque looked past him.
“I don’t see mine. Bearig wants to go home. Qshom wants to start a business. They have classes, families. Dreams. Me? I came to Chandrar when I was young. Ten years. All I have is this class. The only thing I can do is—”
“You don’t have to do anything. I’m an adventurer. The items we looted from Igheriz are enough to make a living for a long time. You could travel wherever you want, and start afresh.”
Pisces spoke quickly. Eloque glanced at him.
“…Yes. But I can’t go home. My village sold me. I agreed to it, but I can’t go back there. Not with Roshal welcome on Baleros’ shores in most places. I could hide in a company that refuses to treat with them. But I don’t have a future.”
He had nothing to say to that. Eloque met his eyes.
“That’s not a bad thing. At least I can be worried about that. I used to know my future. So I wanted to say—thank you. To you and the Death of Chains. I thank her every night. I know she’s a Demon. But she killed Igheriz.”
“Yes. I thank her too.”
The Lizardwoman smiled brightly.
“I’ll leave you to scrubbing. You have some dirt behind your ears. Ears and noses. Humans are so funny.”
She stood up and left. Pisces felt rattled by the talk. What could he say? What could he have said? What could Erin have…
There is an inn. Believe me. You cannot imagine it, even as I describe it. There is an inn in a city far from here. It is not perfect, but it is what you need.
I will take you there. And someone will greet us at the door. I don’t care if she throws a pan at me.
By now, Pisces was waiting. He had gotten his arms and his neck, and he was actually cleaning his hair with little cupfulls of water from the [Condensation] spell when the next person came in.
It was Bearig. The man knocked on the door flaps, unlike the other two.
“Pisces? Do you mind sharing the tent?”
“Come on in, Bearig.”
Strangely, it was more uncomfortable as the [Cook] shuffled in. The two men stared at each other, and Bearig coughed; he had a towel too.
“I’m sorry for interrupting.”
“No, come in. It is large enough for…”
“I wouldn’t have, really. But the lines are getting long and I had to let Rophir wash himself. I don’t want to—”
“Not at all.”
He was the opposite of Merr. Too polite because he held Pisces in some regard. The [Necromancer] gestured, and Bearig sat. He was heavier-set than most, but he was losing weight. Pisces and Bearig eyed each other.
“So Eloque and Merr were both in here?”
“Ah—Eloque thought it was empty.”
“I saw her waiting in line.”
Their conversation was about as deep as a puddle. And that was why it was uncomfortable. Pisces hesitated. He liked Bearig. The man respected him.
That was not the same as his connection with Eloque and Merr. But they had been chained up together for a long time. Pisces knew Bearig’s back as well as…
Well. He tried to smile, and Bearig returned it. He relaxed.
That was all it took. Pisces saw Bearig pull something out.
“Do you have any soap?”
“I do. Thank you—”
They got to work. Bearig was fast, perhaps trying to respect Pisces’ time. To make conversation, Pisces stared blankly ahead. That snack was most excellent. We survived those Crystal Lights, didn’t we? How are you feeling? 
Nice weather today.
