“Emergency! We have someone from Earth dying of multiple arrow wounds. Poisoned. Is there any spell that can—”
The babble of voices—people finally moving—it was all too slow. Numbtongue stared at the ground. Red had already stained Erin’s clothes, absorbed by the grass. He pushed and she cried out once more. She was alive. Still alive.
“Can’t we do something to clot the injuries? I don’t know enough medicine! Take over! Joseph—Joseph—I have to make something to bind—”
Kevin was crying out. But his friend was stupefied.
“Embria! Get Embria here! Zevara! Get a [Healer] over here! They can stop the bleeding with Skills!”
Lyonette whirled again. She ran past a little figure. Mrsha was staring at the wound as Apista buzzed around, stinger extended.
This was a joke. Only, it wasn’t funny. Right? This wasn’t happening.
Not to Erin. Not again.
She reached out. Touched the blood as Erin gasped again. Mrsha jerked—stared at her paw.
Blood on her white fur. The Gnoll flung herself forwards. Clung to Erin. Was shoved away. Snapjaw snarled at her.
“Stay back! Get help!”
Mrsha turned. She ran past Moore. The half-Giant was whispering. But it was no spell. He had no magic.
“No, no—”
How long had it been? Numbtongue pressed, desperately trying to hold the blood back. But it kept seeping away.
“I’m dying. Aren’t…I…?”
Erin stared up. She saw—Beza, Snapjaw, Numbtongue—faces crowding around her. Shouting voices from so far away.
“No you’re not. Stay with us, Erin. [Healer]! What’s taking so long?”
Beza roared. But it had only been one minute.
Just a minute. And already—
Erin’s eyes slowly roamed, blinking. Searching the faces. She settled on Numbtongue.
“Are you crying?”
She blinked, almost tried to sit up. The Hobgoblin felt her warm blood, sticky on his palms.
“Stop, stop—need [Shaman]—stop, stop!”
Snapjaw was saying it like a…prayer. Badarrow was looking around.
“Erin? You must not be hurt. This is wrong.”
Bird stood there, bow in hand. Looking down at Erin, confused. He glanced around, and came to a slow conclusion.
“This is a bad dream. I must be dreaming. You cannot be hurt or I would be dead first—”
“I’m sorry. My fault.”
Numbtongue whispered. Erin blinked at him. Time—time was—
Not immortal. It was mortal. It was fading. She whispered, fighting for the words.
“No. I don’t want you to think that. It was an accident. I didn’t even see—who got me?”
“Drakes?”
“Really? I didn’t—why?”
She didn’t even know them. She didn’t know why. Erin thought that was really…she tried to laugh. Or smile. Her eyes roamed upwards.
Snapjaw slapped her.
“Stay awake!”
Badarrow made a sound. But Beza repeated the words.
“Stay awake!”
“Fetohep. The—we need some kind of magic. Octavia?”
Kevin was looking around. He and Snapjaw were trying to wrap cloth, hold the blood in with pressure and cloth—but the bolts were in the way. He looked at Snapjaw.
“Do you have tape? Glue? Anything. We can’t use our hands. We have to—”
“Octavia. What about a potion that clots blood?”
Joseph muttered. Kevin looked up.
“That’s right! There has to be. Go! Get one now!”
The [Kicker] looked at Kevin. The [Mechanic] screamed.
“Run, Joseph!”
The young man turned and lurched into a run. Numbtongue heard voices.
“—[Innkeeper] wounded. Poisoned arrows—get the Watch Captain. [Healer]! [Healer]!”
Two minutes. The Watch only heard now? They needed a [Healer]! Beza roared the same. Troy and Leon—Galina, Imani, were frozen outside the inn. Leon half-shook his head.
“They’re not going to make it.”
“Shut up. Don’t stand there!”
Octavia had returned.
