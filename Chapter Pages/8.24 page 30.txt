“Didn’t know. Thought a [General] would be smarter.”
“Ser Solstice? You killed the enemy [General]…?”
Markus stared, swaying a bit. Rabbiteater looked up and sprang to his feet.
“Markus. Your leg. Here.”
He offered a healing potion, but Markus ignored it. Rabbiteater looked up at the Spring Knight as Markus gave him a wide, slightly unhinged grin.
“How?”
“He was a [General]. Not Ailendamus’ best. Ser Solstice is as fine a warrior as any.”
Voost remarked. Rabbiteater shrugged with his characteristic modesty.
“No. Would have been harder. He was stupid. See?”
He pointed. Markus stared at the remains of the [General]’s head and hesitated. How…?
Rabbiteater explained as he shook his head.
“No helmet. Stupid, stupid.”

The first battle between the Order of Seasons and Ailendamus was an overwhelming victory. Vexil’s fault was not knowing the full-capabilities of a [Knight] charge.
Ailendamus would send another army. A better army. If there was one difference between an empire of its size and a smaller kingdom—it could afford to lose multiple armies. Not to mention tailor each one for a purpose.
Nevertheless, the Dawn Concordat celebrated the Order of Seasons, welcoming help at last. That was the news. The fact that an unknown [Knight] had slain the enemy [General] was a footnote, but it was a note. Most put it down to a foreign [Knight] joining the Order of Seasons.
Mrsha waved two little flags she’d written Rabbiteater’s name on wildly and cheered, again, silently. She danced around Rags.
Rabbiteater’s amazing! Rabbiteater’s awesome! I want to be a [Knight]!
Mrsha the Squire planned on bragging about it to Ekirra and Visma. She knew Rabbiteater! She would have run down to Liscor to find her friends, but Ekirra was still mad at her. Even though it was his fault!
She’d gotten in big trouble with Selys and Ishkr about that. However, that was yesterday-Mrsha’s problems.
Stinky Rags didn’t even want to talk with Mrsha, though. She was just whispering with Ulvama and Calescent. The [Chef] slurped some of his spicy-noodle with egg that was so tasty.
“Rabbiteater did good. Lots of [Knights]. Think he can get us armor?”
“Hm. Too far. Let him do what he wants. I’m more worried about [Knights]. Looks like Thunderbows are too weak. I need to revisit the plan, then.”
Ulvama just snorted.
“Don’t fight [Knights] on flat ground. Fight in tunnels and collapse roof on them.”
“Sometimes you have to fight them flat.”
Rags sighed. She rubbed at her head, frowning as she considered the battle and how she would have done it. Those [Summer Knights] were too much like the Rose Knights for her liking. Although…a bit less high-quality gear if some had gone down to arrows and whatnot. Less defense, more dangerous aura-abilities. She hadn’t thought to make Goblinhome flame-proof.
“Chieftain Rags, I have fought Izril [Knights]. Even Terandrian [Knights]. More importantly, I, Ulvama, can help you remember when Chieftains fought [Knights]. If I am your [Shaman].”
Ulvama smiled sweetly. Rags glanced at her. The [Shaman] was still trying to get a promise to come back with Rags. The Goblin Chieftain shrugged.
“Taganchiel can do the same. I can do it by myself as well.”
Ulvama’s smile turned into a scowl instantly.
“Taganchiel is chief shaman? That idiot?”
“Mhm. I will tell him you said hello.”
“Chieftain…”
Ulvama tried again, but she kept brushing away Mrsha. The little Gnoll saw the [Shaman] round on her.
“What, what?”
Mrsha held up a card. Ulvama stared at it.
 
Can you pwease enchant my fur with armor?
