“It’s just impulse, though.”
“Of course. That’s very revealing…and disturbing, sometimes. But I don’t see much wrong with you. That Drake is like a beacon, but there’s also other Drakes. First loves; childhood crushes don’t really count.”
“All Drake?”
“Two Gnolls.”
“Really? Who?”
“Er…close to black fur, a spot on the shoulder—”
Ilvriss turned red under his scales. He knew exactly who that was. Xesci watched with a slight smile. She tried to cover it, but then—
“Will you tell me? If I’ve told you this…”
He struggled, but she had been honest. At last, Ilvriss hung his head.
“I was a young man, and she was one of the staff in our employ. Always getting on my case about tracking mud in. I must have been…nineteen…”
He hadn’t even realized how attracted he was until she brought it up and the older Drake recalled the younger one’s viewpoint. She laughed.
“It’s always like that. And people ask for me to check.”
He took a deep breath.
“You’ll forgive me if I say that’s strange. Not—wrong—but strange.”
She nodded.
“That is fair. Two Gnolls, then.”
He knew the other one. He’d been curious. Ilvriss sat back.
“And anyone else?”
“One Human. But that’s another odd case.”
Her eyes flicked to his. He kept his face straight.
“I see.”
“If you want…?”
“No.”
The Drake wondered how accurate her Skill was. Or whether it was…it wasn’t like that. But he supposed it was.
He sat there for a while. But then he came to the real reason he’d come.
“Miss Xesci. Can you take on other…forms? Besides female, I mean. Can you become a male Drake? If you chose to?”
She froze. The [Courtesan] carefully eyed Ilvriss.
“If you are asking if I could…or have…Wall Lord, I would have to decline to comment.”
He glanced at the door at the same time as she did. This felt—wrong to discuss.
“I am not interested in any details, Miss Xesci. I am just asking if it is possible.”
She folded her arms. Which was an answer enough for him. He nodded.
“Let us change the subject, then. I wanted to know because…are there people you can’t sense anything from?”
The [Courtesan] hesitated. She narrowed her eyes, trying to figure out where he was going. But no offense to her co-worker—but the Drake didn’t seem as cunning as the knitting-Drake had been.
“I…have met people like that. Odd ones. They love no one and nothing. From time to time—I don’t use this on everyone, you understand. But I met an adventurer like that. He only wanted me to be the most beautiful person I could be. Then the next. And there have been—others. Why do you ask?”
Because, Miss Xesci, I need your help. The Wall Lord smiled thinly.
“Curiosity, Miss Xesci. Thank you. Would you describe the Human? Before I go. Just…”
She did. He listened. Then he left, paying her fee in full. The Wall Lord stood outside for a while.
A wedding ring.
Idiot.

“I’m sorry, Ilvriss. But it’s not a good time right now. That damned seditious [Painter] and their lies. Have you heard…?”
“Not at all, Wall Lord Rellmel. But let me assure you, I can pay whatever fee we can agree on. Up front.”
The Wall Lord’s eyes flickered, but he was shaking his head, even during the sit-down meeting with Ilvriss, Wall Lord to Wall Lord.
“I really can’t be selling artifacts, Ilvriss. I’m tempted, as a favor between fellow Wall Lords, but…my sister would throw ten kinds of fits. I’m sorry.”
Ilvriss sighed.
“What would it take for Gisha?”
“Honestly, Ilvriss? Too much to imagine. She’s paranoid about needing it. Well, it’s a Potion of—you know.”
