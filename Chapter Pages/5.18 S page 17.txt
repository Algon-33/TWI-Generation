“You need to decide for yourself. No moping! Get out there and make a choice, young one! And don’t let me catch you bothering the adventurers downstairs!”
“I know one I can bother.”
“Then go find them. But stay out of my Guild! Until work tomorrow. I expect you on time, escort and armor or not.”

There was no good way out. No right decision. Selys was trapped. And she hated everything. Right now she hated Pisces, despite him being very helpful of late.
“Try these command phrases next. ‘Ia curim law’. ‘What is will be and shall ever be the will of flame.’ Um…‘Drakes rule.’”
Pisces paced back and forth as Selys kept her hands on the Heartflame Breastplate. She looked up at him.
“Seriously? Drakes rule?”
“Any phrase could work, Selys. Any one at all. It’s the most nonsensical that would be chosen so no one would guess.”
“There’s no point. I give up.”
Selys leaned her cheek against the metal, not caring about smudging the legendary artifact anymore. Pisces turned to her.
“Don’t say that. Isn’t this exciting? The challenge. Imagine it! You could unlock the secrets of a powerful artifact today!”
His eyes gleamed. Selys just made a thbbting sound.
“It doesn’t matter. Someone else is going to get the armor. Let them have it.”
“Ah. So you’re inclined to sell?”
“I’m inclined not to die. Which means I have to sell at some point, only there’s no one I can sell it to that won’t make someone else mad! I’ll have to sell it and hire a [Bodyguard] for the rest of my life. How is that good?”
Pisces shrugged.
“You don’t have to sell it.”
“What? And keep it? Zevara won’t guard it forever—Relc’s already complaining about his job. [Thieves] will take it, or someone will kidnap me for it—what other options are there?”
“You could lend it—”
“Hah! That’s the same problem!”
“Not necessarily—”
“It doesn’t matter. I’ve got no choice.”
Selys turned her head away. She knew Pisces was trying to help, but she was just done with it all. Erin could handle something like this, but normal Selys had nothing. She’d just sell it to Embria. Or give it to Wistram. That was safe. Then she’d ask Zevara for protection…
What a mess. Selys leaned against the armor as she sensed Pisces coming over. He sat next to her quietly.
“Do you recall what I told you yesterday?”
“It’s not helping, Pisces.”
“Perhaps not. But you never gave me an answer. I asked you if you wanted this.”
“I don’t. Problem solved. Okay?”
Pisces didn’t move.
“That’s not a truthful answer. Truly, honestly, without the issue of pressure, do you want this armor?”
“It doesn’t matter!”
“I believe it does. You should make a choice that is honest to yourself.”
“Honest? Myself? Honestly, I don’t want this! I’m not special, Pisces! I’m not an adventurer like you!”
Selys raised her head. She wasn’t crying, but she was angry. She glared at the [Necromancer].
“I’m not meant for this. I’m just a [Receptionist]. This shouldn’t happen to me.”
“And yet it did. You may be Selys Shivertail, a [Receptionist], but your uncle was Zel Shivertail.”
“Don’t mention him. He’s not like me. He lived in a different world.”
Pisces raised his voice.
“So? You were part of that world. You can’t deny it! You may have only been his niece, but he cared about you enough to give you his armor!”
“It was a mistake!”
“It was his will. And you were part of his life! Enough so that he gave you this, even by mistake! You were part of a legend’s life, Selys. You can’t deny it.”
“Shut up!”
Selys thrust Pisces away. He retreated a bit, hurt. But he didn’t give up. He called at Selys as she wrapped her tail around her body.
