There is definitely more to say, though, so perhaps this is fine. Either way, I hope you enjoy! We are three chapters in and I’m already tired of counting.
But I might be getting back into the stride of things. At least, I am enjoying Gnoll culture—are you? The Meeting of Tribes was actually supposed to be before this…by like a Volume or two before I realized how much there is to say.
So it goes. But more Gnolls and people are meeting. And I’m sure there will not be any dramatic results from all of this.
Ahem. Thanks for reading and I’ll see you next time!
