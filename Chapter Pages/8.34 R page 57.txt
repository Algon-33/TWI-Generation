Author’s Note: When I write some chapters, I have an ‘arc’. I know how it ends. I know all the story beats. It’s different when I just write with all the plotlines and details I have.
It means sometimes, I write long because I want to get to my part. In this case? I expedited the plot like mad and barely got here.
I should probably wing it more. This is, ironically, the problem of prep.
And also the end of my writing month. I like to think of it like this. I have ‘back from break pirateaba’, who is warming up. Then ‘energy pirateaba’, who can write the best chapters of all. Then ‘tired aba’, which is now.
Everything goes down. All my stats. Writing endurance, happiness, my prose, such as it is, and all the rest.
But sometimes you just have to Relc a chapter. And we did. Is it perfect? No. But it’s Relc. That’s Relc-style.
…Hope you like it. One more chapter until I take my week break in August! Thanks for reading! That’s all, folks!
