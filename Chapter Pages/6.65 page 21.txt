“It’s been too long. I, running, and you, chasing. Unable to forget. So. Let’s end it, Mons. This old mistake between us. I am Pisces Jealnet, a [Mage] of Wistram. [Necromancer]. And I challenge you to a duel.”
Pisces pointed at Montressa. Beza let go of Montressa. Ceria breathed.
“No. Pisces—”
“I accept! Let’s finish this!”
Montressa grabbed her staff and strode forwards. Isceil followed her. Ceria cried out. Pisces’ face was pale as Montressa’s. But his eyes held a terrible truth. A certainty. And Montressa—she stepped forwards, and Ceria saw death in her eyes.
“No. Yvlon, help me. Ksmvr! Pisces—you can’t!”
The [Ice Mage] grabbed at Pisces’ arm. But Yvlon stepped past Ceria, knocking her arm aside.
“They won’t stop. Pisces is right, Ceria.”
She drew her sword. The adventurers fell back as Yvlon lifted the enchanted blade in both hands. She pointed at Beza.
“Come on, Minotaur. Come, or don’t haunt our backs ever again. If you believe what your friend says. If you want to take Pisces—step forwards. Because you’ll go through me.”
“This is a duel!”
Beza hesitated. Yvlon’s gaze never wavered. The same fury in Montressa’s eyes was reflected in hers.
“Then let it be. Between our teams. Step forwards or forswear hunting Pisces! I’m tired too. He hasn’t deserved this. Come on! What about you? Or you?”
She pointed at Palt and Ulinde. The Centaur backed up.
“No. Montressa, pull back.”
“I—I can’t. Palt is right. Beza!”
The Minotauress hesitated. But then Isceil spoke up. He lifted his wand and walked up next to Montressa. He pointed with his free hand at Ceria.
“They still tell stories about a monster who was one of our Archmages. He had friends, until they saw what he was. But they did see when they looked. His evil heart. His wretched lies. Step aside, half-Elf. I see a monster.”
“Stop! The Academy won’t allow it!”
Palt tried to trot forwards. But Beza’s arm stopped him. The Minotauress had made her decision. She reached for the scrolls at her belt.
“Honor matters more than the laws of Wistram, Palt. I’ve seen the death this creature caused. And others like him. I don’t believe him. And I won’t let my team fight alone.”
“Ceria—”
“Pisces. You can’t do this.”
“Then I should let her attack again? Attack Erin? Look at her, Ceria. She will do anything. I won’t let it happen.”
Ceria looked. Montressa stared at her, wild-eyed. She had lost something. Slowly, in a dream of her own, Ceria let go of Pisces’ sleeve. She looked around.
“Step back, then. Alais. Stan.”
“Ceria! You can’t do this.”
“I’m not letting Pisces die.”
How did it come to this? But look—look at her eyes. Ceria had seen a reflection of them somewhere. Where?
Illphres. Do or die. Montressa would never give up. Something was broken in her. Or—she was gone. Even if Ceria ran, she’d attack. Where had her friend gone? Ceria looked for her, but she couldn’t find the girl she knew.
“A duel?”
“Fall back.”
The adventurers were hesitating. Stan looked around.
“Move back! Clear the area!”
“We can’t let them duel—”
“It’s that or fight. Neither’s backing down. Look at them, Alais. Get out of range! They use lightning spells!”
The adventurers were falling backwards as the Horns and the Wistram [Mages] slowly walked to the right. Towards the Blood Fields, away from the road.
“I’ll take Beza.”
Yvlon’s voice was cold. Ceria looked at her, then at Pisces.
“It doesn’t have to be like—”
She looked at Isceil and her voice trailed off. The Drake was aiming his wand at Pisces’ heart, a smile on his face. Ceria took a breath.
“I’ll stop the Drake, then.”
“Fine.”
