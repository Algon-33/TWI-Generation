“You need what?”
Calvaron stared at Ceria as she panted and tried to explain. He and Beatrice were standing outside of the large room they’d chosen to party in. Ceria could hear loud voices through the stone walls, but she had no time for drinking.
“Please, Calvaron. I need to take some stuff out of the kitchens, but the [Cook] there said I needed to get permission from the head [Chef] or pay. And I don’t have the coin! Please—I’ll pay you back.”
“Can it wait? We’re celebrating, Ceria! You should too!”
Calvaron stared back towards the party. He pointed into the room.
“Pisces is already drunk. I had to practically pour a bottle of wine down his throat so he wouldn’t go looking for you. Come on, whatever it is, it can wait!”
“No, it can’t. Please, Calvaron. I know I don’t have anything I can trade you, but—”
Beatrice looked at Ceria’s pleading face, and then nudged Calvaron. He blew out his cheeks, but nodded.
“Oh—fine! Tell the [Cook] that you can take whatever you need. Put it on my account.”
“Thank you! Thank you! Tell Pisces I’m fine! I’ve just got to go!”
Ceria raced off. Calvaron watched her go and turned to Beatrice.
“What in the name of the Great Companies was that, do you think?”
Beatrice shrugged. She stared at the place where Ceria had been.
“Should we go after her? She’s very upset.”
“I don’t know. No—she’s got a plan. We’d better let her do what she needs to do and not draw attention. But see if the bookies will take another bet, will you? I’m thinking our dear Springwalker might have better odds than we think.”
