“They look…like nature spells. Hold on, I’m pretty sure that one’s [Stone Armor]. See? There’s an illustration.”
Krshia nodded.
“What do you think?”
“I think…this spellbook is organized by elements. No—wait—spell schools. And that would mean these are Tier 4—or Tier 3—attack spells. And these are…illusions…”
Lyonette was going through the book. Krshia made a quick note.
“And this section?”
“Enchantments.”
Lyonette stared at a page, which was both illustration and word. Magical writing. She paused.
“Krshia—can you let me try to learn this spell? It might be—it looks like it’s a spell I know from home.”
“Which one?”
“Here. If it is—it’s [Silverglow Enchantment]; it makes a sword capable of cutting spirits.”
“Really? That is useful. Against undead, yes?”
“I hear it’s good against Djinn as well. And non-corporeal foes. Or maybe—this one?”
Lyonette wavered. She’d spotted another spell as she went to attack spells.
“[Lightning Bolt]. That’s definitely it.”
“Another good spell. Do you think you can learn it?”
“I don’t know.”
If she could—and if she could, really, which was the best spell to try for? Lyonette stared at the spells again. And she began to get worried. Which one? Which…
Another spell caught her eye. Lyonette paused.
“…How about this one? I’ve heard of [Mages] using it. And it has a number of uses.”
“Hrm? Which one.”
“This. Right here. It’s wind-magic. [Razorwind].”
“…Seems much like [Lightning Bolt]. Except less useful, yes?”
“No, no. It’s Tier 3. But it’s not just sharp wind. It’s got utility. Let me try…learning it. You can compress the wind, use it as a shield. I can always try the other enchantments later.”
“Very well. If you can learn, it has some use here. Go ahead. Hrm. Perhaps a table? Mrsha takes a long time learning.”
“Okay. Here I go.”
Lyonette put the book on the table. She stared at the magical spell. Instantly—her head began to hurt. The magic was trying to embed itself in her head. And her mind was ill-prepared to accept it.
Even so—Lyonette realized the words made a lot more sense than even the Tier 1 and Tier 0 spells her [Tutors] had tried to teach her. Her Skill was working.
It was just that this was Tier 3. The [Princess] felt a trickle from her nose as she tried to memorize.
“Nosebleed. Here. Perhaps you should rest, Lyonette? It has been forty minutes.”
Krshia offered Lyonette a tissue. The [Princess] looked up.
“Forty…? It feels…no. No, I think I can do this. I’m going to try something else. Give another try?”
The Gnoll nodded. And so the [Princess] took a breath. She looked down and whispered.
“[Flawless Attempt].”
And her mind—focused. Krshia Silverfang saw the young woman’s pupils widen. And she felt something in the air. She looked at Lyonette. And in the closed room, the air began to move. The Gnoll stared at Lyonette. Time ran past the young woman as she read.
Her mind felt focused, as if she’d taken some kind of potion to enhance her concentration. And the magic was revealing itself to her. Imprinting itself in her brain. She raised her hand.
Yes. The wind can be as sharp as a razor. As mutable as thought. More than water. But it changes. Look. You can compress it; turn it into a shield, a weapon. But only for a breath. Concentrate. To know how to make a blade with air, you have to know what it is to cut—
“I need to cut myself. Where’s my sword?”
Lyonette found herself muttering. She felt someone shaking her. And she came to herself with Krshia’s knife in one hand. The Gnoll was holding her arm.
“No. Lyonette?”
