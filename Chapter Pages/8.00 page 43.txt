Fire? Gnolls were so strange. But it hadn’t burned her. It was on her paw. Now, where had that come from? Ulvama backed up. But she still saw it flickering. It had leapt at her. The child still held it.
As the Goblin left, and the child slumbered, and the world changed, it continued to burn. The legend of The Wandering Inn was not ended. And the fire still burned.
It flickered like…
Hope.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: This is the first chapter of Volume 8. And I’ve realized that the first chapters are harder than the last. Because I know exactly how the volume ends. But starting one? Harder. Because there are so many things to do, but how do you start?
I hope it was good. As I wrote at the top, Andrea is beginning to record on Monday—and I am writing!
And The Wandering Inn won a Stabby! It is the third and last we will ever win (because you can’t win more than three in a category), but three more than I ever thought we’d achieve! It was a huge honor, and I have you all to thank for it. The post is here, and I thank you for still voting and reading.
Volume 7 has ended, but you’re still here after that. Let’s see how Volume 8 goes. Thanks once more, and see you next chapter. I’m just getting back into gear. Until next time!
