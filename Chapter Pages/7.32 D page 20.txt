[Geneva] – Do you have warrior classes? How do you protect yourself?
[Joseph] – I don’t fight if I don’t have to. I have friends. Adventurers, from this world. They’ve died fighting monsters. I’m not that strong. The Watch—the law enforcement, friends, adventurers, fight. But a city will not protect you. You need a safe place. You need to prepare.
 
Erin was holding Numbtongue’s hand. He looked at her as she spoke.
 
[Joseph] – There are dungeons full of monsters. Huge ones with magical powers that can terrify you. Flying ones the size of houses. You need to be careful.
[Geneva] – I am. I have protection with me. There are others, as I said. We are relatively safe. Are you safe?
[Joseph] – Yes. Thank you. It was rougher when I first came here. I’ve found a place to stay. Allies.
[Geneva] – When we came here, my group and I were teleported close to a battlefield. Some were from an airport. Melbourne. I was not. But I have been on battlefields. As a [Doctor], I do not fight. Many of the others died, however.
[Joseph] – I see. Armies are different. Monsters, though…it must have been hard.
 
What a simple statement. But the United Nations company sat there for a moment. Because it was true. And they felt…the other side knew it.
 
[Geneva] – It was. We have survived. But this world is dangerous.
[Joseph] – Wonderful and dangerous.
[Geneva] – Yes. It is. We find more of us. Some do not survive. But we are looking.
[Joseph] – That is good. I am looking too. If I find them, I will protect them as best I can. I did not think to talk to anyone outside of Izril, however. Listen: do you need any help?
[Geneva] – Us?
[Joseph] – Anything I can do. I have gold. If you need something, I can try to get it to you. We must be careful. But I can ask the faction in Wistram. If you are in danger, let me know and I can try to get to you somehow.
 
The United Nations company sat there, rereading the [Message]. It was so…confident.
“Him? Help us? With what, football?”
 
[Geneva] – We should be fine, thank you. We are mostly concerned with gathering information. How we all got here, for instance.
[Joseph] – I’ll tell you what I know. Which isn’t much.
[Geneva] – Thank you.
 
A brief exchange. Erin sat back.
“Darn.”
 
[Joseph] – No other clues?
[Geneva] – None. We thought it was a spell.
[Joseph] – The [Mages] from Wistram don’t know anything about that.
[Geneva] – Too bad.
[Joseph] – Mhm. Perhaps there is a way we can meet in the future. You are very far away. But I may be able to buy a ship or something.
[Geneva] – Or something?
[Joseph] – I’ll look into it. Talenqual is far away.
 
Erin was staring at a map.
 
[Joseph] – Like I said, there’s not much I can do for you from here. But I can send gold, or figure out ways to give you things you might need. If you’re a [Doctor], do you need scalpels or surgical instruments? I know an expert [Blacksmith] who can probably create medical-grade equipment. And an [Enchanter]. Transporting it is an issue, but…
[Geneva] – Are you serious?
[Joseph] – Absolutely.
 
The United Nations company exchanged glances.
 
[Geneva] – Out of curiosity, what level are you?
[Joseph] – : ) What about you?
 
The [Mage] had to write that one down. The [Doctor] herself smiled.
 
[Geneva] – I’m decently high-level myself. I wish I was better, though. People are dying. Even with my Skills. : /
[Joseph] – Don’t give up! This world needs [Doctors]! \o/
 
Ulinde snapped.
“Stop making me send pictures! It’s too hard!”
“Sorry.”
