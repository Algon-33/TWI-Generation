Rose began singing as a new song came on. To the curious, Stolen Dance, on Kevin’s computer became the iconic Hotel California. As the young woman’s voice tried to capture the lyrics—which she did know—Numbtongue stopped playing.
“Rose, this is about the guitar, the guitar. Not singing.”
Kevin objected. As Rose protested, Galina sat at the back of the inn. So far away that the music wasn’t even really audible. And over here there was far less noise. She whispered to the ugly Drake sitting next to her.
“So they do this every night?”
“And they practice! This is Lady Macbeth.”
“Lady Macbeth?”
Relc grinned at Galina. The two were bitten by the stage. They watched as the Players of Liscor began to warm up. The Players of Invrisil were back to work in their city, and neither Relc or Galina had, as of yet, visited the city.
But Relc was going to go as soon as he got a longer break. He certainly had the gold for it. He jingled the full coin pouch at his side. He nodded to Temile ordering the [Actors] about.
“Yup. See, this is a take on the classic Macbeth. Do you know it?”
“Know it? I performed it! Twice. Back in High…do these [Actors] take…notes? How many plays do they know? Have they ever done Wicked? What about—Phantom of the Opera? Mean Girls? Oh my god. Has Erin taught them Chicago? Please tell me yes.”
The [Guardsman] looked at Galina. Temile glanced up. And another victim of the theatre joined the others. Galina had been too shy to confess her addiction. But Joseph was the first—he would not be the last.
“You know…more plays?”
“Anastasia. Um—To Kill a Mockingbird. I know lots. Not perfectly—how did Erin remember them?”
“Skills, duh. Hey, Temile. Get over here!”
Galina saw the [Producer] hurry over. And another of Magnolia’s discarded children began to shine. If someone found her sparks, they caught fire.

“…and she’s a Vampire. Pointed teeth. Hates the sunlight. Literally allergic to garlic.”
Ryoka Griffin sat in the Garden of Sanctuary. Mrsha sat on her lap. Erin’s jaw was open.
“You’re sure?”
“She has red eyes, her family drinks animal blood, and she once threw me like a ragdoll. Pretty sure, Erin.”
“No way. They’re real?”
Mrsha looked up at Ryoka and urgently patted her leg. She wanted to know more! Ryoka felt the need to caution them again.
“This is absolutely secret. Erin. You can’t tell anyone, Mrsha. You know that. Right?”
The Gnoll nodded, as if this was in jeopardy. Well—she was learning to write. Ryoka continued.
“I’m only telling because…you should know where I’ve been. But you can’t tell anyone. Erin.”
“I wasn’t gonna! But that’s so cool! And scary? Do they—”
“They don’t sparkle. They burn up in the sun. Not immediately. Old Vampires apparently literally turned to dust, or caught fire. And they’re…sick. All of them. I think…”
Ryoka felt at the tiny vial at her side. She thought of Teriarch’s words.
“I don’t know what it is. I have something that might help, Fierre, though. And I told her I’d come back. I have to go back.”
She felt two tiny arms encircle her stomach with surprising strength. Mrsha grabbed onto Ryoka and looked up. The City Runner hesitated. She patted Mrsha’s head.
“…Not yet. And Reizmelt isn’t that far from Invrisil. If I’d known, I would have just gone to Invrisil. I can visit. But I have to go back.”
“Can’t you…bring Fierre here?”
Erin spoke wistfully. Ryoka glanced at her, amused.
“She’d never go for that. She has a job in Reizmelt. She couldn’t just…”
Ryoka trailed off. Both Alber and Fierre had careers of moving about. Even so—she shook her head.
