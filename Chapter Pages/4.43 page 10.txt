After a while, Krshia spoke again.
“It is curious how you were able to make Brunkr a [Knight], though. He said you spoke only a few words and he gained the class that night. Is it truly so easy?”
Lyonette hesitated. But now was not the time to keep royal secrets. She nodded.
“It’s…well, it’s not supposed to be that simple, you understand. But in practice you can make someone a [Knight] with only a few words. It’s usually a matter of ceremony because it’s so important, but if you’re in a hurry you can skip all that. At least…I can. I think [Lords] have to work harder at it, you know, have a crest, induct the person into their service and so on.”
“But a [Princess] is able to do the same more easily? Because your class is superior?”
“Maybe…well, no. I think Mother explained it once. You see, a [Princess] has a different role from a [Lord]. They have their own households, vassals, and so on, so they can support quite a lot of [Knights] depending on how rich and powerful they are. Whereas even a high-level [Princess] has a limit on the amount of [Knights] she can appoint. Mine are personal protectors, you see, so I can choose them quickly and as I please, whereas a [Lord]…”
“Must set up such circumstances. So I see. That is fascinating.”
Krshia nodded. Lyonette smiled and went on.
“It’s a feature of royal classes. Obviously a [King] can appoint a lot more classes, like [King’s Champion], specialized knighthood orders and so on. I can’t do any of that—the only other thing I can do is royally appoint some business I like.”
Krshia had been chewing at her raw meat. Now she paused and gulped.
“Royally appoint? I am not familiar with this.”
“It’s simple. I can bestow a royal class on someone. Like…say you’re a [Gardener], right? If I want, I could make that person a [Royal Gardener]. Although that’s rare and I can probably only do that for one person. Father has a [Royal Chamberlain], but it’s not common to do. Although it does help!”
“I imagine it would. Such a class…hrr. Am I right in thinking it offers better Skills, or perhaps more unique ones?”
Lyonette nodded cautiously, trying to dredge up half-remembered lessons.
“I think so. It’s just an addition, so you can change classes and transform it like normal. It just makes, you, well, better.”
She paused as Krshia mulled this over, and then had a crazy thought. She spoke before her courage failed her.
“Would you like me to give one to you?”
Krshia choked on her tea and nearly sprayed it all over Lyonette. When she’d finished coughing, she looked at the [Princess].
“You are joking.”
“No.”
Lyonette met her gaze, her legs trembling wildly.
“I’m serious. I could give it to you if you want.”
“Why? I am not your subject. And such a gift—”
“I gave Brunkr a [Knight] class. I think…well, I just think that he’d want me to help you if I could. And that’s the only thing I can do.”
Krshia looked at Lyonette. She sat back in her chair, speechless. When she spoke, it was distantly.
“Say I accept. I would receive a royal title and…nothing else? It would be a gift, yes, not an obligation?”
Lyonette hesitated. She frowned and gulped some tea.
“I don’t know. It’s been years—decades, really since my family gave their blessing to anyone. We make [Knights] and [Lords] and so on, but businesses are different. It’s…I can remember my grandmother knew a fruit seller who she made royal. I think it helped her business, but I can’t remember if it did anything else. You don’t have to, I’m just offering…”
