Interlude – A Night in the Inn

His eyes were wide, his mouth agape. Gasping for air, but his lungs didn’t move.
The mithril coin lay next to him. Erin’s black flames—flickered.
“Pelt?”
The Dwarf was twitching. The coin—glittered in the moonlight. It lay on the ground, where Pelt had dropped it. And Erin saw.
The Dwarf had begun restoring it. Erin saw a shining city. Half re-made, the tiny, delicate details given clarity by Pelt’s metalworking tools.
An empire. Symbols of an old nation. A sun rose behind a city. But that was not where it had stopped.
Around the rim of the coin were words.
Letters, delicate. But visible. Erin read them in between Pelt’s choking. A phrase on the minted coin. Or an epitaph to a long-forgotten kingdom.
So old that the mithril had worn with time. And yet, Pelt, the master, had restored it. Almost all of it.
And the words. Shone.
 
Tamaroth, Who Leads. The G— of Rulers. Protect Us in Our Weakness.
 
That one word. Pelt had managed to recreate a single letter of it. But the rest was—scratched out. His shaking hand, so perfectly steady in everything else, had damaged the rest of the word.
Erin Solstice saw this all in a moment, between the Dwarf’s seizing chest, clawed hands. That one word. The flames around her went out. She looked at Pelt. His eyes were wide. He wasn’t breathing.
She took the coin and shoved it in a pocket. And then she screamed for help.

Later. The flames were gone. Erin Solstice sat, shaking, in Pelt’s forge. The Dwarf was breathing. Coughing. But breathing.
Alive. Saliss knelt next to him—and Ceria, Pisces—Venim—all the people who’d come after Erin. [Smiths] too—the Watch was keeping them back.
The important part was that Pelt was alive. Alive. Erin had found him scarcely a minute after he’d collapsed.
Working on the coin. The scratched out word burned in Erin’s head. The coin felt red-hot in her pocket.
Her flames of hatred were extinguished. Erin hugged Pelt as he coughed and pushed her off him.
“I’m so—glad you’re okay. And I’m so sorry.”
“I just froze up. I started breathing! You didn’t need to pound on my damn chest!”
The [Blacksmith] coughed again. He’d started breathing after the coin was removed. Saliss was offering Pelt a bottle of compressed air.
“Breathe into this. What happened?”
Erin opened and closed her mouth. But the Dwarf just thrust aside the bottle.
“Just an accident at the forge. Too many damn distractions. That was all. I needed a break. Somewhere quieter to work. Said it for years.”
He and she said nothing of the coin. Pelt didn’t even look at Erin. Trembling, he put his tools away.
“Big fuss over nothing.”
Watch Captain Venim sighed. Pelt passed a hand over his eyes.
“Nothing. I saw nothing. Can’t even remember. If I think of it—”
His breath caught in his throat. He choked—everyone reached for him. But the Dwarf started breathing again.
“Nothing happened.”
His gaze was blank. Nothing. Erin met his eyes for a moment. She backed away and Pelt looked around.
“Why did you come here, Erin?”
“I wanted to…”
She’d wanted a knife. But Erin—her desire was extinguished along with the dark thoughts. The hatred was gone. She had looked into Pelt’s face and been terrified for him. She was…she liked to believe she couldn’t kill like that.
But part of her knew otherwise. Something had to change. She’d been blindsided by Magnolia because the [Lady] had planned for her. And Erin—she hadn’t. It was as simple as that.
Vision. Magnolia had once told Erin something like that.
Save the world. But Erin couldn’t even beat Magnolia at Magnolia’s game. At chess, yes. But Magnolia’s board was vaster than Erin’s.
