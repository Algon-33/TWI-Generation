The army had halted in its tracks. Headscratcher stared at the army and shrugged.
“Could. But could stay. Could fight. That what we talked about. Goblin Lord. Bad Goblin. Could fight him. All of us.”
“But you didn’t. You chose to run.”
Erin looked at Headscratcher. He smiled again.
“We did. But then saw you. Heard you stay. So we changed minds.”
“Who did?”
“We did.”
“Who—”
And then Erin saw someone else climbing the hill out of the corner of her eye. She turned and saw a familiar Goblin carrying a guitar walk past her. Numbtongue grabbed the flag with Headscratcher. He looked down at Erin.
“Hi.”
“Numbtongue?”
Not just him. A pair of Goblins walked past Erin. Shorthilt and Badarrow. The two stepped into place. Badarrow checked his bow and then grabbed part of the pole. So did Shorthilt.
“But I thought—you were a—”
“Sneaky Goblins.”
Shorthilt winked at Erin. And a fifth Goblin trudged up the hill. He wore chainmail that shone in the light. His cloak of wine billowed in an imaginary wind. And he smiled when he saw Erin’s face.
“Rabbiteater.”
“Saw flag.”
The Hob bent down and offered Erin a hand. Dazed, she took it, and the Hob hauled her up. He walked forwards towards the flag and put a hand on it. The five Hobs lifted the flag into the air. Erin stared at them.
“You guys came back? Why?”
Headscratcher shrugged.
“Heard you were going to fight. Heard you were going to stay.”
“I—yeah, but, no, but—who told you that?”
The Hobs looked at each other. Numbtongue answered at the same time as Rabbiteater.
“Somebody.”
“Pebblesnatch.”
Numbtongue scowled. He kicked Rabbiteater in the shins. Rabbiteater swore. Erin looked at them.
“She told you I was going to fight? I wasn’t. I—I was trying to stop the fighting. Not start more!”
Headscratcher looked confused. He pointed up at the white banner.
“But you have flag.”
“Yes! A white flag!”
“Right. Nice color. But turn red very quick.”
“That’s not—”
Erin stared at the flag. Then she looked at Headscratcher and the others. She took a deep breath.
“Headscratcher, white flags aren’t the same as other flags. They don’t mean it’s time for war. They’re a sign of peace. You don’t fight under them.”
The Redfangs looked at each other. Headscratcher’s jaw dropped. He looked at the flag, and then Erin, and then back again.
“Oh.”
“Oops.”
Badarrow agreed. He seemed amused, because he slapped Shorthilt on the shoulder and chortled. The other Hob grinned. Erin looked at them. The five laughed. They’d made a mistake! They laughed and grinned as if they knew some giant joke.
“What’s so funny? We should run! It’s all over. The Goblin Lord’s going to attack and we’re going to die.”
“Really?”
Headscratcher looked down at Erin. She nodded.
“There’s no hope. There’s too many of them.”
Shorthilt cast a dismissive glance at the Goblin army.
“Not that many.”
“Yes, that many! How are you going to try and fight them? There are six of us and a million of them!”
“More than six.”
“No, Numbtongue, not more than—”
Erin stopped. She looked suspiciously at Numbtongue. Then at the other Redfangs. They were all laughing, grinning at something. Behind Erin. She slowly looked at them and then felt a tingling on the back of her neck.
“Wait. Was it just you who came back?”
“No.”
“How many, then? How many decided to turn around?”
The question stumped the Goblins. Rabbiteater started counting. Badarrow shrugged. Numbtongue and Shorthilt exchanged amused glances. And Headscratcher smiled. He let go of the flag and walked over to Erin. Slowly, he turned her around.
“All of us.”
