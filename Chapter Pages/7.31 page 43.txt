Lord Alman’s voice was low. He panted. The street was clear for a second. A group of [Maids] and [Butlers] had ridden wagons in front of the last crowd, blocking them. But even Magnolia’s servants—if that had been them—were fleeing the fury.
“Magnolia has to help us. If we die like dogs—our Houses will declare a blood feud!”
Lord Ranga struck his horse’s saddle. The stallion reared and he nearly fell off. The other [Lords] nodded. But—Toldos limped behind the others, his face gray.
“She’s miscalculated. Magnolia likes tidy plans. She doesn’t know riots. She might send her golems in after us, but I think she’s lost control.”
The others looked at him. That was an unwelcome assessment. Before they could suggest anything though—the riots found them.

“Let us in!”
Lord Ranga pounded on a door as the crowds advanced. The [Shopkeeper] refused to open up. Alman grabbed Ranga—someone had shot his horse.
“Ranga, we have to move! Grab Mel and follow us!”
The [Lords] picked up Mel. No more arrows flew. The crowd was advancing…slowly.
Were they wary of the [Lord] and their bodyguard’s blades? The two dozen men were outnumbered hundreds to one. Slowly, they backed up, hurrying down the street.
Another crowd came down it. This time the [Lords] were trapped. From her rooftop, Ressa cursed. She crouched. She’d been trying to steer them, but Invrisil had been boiling like a rat’s nest and the [Lords] had kept going in circles.
“Magnolia. They’re cornered.”
“Ressa. They must not die. Teriarch. Can you teleport them out?”
“If you know each of their names, yes. Otherwise, I can fly over there and lift them to safety. But that would be obvious. And Wistram is already pestering Grand Mage Eldavin. I won’t get tangled up in politics.”
The Dragon’s voice was testy from the other end of the speaking stone. Magnolia cursed at him.
“Ressa. Do not let them die.”
“What do you want me to do? I have stunning vials. I can drop one crowd. But if they charge in, I’ll have to go down myself.”
Ressa had the poisoned blade that Regis Reinhart had given her. If she went down—people died. Magnolia fell silent. Teriarch was listening. Ressa waited. The voice, when it came, was distant.
“Do not let them die, Ressa.”
“Acknowledged.”
“Reinhart! That would be a sl—alright, I’m going. Where are they? Wait, I’ll scry Ressa and teleport to—”
Sounds from the other end of the stone. Ressa put it away distantly. Teriarch might not make it. She focused down on the crowd. Either way—
The [Maid] had changed clothes. At least she looked like an [Assassin] now. She drew the blade. And waited.

Below. The crowd was more like a predator. It rolled forwards slowly as the [Lords] backed up. They were offering threats, demanding passage. It was ignored.
“Kill them. Vengeance!”
“Vengeance!”
The crowd echoed it. For what? Well—something to do with the Golden Triangle. Being sent against Magnolia Reinhart.
“We’re tired of noble’s tricks! They killed some of us!”
Bodyguards dead. They had killed one [Lord]. Magnolia hadn’t reached him in time. The silent advance from both sides forced the [Lords] into a ring.
These were the consequences. Of what? Well—just consequences.
No Wistram broadcast here. Sir Relz and Noass had fled the violence. This—this crowd was ready for blood.
“Stay back! We are [Lords] of Izril. By right, we rule you! We settled these lands!”
Lord Ranga bellowed. It was an amazingly stupid thing to say. Someone laughed.
“First you, then your Rhir-taken house!”
The [Lord] paled. There was a cheer from the crowd.
“Yes!”
“Justice!”
