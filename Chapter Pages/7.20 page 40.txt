“No way! It’s there! The Horns are there! Everyone! Where’s Numbtongue? Lyonette? Mrsha, the Horns are in Invrisil!”
“And the Players of Celum! Wesle, Jasi! Emme! Someone grab the door!”
Temile leapt off the stage. The [Actors] shouted and poured forwards. And the inn exploded into motion. Mrsha leapt out of the Garden of Sanctuary as Visma peeked out of it. Numbtongue poked his head out of the kitchen.
“Someone go tell Relc! And Selys! And Krshia and—”
“On it!”
Drassi raced out towards the hallway, gleeful as a [Gossip] could be. Someone swore.
“I’d better tell the Watch Captain! And the Council!”
Beilmark raced after her. The Senior Guardswoman charged out. Erin looked around.
“Get the door! Get the—”
The [Actors] rushed back into the common room, holding the magical door. Erin saw Lyonette hurrying downstairs with Pawn. And Belgrade and Bird—they’d been making a Fortress of Fluff for Pawn. Nothing untoward. This time.
“The door to Invrisil?”
Grimalkin stood up. He looked around the inn as Erin pointed at the door. Lyonette was shouting.
“The ice cream! Get the ice cream, Ishkr! We’re going to sell everything!”
“Someone get the Halfseekers! In Pallass!”
Erin was laughing. She hurried over to the door.
“Everyone outta the way! I’m gonna open it!”
“Hold on. Everyone’s not here yet!”
“Erin! Wait! We need to get ready for the rush! Ishkr, we need all staff here!”
“Access to Invrisil will change how Pallass sees The Wandering Inn. Erin Solstice—”
Grimalkin was cautioning her. He tried to move forwards and a Gnoll bounced off his head. Grimalkin stared at Mrsha. She crawled over his shoulder and over Temile’s head.
“Someone get my ‘No Killing Goblins’ sign! I’m gonna open it! Apparently everyone’s with the Players!”
“Invrisil.”
Palt murmured to Montressa. She and Bezale stared as Erin adjusted the dial.
Too soon. No one was ready! The Council of Liscor exploded out of their seats.
“Stop that insane Human! We need to regulate this!”
Lism roared. Even Krshia was cursing and rushing out the door. Relc threw down his spear.
“I’m on duty! Watch Captain—”
“Get to the inn, Relc!”
“Really?”
The Drake brightened. Zevara roared and pointed.
“Get me a platoon to that inn! Before that [Innkeeper] does something!”
They all ran, cursing, laughing, expectant. Liscor’s inhabitants flooded after them.
“Now this is the crazy Human I know. About time!”
A Gnoll remarked as Selys pushed forwards, through the gates since the magical door was broken. And it was too late to stop.
Erin Solstice adjusted the magical mana stones. She threw open the door. She blinked.
“Whoops, wrong setting. This one.”
She closed the door, adjusted the dial. The inn roared. Laughter, excitement, a hundred little stories. It all came together. Erin Solstice, the [Innkeeper], chaos, threw open the door.
The Crazy Human of Liscor. And the doorway flickered to life. Another room appeared. And there she was. And no one was prepared for her.
“Hello, Invris—”
Erin Solstice paused. She blinked. And then she took a step back. The crowd froze. And someone stepped through the doorway.
Her. 
Lady Magnolia Reinhart. She looked at Erin Solstice as the young woman blinked up at her.
In the inn, Redit blinked at the sword Reynold was pointing at his throat. The Players of Celum, the Earthworlders, the adventurers stared as two [Ladies] walked forwards.
Lady Pryde, and Lady Wuvren. Ressa glanced at Imani and nodded once. And they walked through into Liscor.
And there she was. Unprepared for. Unlooked for. Lady Magnolia looked around the inn. Every eye fell on her.
