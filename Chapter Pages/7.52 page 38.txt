“You killed Gnolls. Gnolls who had families. You know families?”
“Yes. Raskghar have…bigger Raskghar make smaller Raskghar.”
Asoma gestured, spreading her legs and pulling aside a corroded leather skirt—Erin looked away. She looked at Asoma.
“Yes. The Gnolls had parents. Children. Family. You killed them. Do you feel sorry for that?”
The Raskghar opened her mouth. She looked at Erin, and saw the young woman peering at her intently. I will know if you lie. She considered this. Erin broke into the silence again.
“Do you have a—no. Do you have a—mate? A favorite Raskghar?”
“Yes. There.”
Asoma pointed. Erin didn’t look. That was true. One of the [Guards] had produced a truth stone and was consulting it.
“Would you be sad if that Raskghar died?”
A worried growl. Asoma wasn’t worried, though. Her eyes flickered to Erin’s face and she nodded.
“Yes. Sad.”
They were getting somewhere. But again—animals could be sad. As much as people, more, perhaps. Erin didn’t know.
But sorry?
“You killed Gnolls. Gnolls who were like that Raskghar is to you. They are very sad. Are you sorry for doing it?”
The Raskghar pondered this. She sat there. And Erin tried to persuade her to tell the truth. Her aura was almost nonexistent outside of her inn. But look at me [Crowd Control]. Whatever she had—
Tell me. Show me there’s something. At last, Asoma looked at Erin directly.
“Why? Why am I sorry?”
Erin sat back. A mutter ran through the listening Watch.
“Because it was wrong. Because—it led to this. You being sick. Being hunted.”
She pointed at Asoma. The Raskghar slowly nodded. Erin whispered. Her throat felt tight.
“I won’t be angry. I just have to know. Now that you know all that—are you sorry?”
Asoma looked at her warily. So Erin Solstice smiled. It wasn’t even a good smile. But Asoma saw that and relaxed. She spoke.
“No.”

There was no redemption to be found there. Not in the Raskghar. Asoma had none in her. Perhaps—perhaps she didn’t know it was wrong.
Or maybe there really wasn’t anything in her. Erin had to stand next to a wall and inhale the smell of an alleyway for nearly ten minutes after leaving that cell.
No wonder Calruz had gone mad. Look at them. Perhaps the children—but the Raskghar boy, if it had been a boy, hadn’t even seemed like he understood Erin at all.
Kill them all? Erin wasn’t there. But it was more like the issue of killing a bunch of…wild dogs. She hated the Raskghar. And she saw little there to uncover.
Even so—had Zevara spoken to them? Looked into their very souls and seen the smiling Raskghar who would have eaten Gnoll’s hearts all over again? Surely she had. And still, she looked at the law and the law was clear.
But Erin’s heart was not. And it was her heart she was guided by. She had fought for Goblins. Because she could look at Numbtongue’s face and see in the crimson eyes tears. She could remember a Goblin smiling as she held his hand and he died.
There was nothing for the Raskghar. So what did she do?
“Miss Solstice? Are you alright?”
One of the [Guards] followed Erin outside. She’d practically run from the cell after a few more minutes. He offered her a handkerchief.
“Huh?”
Erin looked at him. He gestured to her.
“You’re crying.”
She was. Not for the Raskghar. Just for the bitterness of it all. Her friends—who got tarnished by the same brush as the Raskghar. Erin wiped at her eyes.
“I’m sorry. It’s horrible in there. I—the Raskghar aren’t like Goblins or Antinium.”
The Drake shook his head as he took the handkerchief back.
“No they are not, Miss. But orders are orders. Law’s the law, am I right?”
