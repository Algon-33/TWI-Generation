Tyrion Veltras stared at the place the [Assassin] had indicated. His hand drummed on the table. He looked at the [Assassin]. At the spot.
“When?”
“By midday, perhaps a bit later. Then—”
Tyrion Veltras drew his sword. He strode past the [Assassin] and roared one word.
“Jericha!”
She came running. But she was too slow; the [Lord] was racing out of the stables before the [Assassin]’s body collapsed. His head lay on the floor. Tyrion Veltras left Jericha and the frantic soldiers behind. He rode faster—faster—
 
—-
 
Now.
“What is he doing? That—that fool! That idiot!”
Ieka screamed at the scrying orb. She wasn’t the only one. The watchers of the noble houses saw the [Lord] of House Veltras strike at the [Trapmaster], scoring a deep slash before whirling. He rode down on the other three surprised [Assassins].
The [Blademaster] was alive—but he’d been gored through the stomach and thanks to the poison, the healing potion wasn’t working properly. He was screaming as Tyrion struck with his lance, breaking up the three around Ressa.
But what was he doing? She heard an [Assassin] speaking.
 
—-
 
“Leave. Or we will kill you.”
There were five. The [Lord] of Veltras stared at the wounded [Blademaster]; but the [Assassin] had stopped the bleeding with a Skill. He was crouching behind the others.
But all five were standing there. They hadn’t fled. They had not been prepared for him.
[Messages] were screaming towards the [Lord], but he could not hear them. Nor did he respond to the [Trapmaster].
“Keep them off me.”
He looked at Ressa. She blinked up at him, and then bared her teeth.
“[Pure Acceleration]. [Shadow Doppelganger]. [Whirlwind of Blades]!”
She leapt at them and the [Assassins] dove away with a cry as a second, shadow-Ressa appeared and was skewered on the [Blademaster]’s sword. Tyrion Veltras accelerated.
He had taught Hethon how to strike with a lance. The world became a single charge. And at the end of his lance tip—trying to evade—
“No!”
Mire had consumed dozens of potions. The [Trapmaster], Sithorn, threw a desperate loop of wire. Tyrion knocked it away with his shield.
“[Lancing Hydrastrike].”
He stabbed Mire with his lance at the same time as his first strike hit her in the shoulder. Off-target.
She lost her arm and shoulder. The [Lord] saw her fall, grabbing at a healing potion. She healed herself; he frowned. But her arm was gone.
“Call him off or give us a second target.”
Sithorn hissed into a speaking stone. He listened, then bellowed at Tyrion as Mire backed up, muffling her howl of pain.
“Lord of House Veltras. Why are you helping a traitor to Izril?”
Not his words. But if they worked—Lord Tyrion lifted his lance. He charged again, wordlessly.
This time he was foiled—the [Thrower] snarled.
“[Full Power Throw]! [Hail of Projectiles]!”
She threw nearly thirty enchanted darts which exploded and forced the [Lord] to evade and block. He rode out of the cloud of dust, unharmed. He slapped a vial of healing potion onto his wounded mount as he rode, lance raised.
As if he was on the tilting grounds. The [Lord] calmly spoke as the [Assassins] pivoted towards him. Magnolia was kneeling besides Reynold, empty bottles in her hands. The [Lord] looked up and addressed the invisible watchers.
“I am not Magnolia Reinhart’s ally. I do not agree with her. I detest how she rules her lands and her philosophy is antithetical to mine. If she comes against me, I will oppose her, even if it should mean one of our deaths. However.”
He lowered the lance. Magnolia looked up at him and Tyrion gave her a cold look. Then he nodded.
