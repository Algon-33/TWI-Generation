“Well, I’ve had it up to here with you, Grimalkin. This ain’t Pallass. But guess what? This is my inn. And if you don’t want to respect my guests—you’re not welcome here. So guess what again? Get out.”
She pointed towards the door. Ryoka’s jaw dropped. So did Grimalkin’s.
“You can’t be serious.”
“Totally am. Get out. Go back to Pallass. And that’s another thing. Pallass is going to let Liscor decide about the Raskghar or…”
“Or what?”
The [Sinew Magus] loomed. Erin looked up at him. And that was Grimalkin’s second mistake. Erin wasn’t afraid of him. It was incredible, really. But she wasn’t. Even someone who was ‘not afraid’ of Grimalkin would stare at that amount of muscle and ‘not be nervous’. But Erin?
“You listening, Grimalkin? I said—get out of my inn.”
She put her foot down. And Grimalkin staggered. Ryoka saw his feet move—he took two steps and swung back.
“You can’t kick me out of your inn, Miss Solstice. I believe if there’s debts to be counted—”
The [Innkeeper] turned. The ambient noise in the inn was dying down. Everyone was taking notice.
“Yeah, you’ve helped a lot, Grimalkin. Saved my life, punched Beza over there—but you know what? You can be kind of a jerk. And I’ve kicked out friends before. Actual friends. I said—get out.”
This time Ryoka felt the push as if it were the air. She saw Grimalkin walk back a few steps. Then brace. Whatever was happening, he was fighting it.
“You. Are not in a position to stop me. Aura manipulation can be broken.”
He clenched one fist. Ryoka tensed and saw the duo with the hats slowly slide back behind Grimalkin. His eyes flicked sideways and he went still. But Erin waved at Wilovan and Ratici. She strode up to Grimalkin.
“Erin—”
She ignored Palt. Erin prodded Grimalkin in the chest again.
“Oh yeah, I bet that’s true. You could smack me, Grimalkin. So go ahead and do it. Hit me. Because you’re right. You can do whatever you want in this inn by force. Funny thing though. The thing about punching people is they remember. So. Do you want to threaten me again, Grimalkin of Pallass?”
“I wouldn’t, sir. Fair bit of warning. It seems quite ungentlemanly. And unless I’m completely in the wrong, you seem to have overstayed your welcome.”
Wilovan smiled brightly at Grimalkin. The Sinew Magus looked around. And he caught on too late.
“Miss Erin. Consider that Pallass is—”
“Walk back to your city, Grimalkin.”
And he did. Slowly, the [Sinew Magus] turned. He could have punched Erin or used a spell. But she was right. The threat of violence only worked if the other side was afraid it’d happen. And Erin? Grimalkin had two Gentlemen Callers, at least four Wistram [Mages], a Hobgoblin with a sword, and an angry Mrsha who’d all jump on him if he so much as tried.
“So you’ll just throw me out? Is that it?”
The Drake spoke one last time as Erin opened the door and he walked through. He faced her from the other side. Erin gave him a sad look.
“Grimalkin. You’re welcome to come back if you change. I like you. But you’re not a good guest. And guess what?”
“What?”
“You can’t threaten me with Pallass. Because Pallass? I don’t need it. It’s nice. But it’s not essential. And you? You’re no Zel Shivertail. He was better than you.”
Ryoka winced. And she thought Lyonette—Grimalkin just stared at Erin, poleaxed for once, until she called past him.
“Hey Kel! Guards! Tell Chaldion I want a word. In my inn, now. Please and thank you!”
The guards at the checkpoint stared at Erin.
“You can’t just order—”
That old refrain. Erin cut it down as she shouted.
