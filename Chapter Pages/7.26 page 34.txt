Lyonette saw the young man turn, run, and intercept the ball with his chest. It bounced off, he caught the ball on one foot, and lobbed it back.
“Nice kick!”
Ekirra’s tiny mouth gaped open. So did Lyonette’s. That was so—natural. And Joseph had done it? But he was grinning.
“Hey, how’d you do that?”
Drassi protested weakly. Joseph saw another ball coming his way. He blocked it with a leg, gave it a kick back—so Ekirra had to chase after it, laughing. He grinned.
“Pass me Ekirra’s ball?”
Drassi tossed it at him. Joseph rolled it onto one foot, kicked it up. He gently kicked the ball as it came down, kicked it up, juggling it.
“I played all the time back home. There’s a game that uses a ball just like this. See?”
He kicked the ball back into Drassi’s claws. The Drake nearly fumbled the catch. Ekirra blasted the ball at Joseph. He had to shoulder-block it with a grunt before it hit Lyonette.
“Not so hard! Control! Let’s play!”
“How?”
“Well—we’ll go towards a goal. Let’s make one.”
The Gnoll’s ears perked up. He stared as Joseph outlined a goal against the wall.
“You shoot here, see? And I’ll block. I can use my hands if I’m a goalkeeper.”
“Okay. I shoot! Aha!”
The little Gnoll kicked. The ball soared—and Joseph dove. He blocked the ball as if his life depended on it. Ekirra saw the ball flying and ran after it.
“Nice try!”
The Spanish young man was grinning as he got up. He blocked a shot coming at the goal with his foot, booted the ball back across the field. Now Ekirra was barking with delight.
“That looks like fun. Can I try?”
Drassi perked up. She hurried over and Ekirra passed her the ball. Drassi gave a wild, but terribly inaccurate kick. The round ball bounced off one of Celum’s walls. And the sproingy sound it made—
From inside the inn, Ishkr’s ears twitched. A few Gnolls looked about.
There was a logic to it. Drassi swore as she rubbed at her feet. Joseph worriedly checked the ball.
“No claws! You’ll burst the ball. Use the inside of your foot, like this. See? You want control.”
He demonstrated to his audience. Ekirra passed the ball back. Drassi missed the ball and gave up.
“I’m not good at this game. I’ll go back to the inn and work if that’s okay.”
“Can I…trade places?”
A voice made Lyonette turn. Ishkr was watching. His tail was wagging ever so slightly. His eyes were fixed on the moving ball.
Baseball, now, baseball had a ball. And catching and throwing and hitting the ball. So of course Gnolls loved it. But Drakes loved the idea of stealing bases and controlling territory just as much. This game had…chasing.
“Sure. If that’s okay, Lyonette?”
Joseph looked at the [Princess]. She nodded to Ishkr, who never asked for breaks unless he really needed them, unlike Drassi.
“Go ahead, Ishkr. Take an hour’s break.”
“I never get an hour’s break.”
Drassi grumbled. Lyonette rolled her eyes. But she saw Ishkr take off his apron and hurry outside. Then there were three.
“There are two goals. And you try to score. You can’t go outside the lines. We don’t have a field, so let’s just play. Try to score a goal.”
“A goal! I want to kick!”
“Try passing it. So I can’t tell where it’s coming from.”
Joseph saw Ishkr pass to Ekirra, and then saw the wild kick. He was too slow to dive—but the ball missed the goal. Ekirra ran after the ball.
And there was that sound again. Leather hitting stone. More people turned.
“I’m going to kick it back! Look how far!”
The little Gnoll was having fun. Joseph shouted as Ekirra booted the ball back.
“Go back! I’ll kick it to you. You think this is far? Back! Further back!”
