Lyfelt had made this a public relations opportunity. The [Soldiers] saw dates, fresh fruit like the oranges everyone knew that the royal family loved so much, being placed on the table by [Servants]. They crowded around before the [Captain] tried to restore order.
“No, please, let them eat. I only wonder if I could speak to some of your people, [Captain]? Afterwards?”
He was all too willing to agree, and while many helped themselves, Jecaina found herself looking at nearly two thousand survivors of the battered group. And they were almost entirely intact…
Only about two dozen of them retired with oranges and glasses of grape juice in hand—plucked from vineyards rather than made into wine to support the war effort—in a more private setting. Jecaina found herself face to face with Fetohep’s veterans.
“[Horse Archers].”
The [Lieutenant of the Bow] bowed deeply.
“Yes, your Majesty. We got out of the last battle mainly intact.”
“And you haven’t taken nearly as many casualties as any other group in the war.”
The [Mounted Archers], [Rider]-[Archer] composites, some of whom had been one or the other but were gaining levels in both, bowed their heads. They looked guilty.
“No, your Majesty. The truth is…”
It was plain tactics. [Horse Archers] didn’t take casualties nearly as much as [Lancers], [Trick Riders], who raced into the fore of battle. They retreated from half-Giants, shot arrows on the flanks—their only real danger was an enemy cavalry charge or other [Archers].
“We’re ashamed to admit it, but we’ve let our brothers and sisters die while we shoot from afar.”
The [Lieutenant]’s cheeks were red. Here, at least, Jecaina could do something. She thought of what Lyfelt might say, and changed it to be actually genuine. She put a hand out and touched his shoulder.
“Lieutenant, you fulfilled your role in battle. If others fell before you—you will have to fight all the harder for the living and the dead. I think Jecrass has need of your bows, so I am grateful you are all alive. I would rather not one more [Soldier] died, so don’t regret it. Please.”
“Thank you, your Majesty.”
He bowed again. And Jecaina looked at the group of [Horse Archers], all of whom wanted to thank her for coming. And she knew what to do.

Lael came to see her personally two days later. She expressed her concerns bluntly; the war had worn down any niceties she used to employ at court.
“Your Majesty, you’ve disassembled every mounted archer group in all of my forces and replaced them with new [Archers]. Am I to understand this new battle group will be under your direct command?”
“Not mine, Lael. Yours. But it will be this.”
“A mounted archery group?”
It was Jecaina’s idea. Strategist Meroon had made it more possible. Centaurs knew this kind of fighting.
“It’s hardly a new idea. The—Maelstrom’s Howling company in Baleros is famous for this kind of fighting force. They’ll harry our enemies. Loose arrows, flee. I intend to make them a Unit if I gain a Skill. Or if you do.”
“Begging your Majesty’s pardon. But we have [Trick Riders]—”
“Not anymore, Lael. We need a strong, veteran force and all of our old groups are worn away. They are high-level—higher level than any of the other soldiers by an average of six levels. Meroon has ideas…”
It was simple. Make up smaller groups, each led by someone with fast movement Skills. They would then shoot and run, and harry anyone but the [Steward].
Change the strategy of the war. Lael sighed.
