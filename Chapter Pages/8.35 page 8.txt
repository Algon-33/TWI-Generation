“That…that is not the name of any Wyrm I know. That…what strange magic is this? You have no classes. No levels. Are you a throwback? Some strange…?”
He twisted around her, staring. Ryoka was still naked and deeply resented that fact.
“Put me down. I did not lie. You know I didn’t lie. And—give me back my clothes!”
“It has to be a lie. If it’s not…? This is that she-Wyvern’s doing. Only she would be this cruel. The other two might be arrogant lizards, but they could not be this evil. I thought they were all dead. Or at least…”
He ignored her. Ryoka got angrier. Rhisveri murmured and her skin constricted again, but not with physical pressure; more like someone wrapping cling-wrap around her, invisible, powerful.
“Tell me the truth.”
“I met her. Sikeri! A Wyrm! And three more!”
“How is this thing lying?”
Rhisveri stared through Ryoka. He flipped her upside down and shook her repeatedly, as if to shake out some secret relic. Ryoka lost her temper twice.
“I—am Ryoka—will—down—”
She nearly threw up. The shaking didn’t stop and then Rhisveri was drawing closer. He sniffed her and it happened again. Ryoka couldn’t speak for being rattled around. But the wind roared in her voice.
“In the name of the Faerie King, put me down!”
Rhisveri froze. He tilted Ryoka up. Her clothes didn’t reappear. Nor did she float downwards. The Wyrm eyed Ryoka, then spoke.
“Is that what they’re styling themselves as, now? That’s a stupid name.”
Then he went back to inspecting her from all angles, rotating her for a better view like someone inspecting a toy.
Ryoka was so thrown by the lack of comprehension she was stunned. Right up until her legs spread apart.
“You bastard!”
“Relax, thing. There is absolutely nothing I could be interested in.”
Rhisveri replied absently. He frowned.
“Do I have to cut you in half? Did they write the spell on your bones?”
The Wind Runner’s eyes snapped open. Her blood was boiling. It was one thing to insult her, to stare at her, to strip her naked…no, actually, that was everything wrong.
But also, the Faerie King? He didn’t know? He didn’t…? She howled the name.
“By the will of the King of the Fae, put me down! By his name! Oberon!”
This time, she fell out of the air. Rhisveri caught her with magic a second later, but she saw his entire body twitch. He stared at her, and then around.
“What was that name? That’s not the name of a Treant. That’s…don’t say that name again, you wretched Human! How…? The gateway folk?”
Then his eyes went round. Ryoka was satisfied. She pointed a trembling hand at him.
“Give me my clothes. Put me down. Speak to me, Wyrm, by his name! Oberon!”
“Stop saying it!”
He looked around, nervously. Ryoka said it.
“Oberon. Oberon! OBERON!”
The air shook. Rhisveri flinched. Ryoka hit the ground, clothed, as the Wyrm reared back, his eyes flashing. In a defensive stance. The air hummed as he and Ryoka waited. The wind went still.
…But no one came.
Rhisveri relaxed, slowly, and almost smiled. Almost. But he couldn’t deny the power in the name. Ryoka stood there, breathing slowly. She looked up at Rhisveri.
“I am Ryoka Griffin. Friend of the fae! Friend of the other world, and the name even you must respect, Wyrm. I have met your kind. I have met Sikeri’val-Toreshio-Maresssui. I did not mean to steal from you, and I came here to make peace. Will you listen to me?”
She spread her arms wide as Sammial stirred. The boy twitched, and Rhisveri looked at him. The Wyrm slowly bent lower, and he looked at her.
