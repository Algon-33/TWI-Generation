Mavika hissed at Eloise. The [Tea Witch] paused, then nodded.
“I require a gift. Witch Rebeca.”
“I will break the [Assassin]’s hold, Witch Eloise. Give me your brew.”
The audience watched, spellbound as the pot changed hands. The second [Witch] murmured. And Laken was beginning to understand. He leaned forwards, and even Durene forgot her nerves—
“And we can see, young [Witches], how each [Witch] is performing the divination using a combination of Skills! Witch Oliyaya is using her [Prediction of Success] Skill in combination with Witch Eloise’s herb craft.”
Witch Agratha clapped her hands together as she decided to take this moment to lecture the audience. Half of the [Witches] sitting there turned and gave her dark looks.
Rather like someone who decided to explain every trick as a stage magician performed it, Agratha went on as Witch Oliyaya glowered at her.
“You see, Witch Oliyaya can only use her Skill so many times, but I will be using [Renew Skill]—a very useful Skill if put in conjunction with other Skills. This way, Witch Eloise will be able to test out numerous brews and see how effective they are. We are isolating the poison by the cure—”
“Witch Agratha. The ritual is ongoing.”
Mavika hissed at her. The [Witch]-[Teacher] hesitated. She made a sound of discontent.
“Ah…yes, Witch Mavika. I just thought it was ideal to teach in the moment. We’ll review this later!”
She beamed at her pupils. Laken was informed by Durene that the other [Witches] were rolling their eyes at this point.
“Different kinds of craft, I suppose.”
He saw why Eloise wasn’t a fan of Agratha. And also—why Agratha had not been invited to the same gathering as Belavierr. Totally different style. Also—Laken wondered what Belavierr would have done if Agratha had decided to explain her magic.
He wondered if Agratha could.
“Ah. Skillbreaking works. But—there’s some magic in it! The cure needs more. More! The children have a fly’s chance caught by deadly web, but it grows!”
“Would you say that’s a one-in-ten chance, or one in a hundred still?”
Agratha got another dirty look from Oliyaya and the others. The [Witches] murmured. Eloise looked around.
“I have none of the rarest materials. Witch Devay? I seek your aid.”
“I have seen some of what you seek, Witch Eloise. What do you wish?”
“Mithril dust. And—have you witnessed Darcaw’s Pearl?”
“No, Witch Eloise.”
“Then—”
Laken saw through Durene, a phantom substance appearing in Devay’s empty bowl. This was where the magic began working with Skill. The other [Witches] had to help Devay.
“A half-cure for a half-sickness. We must account for that.”
Another [Witch] murmured. And Laken got it again, before Agratha whispered her explanations. The [Witches] were supplementing any lack of Eloise’s ingredients.
On it went. After the third pass, Oliyaya had to take a break. Another [Witch] took over from her. Not with the same Skill—she used another Skill as Eloise did. [Tea Omens] provided more enigmatic answers than Oliyaya, who was using Mavika’s proximity to the children to ascertain the odds of success.
Oliyaya wouldn’t have been able to divine at the range without a physical link with Mavika, who could share Skills with her raven. And the [Tea Omens] Skill could be vague. The other [Witches] began producing their own means of divination. Frustratingly, Agratha’s medium was a clacking abacus.
But it was Eloise who worked. And her knowledge of herbs craft and—Laken realized—poison was what was leading her to identify the increasingly narrow set of poisons that could produce the effects in Hethon and Sammial.
