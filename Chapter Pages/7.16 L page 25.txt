Like a dream. You couldn’t believe what you were seeing. One part of you told you what was happening, and the rest wanted to deny.
“Pawn.”
Erin was moving. But she was moving in slow motion. She saw the world slow. Her [Inn’s Aura]—she tried to grab it. But then she just ran.
Nothing would stop him.
Klbkch was halfway there. Someone stood. Chesacre. She had been sitting next to Thaina. She slowly put one of her three remaining arms out. Blocking Klbkch.
His sword moved. Chesacre’s arm fell to the ground. The Antinium stared at the green blood, her arm. Erin cried out.
Thaina stood. Chesacre looked at Thaina and at Pawn as Klbkch halted. The Soldier paused for a moment.
And then she walked in front of Klbkch. Nothing more. She did not raise her two remaining arms on her right side. She just waited.
The silver sword swung.
“Klbkch.”
Pawn spoke. The Revalantor ignored him. He traced an arc through the air. Pawn raised a hand.
“Erin kiiiiick!”
The [Innkeeper] smashed into Klbkch’s side. He moved a tiny bit. She bounced off and fell down. He was like a statue in more ways than one. The Revalantor looked at Erin.
“Pawn, get behind me.”
Lyonette pushed Pawn back. The [Priest] reached for her. Erin scrambled to her feet,
“Get into the Garden! Now!”
She pointed at Chesacre. The Soldier stared at her. It was Thaina who grabbed her partner and hurried her to the door.
“Inside!”
Erin was on her feet. She blocked Klbkch, holding her arms out. The Antinium moved in a rush. Klbkch stared at Erin.
“Move.”
His voice was so cold. Erin refused. But she was afraid. The Antinium was staring at her. And there was not a hint of familiarity in his eyes. She felt-saw his blade next to her head. If it moved—
She felt cut by the gaze as much as the blade. Klbkch walked around her. Erin tried to move with him. He put a hand on her shoulder and shoved her aside.
“Pawn.”
Lyonette was pushing him towards the door. The Antinium stepped through, the last to go. They were standing just at the barrier to the Garden and inn. Staring at Klbkch.
“You.”
Klbkch extended his arm. The tip of his blade drifted towards Pawn’s head. It stopped—in the invisible barrier in the air between inn and garden. Klbkch paused, and pushed.
Erin felt something…pushing. In her head. She knew it wouldn’t go through. But he was putting force behind it. Klbkch looked at Pawn, lowered his sword. Pawn opened his mandibles.
“Klbkch. I realize I am disobeying. This was my decision. But—this is necessary. I have leveled up. I have a new Skill. The value—”
“You disobeyed my orders.”
Klbkch’s voice was flat. He looked at Pawn. Erin looked down at the blood. Chesacre’s arm. She looked at Klbkch. No.
Who was that? The Antinium turned his head, looking at the other Antinium. Pawn replied, slowly.
“They were the wrong orders, Klbkch.”
“They were my orders. You. Disobeyed.”
Pawn spread his hands. The [Priest] paused, looking around.
“I am Individual. I disobeyed orders to become myself. This is what you wanted.”
The Antinium looked at him. Slowly, he shook his head.
“No. I see now. I was in error. You are not necessary. You are not what the Hive needs. You are Aberration. All of you.”
He looked around. The Antinium on the other side of the door shuddered. Pawn stared.
“You—cannot call us that.”
“You are mistakes.”
Klbkch looked at Anand. The Worker who wanted to call him ‘father’. Anand shook. Pawn reached out, as if to put his hand through the door. He hesitated.
