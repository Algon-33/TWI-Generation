“Hah! Is that what you seek, Human? Why didn’t you say so? We can find your dead-raiser far more easily than that bauble!”
 
Both Urksh and Ryoka looked up. One of the faeries flew down and gave Ryoka a pointy-toothed smile.
 
“We can sense where the dead gather. If you wish, we will take you to the one you seek.”
 
Ryoka looked suspicious, but then her expression changed. She nodded.
“If you know where to go. I’ll accept.”
Something tugged at her shirt. Ryoka looked down. It was Mrsha. The young Gnoll child was tugging at Ryoka’s shirt, insistently. She looked heartbroken. Ryoka hesitated, and then turned and bent. She patted Mrsha on the head, like a kid, ruffling her hair. The Gnoll girl shied away, but looked imploringly at Ryoka nonetheless.
“I’ve got to go.”
Ryoka turned, and—had the Frost Faeries been smiling? It was just a flash, but she could have sworn they’d been smiling at Mrsha. But as Ryoka turned towards them they were wearing their customary looks of mischief or contempt. But that was just an act too, wasn’t it?
 
“Come on slow Human! We go west now, west towards death! You will tell us many stories as we travel, won’t you?”
 
“Maybe.”
The faeries scowled. One flipped backwards in the air.
 
“Bah! ‘Tis just another way of saying ‘never’!”
 
“I’ll tell you stories if you don’t bother me, but only after we stop. Deal?”
 
“Maybe.”
 
Ryoka rolled her eyes, but then it was really time to go. Mrsha clung to her leg, but at last Ryoka prised her loose. The young woman turned and waved towards the Gnolls, and set out. It was a clear, blue day and the winter air was crisp and fresh.
She smiled, and waved one last time as the distant figures and tents disappeared from sight. For once, Ryoka wasn’t running from something but to something. And she was following faeries.
Ryoka’s good spirits lasted for fifteen minutes as she ran through the snow. Then a snowball dropped onto her face and she heard a voice in her ear.
 
“Oops!”
