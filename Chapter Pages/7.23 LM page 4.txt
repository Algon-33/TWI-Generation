They were training their auras. Or at least, Erin had asked Lyonette to practice after being beaten by Magnolia. The problem was…she was going about it all wrong. Lyonette panted at the [Innkeeper] as more people began coming downstairs, like a dressed Hexel—which meant clothes over his upper half and midriff—nothing around his gleaming tail.
“I told you, Erin. That’s not how Auras work. You’re using yours like a hammer.”
“Yeah. And I nearly smacked you.”
Erin exhaled a few times before putting a fried egg on toast and biting into it.
“But you didn’t. And you never would have gotten me to budge. Let alone Magnolia. Didn’t you feel what I was doing?”
The young woman frowned. She looked at Lyonette and recalled the feeling.
“Yeah. You bunched up. Like…a rock. I couldn’t shift you.”
“I consolidated my aura. You were using yours like a hammer. It was too wide, Erin. And few auras can make someone just—move. You could keep me out a lot easier than force me to leave. One’s a shield, the other is—hard.”
Lyonette looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] was frowning, trying to understand.
“…I don’t quite get it. Explain it again?”
The [Princess] exhaled.
“I told you, I never took many aura-lessons. My mother didn’t think it was time yet—I was a Level 5—you-know-what. But this is what she taught me. Erin, you’re unskilled. I’m better at using my aura. You have high potency—no manifestation or control.”
The [innkeeper] blinked a few times.
“I have what the what the what?”
The [Princess] rubbed at her head. She had a headache, despite being able to resist someone twenty levels higher than she was.
“Potency. The power of your aura in your inn is strong. As strong as Magnolia’s maybe. But your control—how you use it—is weak. Magnolia could refine her aura until she could actually push you out of the way, or hold everyone down. Erin—is like a giant blanket. She affects everything. She doesn’t focus on one person.”
She nodded to the room as a whole. Mrsha and Numbtongue nodded.
“Too wide.”
The [Bard] summarized for Lyonette. Erin’s eyes widened.
“Oh.”
Lyonette sighed.
“Yes. ‘Too wide’. But you could fix that, Erin. You just need to practice. Focus on me; you were doing it near the end.”
“But why didn’t I move you if I had more power? I shoulda thrown you out, like bam!”
Erin punched her palm. Mrsha copied her, nodding. Lyonette looked at both of them.
“That’s not how auras work, Erin. It’s not—arm wrestling.”
“It’s not?”
“No! Why would it be? Erin, auras mix and match. Some win over others. It’s…complex. And I’m not an expert. What I do know is that you have potency, no control, and no manifestation.”
“What’s the manifestation bit?”
“You can’t make a sword out of your aura and cut someone in half with it.”
Numbtongue looked up from his food. So did Mrsha, her eyes shining.
“You can do that?”
Erin blinked. Lyonette nodded casually.
“Of course. But you need a specific aura. [Knights] have more…combat focused ones. Like a Thronebearer [Knight] from Calanfer. They can concentrate their auras, coat their blades in magical light to attack Ghosts. But that’s because their auras are tied to light and such. Yours? You have an [Inn’s Aura]. Hard to manifest that.”
“Oh. Well—can I try?”
“If you want to—”
Erin raised her hand.
“[Aura Sword]! Hiyah!”
She brought it down. Lyonette recoiled. So did Numbtongue. Mrsha stared hopefully at the table. Erin stared at the uncut butter in front of them.
“Aw.”
“Don’t do that!”
Lyonette shouted at Erin. The young woman sighed.
“I need more practice.”
