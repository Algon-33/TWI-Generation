The warrior kept shouting ‘die’ for nearly a minute. It was so loud, so wrathful, that some of Noelictus’ [Hunters] began checking to see if it was a curse spell or something.
“Dead gods, what is that? One of Khelt’s champions? It’s a Revenant. I didn’t know they had more than one.”
The [General of Bows] whispered. The Herald didn’t answer. No sooner had Salui calmed then someone else’s voice echoed from the battlefield.
“Pitiful mortals. You have gained the wrath of the Vizir Hecrelunn. In the name of Khelta, you shall perish. Unless you agree to serve Khelt, in which case you shall be spared as [Slaves]. It is an offer made once. The Vizir knows no mercy.”
“Treants.”
Someone whispered. The half-Elf [Mage] looked up. A shape was descending out of the sky.
A cloud had appeared overhead. The Herald of Forests looked up into unexpected shade on the burning day. It was unwelcome. She stared up at the Revenant’s face, copied across the clouds. Two vast pinpoints of crimson light stared down at her.
“Aha. Ahaha. A half-Elf [Mage]? Then I shall have a challenge at least. Great Salui. Destroy.”
It was all the warrior had been waiting for. He lifted the axe, stopped his shaking, and pointed.
“That one! THAT OOOOONEEEEE!”
He began running, axe raised, screaming and slashing the earth. Across the huge divide, without even waiting for Khelt’s army to move.
Straight at the Herald of Forests and the Fables. The [Vizir] had also singled out the half-Elf [Mage] among their ranks. He pointed.
“I am told you know water, little [Mage]. Catch. [Meteor Shower].”
“Elves guide us!”
The [General of Bows] screamed as the first glowing comets fell out of the sky. The [Mage] lifted his hands and barriers of water formed desperately.
“Who are these undead?”
High King Perric was screaming as the [Champion of War] ran into a firestorm of arrows and spells, screaming towards the Herald of Forests without slowing. The [Knights] were already charging as Khelt’s own army advanced.
“Cut through their lines! Archers, bring down that thing in the sky! We will break off to take care of that Revenant with the axe—”
The [Knight-Commander] was furiously shouting orders. She couldn’t help but remember what Queen Yisame had said about [Knights] and Dragons. But they had to fight! They had to—
The first rank of half-Giants was marching towards the [Knights]. They looked…better armored than the rest. A bit more sure, a bit too fast. The [Knights] in front lowered their lances, their instincts telling them to be wary, yet they came on in a charge.
“Foes to front! Use your best Skills now!”
One of the [Knights] bellowed. Forewarned, the [Knights] began activating their Skills. They saw the half-Giants slow.
Twenty of them. One of the half-Giants stopped pretending to be a mindless undead. He looked up, sighed, and adjusted his helmet.
“What a pity. Oh, brave little Humans. You match the tall with courage and Skill at times and bring us down. This we know. But…”
The [Knight-Commander]’s head whipped around just in time to see the flames glow in the half-Giant’s sockets as he finished his sentence.
“…only if you outlevel us. You have grown too small. Do you know my Skill?”
He strode forwards as the others put up their shields. The [Knights] craned their necks up as the thirty-foot half-Giant strode at them. Fast. Faster, running. Unlike all the other half-Giants. His mouth moved. His armored body left the ground.
“[Like a Lion, He Leapt].”
They choked as he flew. Every mortal on the ground stared up as the half-Giant drew his weapons. They heard his voice from above.
