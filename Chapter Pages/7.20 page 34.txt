Maviola El had been happy, a minute ago. Living, breathing, rejoicing in her youth. But happiness becomes sadness in a moment. Darkness engulfed her heart, moving at the edges of her vision.
“It’s so…different. What was I going to do? There’s no one alive. Only…”
She began to count on shaking fingers. Less than ten. Less than ten, enemies and friends. Maviola looked around, and had to rest her hands on her legs. She stopped, by the side of the street, as people glanced at her.
A beautiful young lady. Maviola looked around. There was so much she could do.
Find love, drink, explore, run as fast as she dreamed. And yet—she suddenly felt it. Her age. It crept up on her, making her breath slower. Her heart faltered.
She was old. And it was more than a word you could throw off with a magic spell. And this place—this was all wrong.
She shouldn’t have come here. Because it just told Maviola her time was over. Her memory had faded away. Just like her.
The young woman sank to her knees. Something was wrong with her heart. It was beating too slowly. She touched her chest. She heard it thumping. And waited.
But the next beat was too late. Maviola lay with her back to a wall, breathing slower. She reached for something. Something to blaze for. But they were all gone.
And she would like to go too. She had made her peace. Why had she wanted another week? A day was enough.
This was enough. Maviola saw some people peering at her with concern. But the [Lady]’s gaze was fading.
“It’s all left me behind. When did that happen?”
“Excuse me? Miss. Are you alright?”
Lady Maviola saw a figure waving a hand at her, concerned. So young. They were all young, but for the half-Elves. And they went mad with age. It was so hard to be old. She sighed.
And on the street, a slow-rolling carriage halted. A door opened. And a voice tsked. The young man waving at Maviola turned. And the young lady, the old lady, heard a voice.
“You look unwell, Lady El. Are you quite alright?”
The voice was familiar. Maviola’s eyes moved. She blinked. Magnolia Reinhart was standing over her, smiling. Ressa stood behind her.
Maviola breathed. She knew Magnolia. But…she didn’t think to ask why Magnolia was here. Dreamily, she spoke.
“Magnolia? I feel silly, all of a sudden. I was so fired up. And now, I feel quite tired.”
“Indeed?”
Magnolia Reinhart gracefully sat on the ground. Maviola jerked her head. Her vision was…dark. And her heart. Fading, not because it was weak physically. But because her soul was.
“It’s all so…different. Good. But different. I saw an Antinium. An adventurer. Are they…no longer monsters? Everything’s changed.”
She looked at Magnolia. And the [Lady], not the girl Maviola remembered, smiled. At least the smile was the same. Mischievous, bold, and fearless.
“I know. And they are still our enemies, Maviola. There are just—new things happening. But the garden of Izril is infested with insects. And the guardians of Izril must prune them away. As we always do. That is the same.”
“Guardians?”
Maviola breathed. She raised her head and shook it.
“We’re not guardians. You are. A soldier, to fight the Goblin King. And the Antinium. Perhaps we need you. But we are caretakers, not guardians.”
“A small difference.”
“No. You don’t understand. Then—that Antinium—”
The young woman breathed again. Her heartbeat increased. She saw Magnolia Reinhart, looking at her. Ressa stood with Reynold, keeping the passersby back. And two [Ladies] gazed at Maviola from the carriage.
“I think I fell down. I felt so tired. And I do, despite the potion. Is it flawed?”
“I don’t believe so.”
