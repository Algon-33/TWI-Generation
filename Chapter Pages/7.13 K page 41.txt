Mars the Illusionist surged at him, ignoring the other [Soldiers] trying to slow her. The King of Jecrass turned. Flos saw him duck one flaming blow, and then the second set him and his horse on fire.
Both screamed. But Raelt kept riding, striking at Mars with his rapier. He ripped another potion from a [Soldier]’s hands and drank it, tossing the rest on his mount. It was only fire. The burns healed as Mars switched blades.
Her sword made of pale metal. It cut straight through a River Warden. Mars ran at Raelt. And half a dozen [Trick Riders] crashed into her.
“Now!”
Ropes flew from their saddles. They snagged Mars and began dragging her across the ground. The [Vanguard] twisted. She slashed the ropes in half, but she’d lost Raelt. And he was still charging.
“Enough of this. Orthenon, to me. We’ll break this army in half. Commander Ytol, form up a charge!”
Flos snapped. The [Death Commander] and the Rustängmarder formed the head of the vanguard. Raelt saw them as he shouted, rallying a tide of riders at his back.
The King of Destruction. Four half-Giants. Orthenon and the vanguard of both riders and infantry.
Death. Jecrass’ army faltered. Thousands of their forces lay dead already. And Mars the Illusionist joined the spear led by the King of Destruction. The army of Reim howled as they charged.
“Morale.”
Raelt whispered. They had to stand. They had to fight. Even if three of Jecrass’ died for one of Reim’s. Six. Ten.
He was at the head of his army as they pulled back, afraid. Raelt felt his skin chilling, his heart burning. The potions and magic were screaming in his veins, making him want to puke and faint. But he was their [King]. He had to say something.
“Morale!”
The King of Jecrass bellowed the word. No grand speech. All he could think was that stupid word. The army of Jecrass looked at their [King]. Most hadn’t even heard the word he spoke, but they answered him, shouting what he had surely said.
“JECRASS!”
Raelt charged. And they poured after him. Flos Reimarch paused as he saw Jecrass’ army pouring at him.
“Damn.”
Both armies hit each other. Raelt saw the Rustängmarder holding the ground as the riders of Jecrass crashed on them. Slaughtered. Mars and Orthenon cut the [Soldiers] coming at them like flies. But Jecrass’ armies didn’t stop. And slowly, the Rustängmarder were pushed back. Flos’ [Soldiers] cut down two of Jecrass’ [Soldiers]. But the third cut them down.
“Bring Raelt of Jecrass down.”
Ulyse snapped. The [Mages] took aim. Grand Mage Esiela closed her eyes, but she was linked.
Raelt saw the [Siege Fireball] coming. This time, he urged his horse forwards. He felt the fireball explode, searing heat—an impact—
 
[King Level 30!]
[Conditions Met: King → King of Challenges Class!]
[Class Consolidation: Duelist removed.]
[Skill – Army: Flicker Charge obtained!]
[Skill – Royal Arms obtained!]
[Sk—
 
Ulyse saw Raelt standing up. He was bleeding, burned. He should have been dead. But each time he rose—the [Mage] had seen it before. Raelt pointed as he mounted his horse again.
“[Flicker Charge].”
His army—flickered—just like the name. Ulyse saw a group of [Riders] charging at the Serpent Hunters vanish for a crucial millisecond. And then they appeared amid the elite warriors, avoiding the first line of blades, fighting.
“Your Majesty! The King of Jecrass is counter-leveling!”
Ulyse projected his voice across the battlefield. The King of Destruction turned. He saw Raelt, his blade glowing, leading another charge.
