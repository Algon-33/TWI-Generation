He saw the Drake bow her head. For a long time she sat there. Then she looked up. Her eyes shone with no magical light. Just a reflection, and water.
“Make it soon? I’m tired of waiting.”
She reached out. Chaldion looked at the claw as it took his. He closed his eye.
“I promise.”
 
Author’s Note: The end. I’m not sure about this chapter. Mainly because I went through a terrible time writing it.
…Me-wise. The chapter was probably fine since I got it done, but the first chapter after a break has always sucked. And I’m still recovering from something. I could have taken more time off, but the world sort of sucks too right now. I want to write.
Still, I’m not at what I’d call 100%. But I hope you enjoyed this chapter and I am back from the break! But wow. This took me about…10 hours? Wait, that’s normal. I guess I just need to get back into the rhythm!
Hope you enjoyed, really. And I have some art to showcase! Today’s artist is Zelanter, who has done The King of Challenges in an amazing scene! Also cute Horns of Hammerad art! But I’m showcasing the amazing picture for another one of Innworld’s heroes.
Find the rest of all the new art in Fanworks! Hope you enjoy and thanks for reading! See you next chapter. Which is like…in three days. Hm. Back to work!
