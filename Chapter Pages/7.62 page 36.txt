The Drakes halted, losing their momentum. Relief—too late. The [Priest]’s mandibles opened. Wide. Wider. Then—he screamed.
It was a shriek without end. Without pause. Without rest. Without a trace of words or coherent thought in it. So chilling the Drakes shuddered. And then—the other Antinium opened their mandibles.
They all screamed. They came across the ground. The [Armor Commander] had never heard a sound like this. It sounded of Rhir’s hells. It sounded—
“Hold the line. Hold—”
His voice was lost. The Antinium surged at him. The [Priest] raised his staff. As if the censer was a flail. And his voice—
He had cursed them. Screamed at them. With words alone. Words, insufficient for the depth of his rage.
“The world ends! Death! Death! DEATH!”
Belgrade was screaming next to Pawn. The [Priest] looked at the Drakes as the first wave of Painted Soldiers neared the glittering pike tips. His voice dipped. He drew upon his hatred. His grief. The madness of Erin’s death.
“[Summon Aberration].”
The world split. Something peered out of the air. The [Armor Commander] turned his head.
“What is—”
A screaming thing appeared. Forming out of—it looked like a Worker. But it tore into the [Mages] to his left. The [Armor Commander]’s sword quivered in his hands.
“What did—what did—”
The first rank of Painted Soldiers hit the Drakes as another Aberration appeared, throwing itself forwards without heed of death or pain. Screaming.
“Hold your ground!”
The [Sergeant] was braced. The pikes were ready to impale the Antinium! They’d done this in the Second Antinium War. He saw the Antinium Soldiers charge into the pikes—
Snap. The thick haft of one of the pikes cracked as it struck the largest Soldier with yellow on its body. Another Soldier was impaled. It charged down the length of the pike—grabbed the [Pikewoman] and bit her face off.
The first line of Drakes disappeared. The Antinium didn’t stop! The [Sergeant] and the [Lineholder]s brought up their weapons.
“[Perfect Block]!”
A Drake roared. He blocked a Soldier’s charge. The Soldier, painted with little stars on his armor, stumbled. The Drake lifted his blade with a roar.
“[Power Strike]!”
He swung—and the Soldier leaned around the blade. Blurring under it—the [Sergeant] stared as the [Shieldbearer]’s eyes widened.
A Sk—
The Soldier seized the Drake, grabbing both arms and wrenching them out. The Drake elite went down as the other two fists punched mercilessly. The Drake tried to move, fight back—the Soldier rose, red on his carapace.
Skills? The [Sergeant] whirled about. His sword rose—
[Flash Blade]! The light blinded the largest Soldier as it came at him. The [Sergeant] cut—
His blade dug in an inch into the other [Sergeant]’s armor and stopped. Yellow Splatters raised a fist. The Drake died. Yellow Splatter turned.
“Slaughter them all.”

Luldem’s lines broke. The [Mages] on the flanks were in retreat. Hectval’s army was falling back. But they weren’t done.
“Forwards! Forwards!”
Olesm heard Menolit and the other leaders shouting. He was looking past them.
Hectval’s [General]. Olesm saw the dead and wounded.
“He’s making his lines stronger. So long as he lives—”
Maviola, panting, slowed her horse next to him. She nodded.
“He will fall on us if we retreat. Drake pride.”
Hectval’s army had held despite the charge. Despite the casualties. Oh, each line had broken, but the ones behind had forced them to turn and fight. Groups were surrendering—
Olesm stared at the [General].
“I have a plan. 4th Company.”
“Sir?”
