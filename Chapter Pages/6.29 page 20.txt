Pawn jerked back. He stared at the Worker, who raised a tentative hand. He was holding a clipboard, which was really a nail board since the bit of parchment was held on place by a small nail.
“Hello, Individual Pawn. I am Bishop. Individual Anand has told me about you. I am—”
“That’s not Bishop.”
The Worker recoiled. Anand whirled.
“Pawn.”
Pawn was shaking. The Worker looked at the other two. His voice was trembling. Blooms of fury were rising in his chest.
“Bishop named himself in the battle for Liscor. He died there, Anand. That was his name. You should have known—no. That was his name. You have to take another.”
He looked at the fake Antinium. The Worker was trembling.
“I—I am sorry, Individual Pawn. This one didn’t know. This one—”
Anand put two arms out in front of Bishop.
“Enough. Pawn. I allowed him to take the name Bishop.”
“You allowed?”
Pawn looked at Anand, shocked. The [Tactician] nodded.
“Two Antinium may have the same name, Pawn. And Bishop would not have begrudged his name being used. He might even have liked it, if he had understood it.”
“But it was his name. If another Worker has it—”
Pawn couldn’t articulate the rest. How would they remember Bishop, the real Bishop? But Anand just shook his head.
“The name is both of theirs. And it will matter to both. What this Bishop becomes and the Bishop we knew—it is not one thing or the other. They are both Bishop. Pawn. He wanted that name. Look at him.”
He pointed to Bishop. The Worker was shuddering. Hunched, like Archer B23. Pawn instantly felt his anger subside. He reached out.
“I am sorry. I did not mean that. I am sorry. Bishop. Forgive me.”
“Forgive?”
The Worker looked up. Anand put a hand on his shoulder.
“Say yes, if you bear Pawn no ill will, Bishop. It is your decision. Your power. No one may force you to say yes.”
The Worker looked back at Anand. And the Workers in the room stared at Anand. Workers and Soldiers. The [Tactician] looked around. And Bishop stared at Pawn. He hesitated. And thought. And then he spoke.
“Yes. I bear you no ill will, Individual Pawn.”
“Thank you.”
Susurration. Pawn stood back. Anand let Bishop walk back to his peers. The two looked around, and at each other.
“We were still growing. We were barely Individual, then. Even you. Now we are truly Individual. But these are Autonomous Workers. Not like us. Bishop is the closest, I think, because I play chess with him and he helps me. But even he has a way to go. I am not sure about your Painted Soldiers, but I think all but Purple Smile and Yellow Splatters are closer to Autonomous than Individual.”
“That is the new metric? Did Klbkch come up with it?”
“Belgrade, actually. It helps differentiate them. And it makes sense.”
Pawn nodded slowly. He hesitated. Archer Group F arrived, walking into the room holding bows and arrows, both crude. But no less deadly.
“I confess, Anand. I did not understand the plight of the Workers until now. I was too focused on the Soldiers. I’ve ignored part of our Hive. Again.”
Anand shrugged. He leaned on a wall; the action was so spontaneous and natural that neither Worker noticed. But the other Workers and Soldiers stared; none of them would ever have done that. None had.
“You were busy with the Painted Soldiers, Pawn. You gave to them what the Workers could obtain with chess. You cannot be everywhere.”
“You’ve looked after these Workers, then. I thank you.”
Anand hesitated.
“To an extent. The ones in this room—excluding the Archer Groups—are mine. But the vast majority of the Workers I don’t interact with. This is my personal group. Belgrade has his.”
