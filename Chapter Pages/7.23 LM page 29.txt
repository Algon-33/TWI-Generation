“I—let’s duck under the shells. Maybe they have a weak point.”
Leon whispered. Troydel just looked at the Rock Crabs. He grinned, face white.
“I guess we find out if this is a game after all.”
Each to their own. The Rock Crabs paused. Imani’s screaming was bothering them. It was very loud. And there was a second sound below it. No—coming from the side? Their antennae turned. And then the screaming grew louder.
“You jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerks! Get off my lawn!”
Erin Solstice raced over a hill. The Earthers looked up. The young woman was alone.
“Erin! Fucking run!”
Joseph bellowed. Erin was unarmed. But she was holding a handful of—
Seed cores. Erin threw the first. It splatted on a Rock Crab’s shell. The giant crab recoiled as the deadly poison leaked down towards its antennae. It jerked back and the other Rock Crabs backed up.
“Get lost!”
Erin threw the other seed cores. The Rock Crabs scurried back as the young Humans looked up, gaping. The [Innkeeper] hurled another core and pointed.
“Run! This way!”
They looked at each other. Then they ran. Kevin and Joseph went back and grabbed the petrified Imani. Erin threw more seed cores.
“Yeah! Get lost! You stupid crabs! I’ve had it up to here with—uh oh.”
She realized she was out of seed cores. The Rock Crabs stopped scuttling away. They turned. Erin Solstice hesitated. They began scuttling at the poison-thrower, full of rage.
“What do we do?”
“Run!”
Erin pushed Leon towards the inn. She held her ground. Rose pulled at her. Erin shouted.
“I said, run for it!”
She backed up, covering the other’s retreat. You couldn’t outrun Rock Crabs on the hills and valleys. They were too fast. Erin raised a fist. She concentrated.
Aura. The first Rock Crab coming up the hill saw Erin staring down at it.
“Hey. Hey you. I’ll eat you. Get outta here.”
The [Innkeeper] pointed at the Rock Crab. The Hollowstone Deceiver hesitated. The aura was making Erin…feel dangerous. But Erin was tired. Outside her inn. Her aura flickered. The Rock Crab clicked one claw.
“Oh shit.”
Erin backed up. She turned to run. The Rock Crab went up the hill.
“Erin!”
Rose saw the [Innkeeper] leap down the hill. The Rock Crab scurried over the top. It raised a pincer to snap her in half. And an arrow shot from The Wandering Inn’s tower.
It flashed past Erin and hit the ground. The young woman saw it flashing towards the Rock Crab’s feet. A miss?
No—the arrow bounced off the ground as if it was rubber and went straight under the shell. The Rock Crab made a keening sound.
[Ricochet Arrow]. From his tower, Bird took aim. He shot another arrow and it curved and went through the Rock Crab’s exposed antennae. Blue blood ran onto the ground as Erin scrambled away. The Rock Crab withdrew into its shell as the other Rock Crabs scuttled past it.
“That is not good. The crabs will eat Miss Solstice. My arrows are not big enough.”
Bird spoke to himself as he saw Erin running. He casually shot another antennae out, and then looked at the inn.
“Alarm! Hello? There are Rock Crabs! I am Bird. AND I AM CALLING AN ALARM!”
The Workers on the roof of the inn looked up. They saw the distant Humans running. They began to click their mandibles. Then scream.
The piercing wail made the inn’s patrons halt. Grimalkin looked up as he demonstrated a proper deadlift. The Horns of Hammerad stopped arguing about how Ceria’s aura should be used. Halrac cursed.
The Rock Crabs, all six of them, raced after the Earthers. They were running for the inn. Erin brought up the rear. She hurled her knife through one of the Rock Crab’s antennae.
