“Half-Giant! Moore! I can reach the tower! But I need you to—throw me.”
Zenol’s bodyguards whirled. The [Prince] pointed at his personal [Mage]. The Cotton-caste woman looked horrified.
“Prince Zenol!”
“Do not argue! The scroll!”
Zenol was sweating now. He saw Moore raise his head.
“I can’t throw you that far.”
It was hundreds of feet. Zenol bared his teeth.
“I don’t need you to do it alone. Just give me a platform. Your strength and my Skill combined can do it. With this.”
The [Green Mage]’s objections were cut off as Zenol’s [Mage] produced one of his remaining scrolls. She opened it, looked uncertainly at him.
The [Prince of Sands] snatched it. He unfurled it and magic flashed around Moore and him. He saw the half-Giant’s shoulders rise and his eyes open wide. Zenol’s teeth ground as he felt the same, familiar power. If only it were enough.
[Ogre’s Strength]. An enchantment stored in the precious scroll. On a half-Giant?
“Launch me. I will end the threat.”
Moore looked down at the [Prince]. The Stitch-man had just whispered that. He stood, poised as if he was standing before a crowd.
Sweating. His eyes were fixed on the tower with the Lich Coven. Thirty mages in the skies.
“You’ll be blasted to pieces.”
“I’ll sever that chain and their combined magic. Nerrhavia’s oath on it.”
“Don’t be a fool—”
Seborn reached for Zenol. He was stopped by Moore. The half-Giant bent.
“Are you sure?”
His arm flexed. Zenol sighed.
“Do it.”
The half-Giant’s right hand held Zenol as the [Prince] balanced. Like a javelin thrower, Moore drew his arm back. He threw Zenol, nearly a hundred feet, staring at his own strength! The [Prince] soared through the burning skies. He touched ground once. The roof. The Liches spotted him and began to aim.
“Too late, wretches. [Like a Lion, He Leapt].”
The [Prince] flew, the momentum of Moore’s throw adding to the second jump. He soared high, higher—
Maybe I won’t make it. Perhaps…he was ashamed of the surge of hope. Perhaps he’d live—
He landed on the tower. The [Prince of Sands] hit the roof and skidded. There—there was the central object the Liches were bound to. His sword flashed once.
The bound, dead [Mage] kneeling in the center of the nest of chains was glowing with magical power, head bowed. Zenol wasn’t even sure if it was undead, or a [Mage] of a different era. It looked up once—he saw a woman smile gratefully.
His falchion severed the top of her head. The Liches screamed. They whirled as the chains shattered. Freed, but weaker. Their fingers pointed down at the man who stood there, sword raised, shouting.
“Nerrhavia’s Fallen!”
The [Prince] laughed, brandishing his sword at the skies and hoping they could see him. He saw the thirty skeleton [Mages] pointing at him, burning spells captured in their fingers.
Fire. A Stitch-person’s worst fear. Zenol’s smile was bitter as he stared at the skies. He had known there was no coming back.
Someone had to do it. Let them never say the [Prince] did not fight like one of them. I could live with their scorn so long as it was never true. 
To prove he was more than a [Prince], he had come here to die. If only he had a second Skill. His father’s legacy…
“Like a lion he leapt. With his pride, he died alone.”
Zenol murmured. He tried to keep smiling as he pivoted, waiting. There was nowhere to dodge. The Liches shrieked again. Their fingers unleashed—
Ksmvr landed on the first Lich’s head. He fired all three crossbows point-blank into the second. Zenol saw him fling something.
