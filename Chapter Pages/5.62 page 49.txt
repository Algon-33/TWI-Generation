“I don’t know. Maybe it’s just…by design. Maybe you’re characters in a game. Maybe that’s where I am. Maybe this is all a dream.”
“A game?”
Reiss looked at Erin. She stared blankly past him.
“Like chess. Pieces on a board.”
He turned. The Goblin Lord saw the chess board on the table. He stood up.
“Chess. A game?”
He walked over to the magical chessboard. Erin nodded. Reiss looked down at the board. He stared at the pawns. The pieces.
He tried to break it. But it was the wrong board. Reiss’ smashed it against the table. He struck it, tried to tear it apart. The magical chessboard refused to break. The Goblin Lord’s grip weakened. The chessboard tumbled to the ground, and he laughed hysterically. Bitterly.
“Not so simple. I tried. Goblin Lords have tried. Kings have tried. We all fail. And we die. Look—”
He turned. Erin saw the light in his eyes fading. Reiss stumbled back to her.
“I tried. I did it all for them. I think I forgot.”
He looked at her. She looked up at him. He was so sad. She hated him. More than anything in the world. But he was crying. He had no tears left, but he was weeping. Reiss sank onto the table. Erin stood with him. The Goblin Lord’s one arm rose. He looked up at her.
“Someday Goblins will know peace. Surely?”
“I—yes.”
“Yes.”
He smiled. But it was a lost smile. Reiss stared past Erin. He had never told her his name.
“Someday. Someday…”
That was all he said. His arm fell back limply. Erin stared down at him. Slowly, she closed his eyes. And then she picked him up.
He was too light. Erin walked with him outside. She stared as the Humans rode towards her. The Drakes. Her friends. They met warily, staring at each other. Enemies. But they stared at her. At the body she held. And then it was truly over.

There were words. Questions. Erin answered none of them. She stood, blankly, until they went away.
She let them have the head. It was what they wanted. But she kept the body. Goblins didn’t really believe in burial, anyways. They ate their dead, when they had to. But he had been like a Human. So she buried him.
There was nowhere to do it around her inn. So Erin found a place amid the dead, where a spell had blown away dirt. She laid him there and covered his body with dirt. Then she found the others.
Some people helped her. Erin made them go away. She found them—some of them. One of them. She buried them and stood up.
Ghosts walked around her. Erin walked back to her inn. It was quiet. She lay down in the kitchen. She stared up at the ceiling for a long time. Her eyes closed. And she heard a voice.

“Shut up!”
 
[Level Ups Cancelled]
 
The voice went away. Erin covered her eyes. And outside her inn, past Liscor, an army marched.
Perhaps it was a dream. Maybe it was a story. A book. And if it was, it was an epic about Tyrion Veltras and his failed attempt to seize Liscor. Or perhaps it was a tale of the Drakes and their valiant defense of their home. Possibly the narrative wasn’t about either. It might have been a saga about Magnolia Reinhart. Or someone else.
