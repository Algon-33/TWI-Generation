This was not his home. But he had seen Gresaria fall. Now—he seized an enchanted javelin and hurled it.
The spear flashed across the distance. At the [Assassin] who had slain the [Lady] of House Wellfar. The figure deflected it, sacrificing his blade as the javelin exploded. But the second one struck his leg and ploughed through, earthing itself in the street.
The enraged [Captain] lifted another spear and a buckler. He ran down the ship. His words a bellow.
“The Harbormistress is dead!”
Someone else took up the cry. A Balerosian [Captain] swung herself off the decks, a Dullahan reaching for her blades.
[Sailors] leapt from their berths. They left the taverns and bars. The [Assassins] turned, seeing an unexpected threat. Sailors? But now another [Captain] from distant Drath had landed. He drew his swords.
Arrows flew from one ship. The first [Captain] to move bellowed at the others.
“To arms! For the pride of the Harbormistress! Every hand, to the blades! To death and the end of the world!”
His crew leapt off the decks, screaming. The [Assassins] looked up, aghast. But then every ship was moving.
They flooded off the ships. [Sailors] and [Pirates]. The Undersea Crews, [Storm Sailors]—for the [Harbormistress].
The pride of the sea. But before they reached the [Assassins]—someone else cried out.
“House Terland, to arms! To arms! Summon the war golems! Eradicate them! Enough!”
A [Lady] cried. Enough! She was as young as Gresaria had been, an age ago. She twisted a ring upon her finger. And her guard-Golems surged forwards.
It was like a breaking wave. The Guild saw nobles turning in the streets. Ordering their guards forwards. Some with blades drew them.
The first Golem of House Terland died, blown apart by dozens of defensive spells. But more were coming. And a distant light flashed.
“The Watcher of First Landing! Kill them!”
House Terland’s golem upon the lighthouse flashed. A beam of light vaporized one of the figures from miles away.
“Summon the armies. Root them out of every city!”
Five Houses were demanding the same thing. And they died.
They did die. [Sailors], [Captains], some of the nobility, going down in the street with arrows or spells tearing at them. [Assassins] leaping into noble houses, trying to reassert the terror.
Too late. Gresaria had tipped the scales already set swaying by Maviola.
No more. The Guild unleashed their spells, tearing apart their foes. They had prepared for this kind of day for centuries. They would not fall to the soft Flowers of Izril. Not without reaping—
A humming sound broke even the battle’s sounds. Men and women looked up, back towards the harbor.
Regein Wellfar stood on the Pride of the Wellfar, the greatest ship of Izril. His rheumy eyes were clear. His body shook, but he had left the bed where he had been confined, lost in memory and time.
“Obliterate them.”
He had a keyspell in his hands. The old [Lord] twisted it. He saw arrows twisting towards him, seeking his life. Too late, though.
The great ship of House Wellfar unleashed its stored magic. The Guild of Assassins, a building concealed by spells and Skills—appeared for the first time.
Ancient, dark stone shuddered. [Assassins] hunkered inside the killing zones looked up.
For a second—the Guild held.
The first spell was blocked. But they were falling out of the sky. Meteors of light. And then—the great capital ship launched a volley of light. Ten thousand magical arrows and a spell that split the skies. A beam of light pierced the defenses of the Guild of Assassins.
