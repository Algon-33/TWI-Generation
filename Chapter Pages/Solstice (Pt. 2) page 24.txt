Solstice (Pt. 2)

“This is not a grand gift! Where are the gemstones? Where the gold?”
“That greedy Wyrm took ours! This is not a grand gift!”
“But it is drink. See? A barrel? And if we were smaller…”
“Mortal drink. Paugh!”
“I say it is good! It is funny! Mortal drink, where we have had none! An offering!”
 
They fought, quarrelling, shoving each other. Ryoka listened, heart pounding, but she sensed more were amused or delighted by the offering than not. At last, one of the more vibrant ones turned to Ryoka. And she laughed.
 
“I say it is well done! I will drink of it! Let the other gifts appease the court! But I give her the right!”
 
The others groused, or nodded, but soon all were nodding.
 
“Yes! The other gifts! What other two have you?”
 
They leered at Ryoka, grinning. Surely you have more?
Gifts always came in three.
Ryoka gulped. By now, more guests were watching. Like the Satyr’s wrath, like everything else this day—this too was entertainment.
“Fifty gold says she fails.”
Lady Pryde muttered to Lord Gralton. The [Dog Lord] snorted. Everyone liked to bet. But Lord Yitton and Shallel Byres did not. Gralton did not.
The [Witches] watched. Aloof from the fae. Silver Pines, Sikeri—
The second ‘gift’ was the pointing of a finger. The fae turned their heads as one. Ryoka had the crazy urge to just run past them. They could be as gullible as children. It might have even worked, if she only needed to grab something.
But she needed their respect. And what could she offer them more than—?
The statue of Ivolethe was far, far larger than life. She touched the marble plinth lightly, one heel and a foot striking the ground, wings spread. Laughing, as she had so often done.
Ivolethe, the Winter Savior.
Ivolethe, the friend.
The Summer Court fixed on the statue of the fae. And they murmured. Perhaps they had ignored the paltry thing of stone—but Ryoka’s finger travelled.
“There. And there. Do you see it?”
More statues. Some made of wood, by a crabby [Carver], others by [Sculptors]. Statues of the Winter Faerie.
 
“She has a statue? But I am a Ritter!”
 
One of the Summer Court cried out, annoyance flashing through his tone. Ryoka looked at the fae.
“It is just stone, immortal folk. Just stone and wood, which does not last. But memory does. And whilst this empire lasts—so too will the statues and Ivolethe’s name!”
 
“What do you offer, mortal?”
 
One of the fae spoke, eyes glittering. He knew. Ryoka smiled.
“A statue for you. And a name, written down for us short-lived people to remember and wonder at. Does it suffice?”
She couldn’t tell how many stood there. They kept shifting. A dozen? A hundred? The Summer Court debated again. It was unconventional. But Ryoka was surer this time.
They wanted to be remembered. A statue for each? They flitted to her.
 
“Made of gold? Jade? Precious metals?”
“Diamond for me?”
“Bone and blood?”
 
“No. Just stone or wood. Painted, if you like.”
Sulking, the fae leapt back to their congregation. And again—they nodded.
 
“We accept! Two gifts, we accept! Last one! Give us something wondrous!”
 
They laughed and applauded her. Statues and drink! Well, it was hardly treasure, or a great artifact or deed, but they accepted! Their eyes fixed on Ryoka greedily.
And she thought—
Oh shit.
Because her last gift was not wondrous. Or grand. If she had had time, she would have tried to prepare a small mountain of Numbtongue’s gems. Something from the inn.
It had all fallen apart. So her last gift? It was more of an afterthought. Ryoka faltered.
