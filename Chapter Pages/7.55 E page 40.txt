Author’s Note: I’m on break! Also, I hate bugs. I really hate bugs. I see one larvae-thing inchworming around and I think I have an infestation.
I…don’t think I do. But you never know! It’s like [Assassins], always hiding in the last place you expect!
Anyways, that was why this chapter was hard. Me taking time to check cupboards and stuff…I’m still paranoid. But there’s no obvious [Assassin] squeezed into my saltshaker, so I might be good.
Ahem. I’m on break until the 3rd of November! But don’t fret! The Patreon poll for the next side story should be up right before this chapter goes live! So if all went well, you can vote on what you read next!
See you then. Until later, I’ll be relaxing and resting my very tired mind and hands so I can deliver more good chapters! And…staring around for bugses. And [Assassins]. See you in a week!
Today’s art is brought to you by ArtsyNada, who I’ve commissioned to do Rasea Zecrew in her poster-recruitment pose! (Artsy has also done other arts, like a kiss between Elirr and Hexel for free! Free!) Also, images of the Walled City and more by mg, and a picture of Laken and Durene by GridCube, among others! Give it appreciation!
