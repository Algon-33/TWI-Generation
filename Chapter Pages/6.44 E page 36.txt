The [Hunter] raised his crossbows. The two [Hunters] dove. Tagil fired twice. Faigen howled as the bolt caught him in the throat. Erashelle screamed. Tagil dodged as she pointed her wand. Faigen was charging, breathless, blood running from his chest.
“[Hail of Bolts].”
The crossbow fired again and again. Faigen jerked as the bolts hit him. Again and again. But he kept coming. Even after they found his heart. Tagil backed up. Faigen collapsed, falling onto him. Tagil stepped to one side. Then rolled. He aimed his crossbows. Fired once. Twice.
Erashelle was still alive. The first bolt had gone through her ribs. But it had missed her heart. Both of her hands were nailed to the wall. She kept trying to cast a spell as Tagil walked towards her. He aimed the crossbows. But she was already dying. She spat blood, the bolts blocking her magic.
“You—traitor. Damn you.”
“I’m sorry..”
Tagil’s eyes burned. He looked at her. She spat. Her lung was filling. She coughed, choking the last words out.
“I hope you suffer forever. If there’s anything—hope you—”
Then she died. Tagil stared at her corpse. Then at Faigen. His hands shook. He dropped the crossbows. The [Hunter] fell to his knees, as bile filled his throat. And his tears lasted as long as Erashelle’s blood kept dripping to the floor. And he screamed his damnation.
Then the man stood. And his eyes were empty. But one last purpose moved him onwards. He left the house, left his crossbows. Walked through silent Riverfarm. Past the [Knights] whom he placated with lies. He walked onwards. Out of Riverfarm, slowly following a thread that called him.
She was waiting for him there. At a tree far enough from the village it hadn’t been cut, on a small hill.
Belavierr. The man looked up at her.
“It’s done.”
She nodded. And her eyes shone with orange light. He stared at her with hatred. Regret.
“Raim lives. I’ve done my part. Now. Will she…?”
“Yes. Do you want me to repeat our pact? I have sworn it.”
Belavierr’s voice was cold. Tagil shuddered. He walked up the hill.
“No. Keep your oath, [Witch].”
She had left something for him there. And she helped him stand on the stool. Tagil stared at her. He spat into her face. She never blinked.
“I will keep my promise. It will be fulfilled in the hour after your death. Regardless of my fate.”
“I hope Raim burns you away.”
“He may.”
But that was not his business. Tagil closed his eyes. The hemp rope hung around his neck.
“Will you tell him I’m sorry? Will you tell her what I did?”
“I did not promise that.”
“Then I curse you, Belavierr the Witch. I curse you. But save my daughter. I did it for her.”
Tagil took a deep breath. And he stepped off the stool. The noose tugged. His neck snapped.
That was how they found him. As dawn broke, as the three bodies were found inside the warded house by Ryoka Griffin and the [Knights] found they had battled only puppets that collapsed as the sun rose.
He hung there. On the hilltop. From the longest limb of the tree. Ser Raim’s scream still echoed. His despair. Betrayal. The [Hunter] stared sightlessly at the [Summer Knight].
And there she stood. As tall as the hanging body. Her eyes glowing in the light of the rising sun. Raim stared up at Belavierr.
“What did you offer him? What did you give him? His daughter? Was it you?”
His hands shook. His face was ashen. Belavierr looked down at him.
“No. But I offered him her life. A charm to protect her. It is already sent.”
“A charm? He betrayed all for a charm?”
Raim choked. Belavierr nodded. Her eyes were distant. She smelled of smoke and fire.
