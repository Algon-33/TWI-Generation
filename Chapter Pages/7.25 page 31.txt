He snapped at her. The young woman laughed. She stood up, backed off as the movie began to play. The Dragon saw the screen showing a vivid movie screen. He blinked. Ryoka had no movies on her iPhone.
“For my third wish, I want you to watch this.”
“What is this?”
For answer, Ryoka just sat down. The Dragon hesitated, but edged closer. Someone was speaking. He blinked.
“Are those…Dwarves? They look nothing like…well, that one doesn’t. Too much Human blood. Inbreeding between species.”
“Shush. This is a movie.”
“A what? Is this like one of the podcasts?”
“No. Shush. It’s a story.”
Ryoka saw the Dragon narrow his eyes. He was eying her backside, about to eject her from his cave. But then—his head snapped up.
“Dragon? Where?”
And then, there was one. On the screen. Teriarch gaped. Ryoka laughed at his expression.
“This is a story about Dragons?”
Damn Kevin. He had a lot of pirated movies—he hadn’t paid for a single one. And he hadn’t even the decency to pirate the original Lord of the Rings movies. But here was a new one.
The Hobbit began playing as Ryoka sat back. Teriarch was stunned as screaming Dwarves filled the screen.
“I thought you said this world didn’t have Dragons. Are those—that armor is completely unrealistic. That’s not a Dragon. Look at those scales! Does he have some kind of plague? Or is he just dirty?”
He pointed at the fleshy-scales, not at all like his shining metallic scales. Ryoka shushed him.
“It’s a movie. The creators never saw Dragons. They came up with this story based on a book. It’s famous.”
“It’s inaccurate. Not pillaging a Dwarven city. We did that all the time. Although only a fool would go to Deríthal-vel. Other Dwarven kingdoms in the past—yes. But I wouldn’t battle the Dwarves inside…”
Ryoka saw the Dragon focus on the first action scene she’d skipped ahead to. He blinked.
“Are those Elves?”
“Are they realistic?”
Ryoka glanced up at him swiftly. The Dragon blinked. Harrumphed.
“How should I know? They were before my time; most of them. Only a few survived the—although—they might be half-Elves. Rather ugly. Wait. Wait. What is that?”
A Hobbit appeared on the screen. Ryoka smiled as the music began playing. And the Dragon’s protestations faded. She sat back as the Brass Dragon edged forwards. She was smiling. Then—she saw his face crumple.
“Oh. Tamaroth’s…Halflings.”
Ryoka saw his eyes glistening. She looked up at him. But the Dragon’s sadness was only for a moment. He watched, spellbound, as the movie continued.
“And Humans made this?”
“Oh, yes. I…saw this only once.”
She’d been very upset too, especially about Radagast. But Ryoka couldn’t remember why she’d been so upset. The movie was…beautiful. Something not of this world. The young woman cleared her throat, nervous beyond anything else.
“Do you want to watch? I thought—we could watch it. Route Z. I mean—if I’m bothering you, I’ll go.”
“No. Keep it playing. It’s so small.”
“Sorry. The screen’s small. If we had a projector, we could make it—”
The Dragon snapped his claws. A replica of the screen appeared in front of them. Perfectly magnified. Ryoka gaped. The shimmering window in the air began playing.
And the two sat there. Ryoka glanced up at the Dragon. Then sat back against one claw. He started. Looked down at her. But then grunted.
“Go find something else to lie on. I am not your pillow.”
He flicked her off. Ryoka swore, but then—she found a pillow stuffed with unicorn hair or some shit in his pile and walked back over.
“You know, you eat food with movies.”
“Like what? Also—be silent.”
The Dragon was distracted. Ryoka sat down on the pillow.
