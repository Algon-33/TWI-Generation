Fearless, ignoring the pain. Lily saw The Griffin Prince cutting, slashing with controlled attacks at the [Sword Captain]. Using skill, combat experience against Skills.
Another cut actually bisected him along his right shoulder. But the black thread sewed the [Prince] together. He came on. Wearing the [Sword Captain] down by cuts, forcing him backwards.
Because The Griffin Prince had no Skills to use. He could die. Be defeated. His resurrection took time. An enemy could blind him, keep hacking him apart. But the [Prince] was experienced. He had been fighting since he was a child.
He caught the [Sword Captain] at last. The man dodged back too slow. The buckler stunned him. The [Prince]’s axe hacked deep into where neck met shoulder.
“No—”
The man fumbled for a healing potion. But the cut was mortal. He fell, choking, as The Griffin Prince gave him no chance to rise. The axe fell twice.
Dead. The [Mercenaries] saw-felt the [Captain] die. They fled. They’d been hacked apart by the superior [Griffin Riders]. Despite the disparity in numbers.
“After them!”
Lily shouted. The Griffin Prince raised one hand.
“No. Let them leave. Ailendamus is provoked enough. Let them go.”
He was panting. The other [Griffin Riders] grumbled. The [Prince] pulled himself upright. He looked around tiredly.
The girl from Earth heard a sound. The [Farmer] and his family were staring at the damned [Prince]. He turned to them.
“Are you al—”
They fled, screaming. And why not? They had seen him die. Seen the curse, laid on him when he was a boy.
The Griffin Prince’s shoulder slumped. Lily spat after the group that had fled. So did the other [Griffin Riders].
“Ungrateful bastards. But for us, Kaliv would’ve lost its grain. Should we loot some? Or burn the fields ourselves, boss?”
One scarred man leaned out of his saddle. The Griffin Prince looked up.
“No. We fly. Take nothing.”
The former [Marauder] grimaced. But he, like Lily, did not object to the orders. They followed the [Prince] willingly.
And they flew, through the sky. Following their cursed, exiled [Prince]. Lillian flew after the man who had tracked down the [Bandit] group she’d joined. Who’d refused to die. And who had offered her redemption or death.
The Griffin Prince of Kaliv. The shame of the royal family. The boy who had made a pact with a [Witch], for his very soul. The exile who defended his lands until he could find his death.
With him flew a [Murderer]. A [Marauder]. A [Rapist]. Disgraced [Knights]. People beyond redemption. Cowards and killers.
Kaliv’s Wing of Shame. They were offered one last chance. So they spent their lives in battle. And Lillian Woods was among them.
“I’m tired, Lily. Tell me a story from your home. Another fantastical story.”
That was all The Griffin Prince said after they returned to their hidden base. The young Canadian woman smiled crookedly. She looked at him.
A man grown. More honorable than any other ‘noble’ despite his curse. Dedicated to defending his home even when no one would offer him more than insults.
And yet—a boy still. Unchanged from the day he had made a mistake and been cursed—blessed—changed by the most powerful [Witch] in this world.
He was a [Prince], yes. A Level 6 [Prince]. And he looked at Lily as he closed his eyes. Seeking his end. Seeking word of the Stitch Witch, that he might be freed. If war came, The Griffin Prince would fly.
But he could never die. Lillian Woods had tried to convince him to leave his self-appointed guardianship. To seek his enemy. But he had refused. He loved her fantastical stories. Even if he didn’t believe them.
