Lord Tyrion Veltras had been told. The Circle of Thorns had decided to kill Lady Magnolia Reinhart. Unlike the Couriers—they wanted her well and truly dead.
The [Assassin] with the blade never got to the carriage to begin taking it apart. One of the doors blew open. He leapt backwards as the [Assassins] braced. One threw a dart which exploded—but Ressa blocked the projectile. She leapt out, a blur, slashing with the deadly, poisoned dagger, the Vision of Grasses, as the other [Assassins] spread out. Behind her were the two [Maids]—Magnolia Reinhart remained, at least for a moment.
“Ressa.”
Ieka watched the [Maid] slashing at the first [Assassin]. She was flinging objects down. Scrolls, magical artifacts—anything and everything she had.

“Watch out. She used to be a Face.”
There were five of them. The [Trapmaster Assassin], the white-haired man that Ryoka and Fierre had met, was one. He eyed Ressa, then withdrew glittering lines of metal.
Wires. He flung them into the air as the [Assassins] held their ground, appraising Ressa’s dance with their [Blademaster]. Five of them. They were cautious; mostly of the blade or artifacts. And they were waiting for the [Trapmaster] to give them an advantage.
The wires were mithril. They were long and the oldest of the [Assassins] threw them far, anchoring them to the ground, points in the very air. And then he spoke his great Skill.
“[Create Field: The Steelthread Web].”
The world changed. If the grass and road was the world they knew—the [Trapmaster] created a world within it. A place guarded by razor-sharp wires, preventing escape. Set too with invisible threads, ready to slice his enemies apart.
Invisible to all but his allies. He stepped back, guarded in his lair, and loaded a crossbow.
“Your turn.”
Mire had changed. The woman—was still female. But her body had shifted with the draught she had taken. Now, a Minotauress clenched a fist.
“I don’t like that artifact. Combo Skill?”
“Wait until she sets up.”
Ressa dodged backwards as the [Blademaster Assassin] slashed at her. She’d taken three cuts, but none of them had missed how the enchanted blade failed to leave a mark on her maid’s uniform.
“High-grade artifact. And here come the summons.”
They stepped back as Ressa threw summoning talismans from Drath, calling every artifact she had. The other [Maids] were opening scrolls, no doubt calling for help, buffing themselves—
“…That’s a Hydra.”
A huge monster roared upwards as multiple heads flashed from the most powerful talisman. The [Trapmaster] saw it rise higher—then crash into the wires he’d set up. It was hampered, although the wires couldn’t slice it apart.
“Looks like a lot of high-grade monster summons.”
He calmly shot an emerging monster through the head and the magical summon vanished before it even fully formed.
Five of them. The [Blademaster] was pursuing Ressa as agreed, a single-minded duelist. Another of them moved now.
“I’ll down that Hydra. One of you kill the [Lady].”
“That’s Mire. Who wants the maids?”
“Me.”
One of them was armed with a huge cloak which shifted as he threw more magical darts. The two [Maids] and Sacra took cover, using wands to attack back as the [Assassin] locked them down. That left just Mire and the [Assassin] who had cast the [Fireball]. She pointed at the Hydra trying to attack the enemies.
“[True Lightning].”
A bolt of lightning as powerful as the kind that struck from the heavens hit the Hydra. The [Trapmaster] shielded his eyes; when he looked, one of the Hydra’s heads was a smoldering ruin. The monster reeled as the [Mage Assassin] shook his head.
