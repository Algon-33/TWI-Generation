“[Flare Wyvern].”
He conjured a fiery form that flew at the Hydra. The [Trapmaster] shot his crossbow again. He was watching Mire.
“Go.”
Ressa was tangled by the wires and the [Blademaster]. The [Maids] locked down. Mire charged the carriage, her Minotaur-form rampaging forwards.

Magnolia Reinhart lay there, on her front, disoriented. She wasn’t…hurt. The powerful protective ring had worked. But she couldn’t understand—
They were under attack. It was a trap. The [Lady] slowly reached for her earring. She had to—to—Ressa had told her to stay put. Sensible. But she had to—
“Teriarch? We’re under attack…”
She whispered. And got no response.

The Dragon lay sleeping.

The [Lady] looked up as the Minotauress wrenched open the carriage door. She fumbled for the artifacts she carried—Mire dragged her out. The clients wanted this done in the open. Magnolia was reaching for her hand—something—
“Lady Reinhart.”
Mire dragged Magnolia up. The [Lady] fought—but the [Alchemist]-[Martial Artist] was impossibly strong even without her form. She held Magnolia there, turned her—
“[Piercing Shot].”
The [Trapmaster] fired his crossbow straight into Magnolia’s chest. He saw the enchanted quarrel strike the [Lady] just above the bosom of her pink dress.
And bounce off. Mire stared at the quarrel, lying on the ground. The [Trapmaster] blinked.
“That’s some powerful ring. Mire—”
“Off of me, please. [Deft—”
Mire went flying. The [Lady] looked around. She twisted a second ring on her finger, looking around. The [Trapmaster] felt his [Dangersense] go insane.
“Relic-class artifact! Mire!”
Magnolia Reinhart was not unguarded. Teriarch had given her his ring. And she had another artifact.
The glowing, crimson beam of light shot from her ring. The same artifact that had killed the ‘Great Mage’ Nemor. She lifted her ring, choosing her target—the [Blademaster] after Ressa. The [Maid] knew to dodge away—
The Minotauress grabbed Magnolia’s hand. The [Lady] jerked; and the Minotauress twisted her arms up effortlessly. The ring glowed. The beam of magic locked into the air as the [Assassins] took cover. The Minotauress leapt away—
The air caught fire. The crimson explosion and flash of light shot into the sky like a beacon, visible for miles. And it hit—no one. Magnolia blinked in shock. Then she saw the Minotauress running at her. This time, Magnolia was a touch too slow.

“[Shockwave Palm]!”
Mire hit the [Lady] in the chest with an open palm. The [Trapmaster] saw the [Lady] go flying.
Like a doll. She hit the wires and he winced, waiting to see pieces of her landing. But the [Lady] just bounced off the wires and lay on the ground, stunned.
“What caliber of protection ring is that? I want it.”
“I’ll take that attack-ring.”
Mire had leapt back as Ressa forced the [Blademaster] back. Like her mistress, her ring had shrugged off every attack and she’d used that to score a slash on his arm. The three [Assassins] moved back.
“I’m poisoned.”
The [Blademaster] looked at the venom spreading impossibly fast over his arm. The [Trapmaster] sighed.
“Relic blade too. I’ll stop the poison. Thesil—stop Ressa.”
The [Mage Assassin] turned and began throwing spells at the [Head Maid]. Mire grimaced.
“That [Lady]—”
“You know what to do. Give me five minutes. Hold still. If the toxin spreads within one minute, cut your arm off.”
The [Blademaster] nodded tightly; his arm was already wrapped in mithril wires to stop the blood flow. The [Trapmaster] rapidly took out potions and antidotes.
