“Miss Rose. I have killed people. I have killed monsters. I have killed birds, and rats that eat the food here. I do not feel guilty about killing things. Some things must die. Hectval is one of them. You cannot change my mind. Nothing you say can.”
He aimed the bow at them and they flinched aside. Bird walked past them, and Selys followed.
“Bird—if Erin was here—she’d stop you.”
“Yes. And she is not. So no one can.”
There was calm, pained certainty in his words. Selys looked at Rose and Ishkr. What could they say? They had to go for Zevara, then. But surely…surely there was something that could be said, or done. But what?
If only she was here. And she was. But Selys did not know the words. Selys looked at his back. At last, she spoke quietly, as he was putting the last of the arrows into the bag of holding.
“Bird. We can’t stop you. But if Erin was standing here, and she heard what you wanted to do, if you did it and she woke up—she would cry. She would not want this.”
Bird halted, hand on the last arrows, the one made with Bevussa’s feather. He looked up at her. For the first time, he wavered, dropped an arrow.
“But she is not here.”
That was all he said. He turned, and resumed picking up arrows.

Ulvama gently patted Mrsha’s head. The Gnoll was drifting off when she heard the curse.
“Aaah! Again! Giant’s poo!”
The [Shaman] waved her clawed hand. Mrsha jerked. Was something wrong? She looked up and saw—
A glowing flame. Mrsha’s eyes went round. It burned bright and clear. It gave off such a pure light it almost hurt. And it was blue.
But not the blue of winter, the blue of depression and darkness. This was the same color as the brilliant sky. The color, like fresh air. Like…
Hope. Mrsha stared at it. It could not be. But only one flame burned so. She reached for it—
Ulvama blew it out and wiped the fragments on the grass.
“Gah! Everywhere!”
She glowered at her hand, checking to see if it was burnt—
Mrsha tackled her. She began pounding Ulvama with her fists—gently—beating her. The [Shaman] yelped.
“Stop! Stop it! What is wrong with you?”
She yanked Mrsha off her. The Gnoll was trembling. She pointed at Ulvama’s claw. You! What did you do? It was there and it went out!
Ulvama stared at Mrsha, then the fire.
“You know what that is? Keeps getting on you. There!”
She pointed at Mrsha’s paw, accusingly. Mrsha gazed at it, hopeful, then confused. She saw nothing—Ulvama scooped something up. She eyed it—then hurled it down and began to stomp.
“Stupid—magic—fire—”
Mrsha went for a leg. Ulvama toppled over and Mrsha looked around desperately for…
She saw nothing. She sagged. Then looked furiously at Ulvama. The [Shaman] raised her staff protectively.
“Stop it! Why that flame matter so much? Too many weird fires! Bad if it burns all over!”
She squawked, defensively. Mrsha opened and closed her mouth. How could she even explain? It was Erin’s fire.
How had Ulvama gotten it on her claws? Mrsha remembered Erin’s last flame going out. She had been so…it had been…
Ulvama saw Mrsha’s mouth opening and closing. She scratched her head, sighing.
“Little Gnoll-child. Too bad your mouth doesn’t work, eh? It would be so much easier if I could understand what you were saying!”
She grumbled, shaking her head. Mrsha looked at her. She held up a single paw and felt at her waist. Then remembered she had no belt pouch. She ran for the closest wall of the garden.
Bemused, Ulvama watched. She saw Mrsha come racing back with quill and paper. She began writing furiously. Ulvama blinked.
“You. You can write?”
