He stares at me, and then walks out of the mirror’s range. I sit on the bed, hearing his voice, my voice, in my ears.
“Think about it. Demon soldiers, appearing in the middle of the night? How? And they just so happen to know where the [Princesses] are sleeping? That’s hard to do, even for assassins. If they were assassins.”
I remember seeing the dead guard out of Erille’s room and shudder.
“They seemed pretty intent on killing to me.”
I feel my eyes roll.
“Yes. I guess they did. All two of them. And there were two for the other princess. None for the Blighted King, his Queen, or anyone else. Why’s that?”
No response. I get back up, go back to the mirror. Tom stares at me. The black pits of his eyes are dark. Fathomless. I look away.
Someone organized my belongings, such as they are. I glance down at my tin of grease paint, play with the freshly laundered clown suit as he talks.
“This is just the start. You know that. And you might have killed two Demons, but you know you’re nothing without me.”
“I’m me. You’re in my head. And you can’t control me. I proved that just now. Yesterday, I mean.”
“Oh yeah?”
He laughs. I look up and glare at him in the mirror. He glares back, and then grins. And then the grin freezes. It slides off my face and I study myself. I shake my head.
“It’s all me. See?”
I wait. The reflection doesn’t respond. I go on.
“Me. I pretend. I get it now. I’m doing this. And I can stop. It’s my choice. Maybe I like thinking I’m insane. But I’m not. And if I don’t let you have a thing, you can stay a voice in my head for all I care.”
No response. I smile bitterly.
“Good chat. Let’s never do this again. I win. No—there was never anyone to play against, was there? Just me.”
I turn. I hear no voice, no mocking reply. It is just me.
Then I hear a whisper in my head.
So you say. I left a little present for you, though. A little reminder I’m here. Want me to tell you what it is?
I ignore the voice. Turn. What’s the old expression again? Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words…
Words can hurt. Of course they can. And thoughts can be terrible. But they will not control me.
It’s time for the banquet. I absently get ready in front of the mirror. I don’t have many good pairs of clothes, but I do make sure I have a few knives up my sleeves. Just in case.
And then I go. Voiceless. I stride out of the bedroom, feeling better than I have in months. A new room, a friend in the Fool, and some measure of respect. And who knows? Maybe things can get better than this. I don’t know, but I’m hopeful.
I might just enjoy tonight after all.

I get lost on the way to the banquet hall again. It’s my new room. Plus, I never got to know the old one that well. It’s also hard to get directions. All the servants just stare at me and point. I guess they still don’t think I’m that much of a hero. I know I’m not.
But I still get to the banquet hall in good time. The [Chamberlain] blinks when he sees me, but points me to the table with my friends.
I sense heads turning as I enter the room. People watching me, murmuring. I hate that. But I also know that they’ll stop as soon as something else happens. Give me a week, a month, and people will barely remember my name, let alone call me a hero.
My friends are sitting with their backs to me, laughing with the Drakes. I know I should sit with the nobles, but I want to talk to them first, say hi. Maybe ask if Lady Zekyria has a husband. I dunno, I’m feeling very lucky. Although that’s probably pushing any amount of luck I’d ever have.
“Hey guys. What’s up?”
