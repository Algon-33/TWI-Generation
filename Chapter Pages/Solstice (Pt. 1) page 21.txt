Solstice (Pt. 1)

“You have to perform. And make it one for the history books, Wesle, Jasi, Emme. You have to perform. You know the guests are…special?”
“Winter Sprites?”
Ryoka stirred. Jasi sniffed.
“I was there with Erin. And—his Majesty told us in confidentiality. He knows you, Ryoka?”
“He’s a friend of Erin’s. Or…would have been. Listen. You have to perform.”
“I don’t know if I can cover this grief with a smile. But I could do a sad play—if there were one wretched enough for me.”
Wesle muttered. Ryoka looked at him.
“No. You have to be better than you ever have before. Wesle. Jasi. Perform your best. And there’s a chance…we’ll be able to bring Erin back.”
The Players of Celum looked at her. Lord Gralton tilted his head. Ryoka didn’t notice that, or the other listeners. It didn’t matter.
“You’re not making sense, Ryoka. Lyonette said there was a chance—”
“This is that chance. I put together this party for—it doesn’t matter. I have something new to do. Even if I have to throw it all to the wind, I’ll bring Erin back first if I can. But they must come. They must be entertained. This must be the greatest party ever. We have the guests. Now we need entertainment. A moment.”
“Are you being serious, Ryoka?”
The Wind Runner turned. She saw a huge, bald, bearded man with a throat worn by sobs. Kilkran. His eyes were red. But he had her shoulder in a fierce grip.
“So help me, but if you are lying to us in any way—I will show you wrath that Macduff never showed Macbeth!”
As threats went, it wasn’t the most impressive. But—Ryoka looked Kilkran in the eyes and then around at the other [Actors].
“Cast a truth spell if you want to. There is a chance. Just a chance. But you have to perform and get the other guests to arrive.”
“There’s a chance they won’t even show?”
Pralcem was astonished. But the others were regaining their spirit. Ryoka saw it. Emme’s head rose.
“Picky?”
“The most. Can you do it?”
“Are you—”
Wesle coughed. He looked around. Suddenly, the color was in his cheeks. His voice rose, and heads turned at that sound, that ineffable quality captured there.
“Are you serious, Ryoka Griffin? If there were one chance in a million—Players of Celum! Stop weeping and on your feet! We have performances to get to! Get the stage set! Get the B-team out of their rooms!”
“Move! Move! We have to set up for A Midsummer’s Night Dream—but if we need performances, I want our best! Macbeth in thirty minutes or I’ll feed all of you to the crows!”
Galvanized, the [Actors] surged off. Ryoka turned. She realized—someone was standing next to her. But he was short, so she’d mistook him for Emme and missed him in the crowd.
“I heard the same. Told the lad to come here. Is it true?”
Dawil looked up at her. Ryoka looked down at the Dwarf. Helmetless, grief-stricken. But determined.
“Yes. It’s only a chance. But it is a chance.”
He exhaled slowly.
“How?”
For an answer—Ryoka showed him the statue of Ivolethe.
“Winter Sprites.”
His eyes flickered. The Dwarf looked at Ryoka.
“In that case—you might want to get settled in. I heard the party’s all day and into the night. And now you’re here, it should get rolling, right?”
“Absolutely.”
Behind Ryoka, Lady Ieka Imarris’ eyes glittered. This was no time for the Circle of Thorns. The Circle was broken. But this—she felt like this was just as important.
Today, she would have her answers. She strode towards Ryoka Griffin. Many people wanted to speak to her. From Ulva Terland to Tyrion, to Sammial to Laken Godart. She should have secured Ryoka beforehand. But this day—
