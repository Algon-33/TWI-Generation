Slowly, Erin walked into the kitchen. She bent, and fished around in the bag of food she’d bought. There it was. Was it enough? It would be enough.
Erin looked around, and picked up the cast iron cooking pot. It was small. But it would do.
All the embers in the kitchen’s fireplace had long since turned to ash. Erin tossed in a few pieces of wood and slowly bent to strike sparks. It was slow. The horn kept calling, louder and louder. But her hands never wavered. She was still dreaming.
At last the fire caught. Erin fed the small blaze and it grew slowly. She added enough wood and set the pot above the fire. It would be hot soon enough. The fire was growing.
That was it. Erin filled the pot to the brim with the item she’d taken from the shopping bag. Then she put the lid on the pot. Slowly, she walked back into the main room of the inn. And sat down.
The horn blew. It was from right outside the inn. Erin heard the Goblin’s heavy footsteps now, the rattle of his metal armor. He paused before the door.
Thud.
The door rattled. The chairs and tables blocking it moved from the force of the impact. Erin stared at the door.
“It’s all just a game.”
She whispered to herself. She didn’t believe it.
Thud.
Another impact. This time Erin heard cracking. The door wouldn’t last. She had seconds left.
Thud.
The fire was starting in the kitchen. It would take time to heat the pot. Was it enough? It would have to be enough.
Thud.
The entire door shook. Erin saw the wood splinter around the hinges. She waited. Death was in her bones. But whether it was hers she didn’t know.
“Knight to D4. Pawn to E3.”
She didn’t want to die. But it might be better then what came next. Erin closed her eyes.
“I truly hate this world.”
The door crashed inwards and the Goblin Chieftain stepped into the inn.
