Olesm lowered his blade. Captain Vell was racing towards him with all the forces he’d left with the prisoners. He stared at her. Blood was on her armor and blade.
“Vell?”
“They sent a group to free the prisoners! They’re all free, I’m sorry, Strategist!”
She panted.
“Then we have to retreat!”
“No—they’re on the run!”
“How? There have to be three, four times your number—”
“We got their leader! And they’re running from the fire things! The elementals!”
“The—”
Olesm saw the burning figure appear in the distance. A towering being of pure flame was pursuing a group of fleeing prisoners and Hectval’s rescue team. She rode up towards him, a glowing blade in her hand.
“Maviola.”
Maviola El slowed her horse as she reached the pass. She looked ahead and cursed.
“Our rear is secure! I put a sea of flames at our backs! Now there is only this army!”
She was panting. Her riding clothes were bloodied in two places, and healed. She looked at Olesm.
“You colossal fool. What are you doing?”
Olesm looked at her.
“Maviola…? I’m so sorry. I led us into a trap—”
“Strategist! Orders?”
Olesm didn’t respond. Maviola looked around.
“Captain! Take your squad up and harass those [Mages]! Olesm—wake up!”
She drew alongside him. Her horse was panting. Olesm just shook his head.
“I’m a failure of a [Strategist]. I let my anger get the best of me—look. They’re getting killed.”
Jeiss’ momentum was slowing. The Flamewardens had run out of fire. The fliers were swarming around Bevussa. Maviola saw it all. She looked at Olesm. Then she slapped him.
It was a brisk blow. The Drake jerked. He felt himself wake up a bit. Maviola’s hand was scorching.
“What are you doing? Why have you pulled back like this? Advance! Why did you take those soldiers prisoner?”
“I—I couldn’t execute them!”
“So you decided to do exactly what they wanted? Stop playing their game, Olesm! I taught you more of war than that!”
The [Lady] snapped. Her eyes flashed. She looked around.
“This battle isn’t lost. Why is Moore alone? Advance! Forwards! You—advance after that half-Giant!”
She pointed to Menolit. The Drake swore.
“On me!”
He shouted and Drakes and Gnolls and Humans surged forwards. Olesm started.
“They’re going to die, Maviola!”
“This is war, Olesm. You know that! You have led men and women before! I have played games of strategy with you! Why are you holding back?”
She gripped his shoulder. Her hand left a smoldering imprint on his scales. This was not the time for the conversation. But she gripped him.
“Take the battle to them. Even if there is a cost—I did not come to help you retreat. Did you not swear to burn Hectval for Erin Solstice?”
“But—”
The rage had cooled in Olesm. Now he flinched at Maviola’s words. Burn the city? The innocents? She looked at him. Maviola’s ire cooled, slightly.
“You have not wept. Nor are you as furious as you should be. Look. There!”
She pointed at Moore. The half-Giant roared his fury out. Unstoppable despite Hectval’s attempts to down him. Maviola shouted.
“That is how furious you should be! Did you not love Erin Solstice as much as the others? Where is your rage, Olesm?”
He shook at her words.
“I’m—afraid. Afraid of myself. I was about to execute those prisoners. I nearly killed a [Commander]—”
“So you did not weep? Did you shed a tear for Erin? Did you not feel the fury of her death?”
“She’s not dead—”
Maviola struck Olesm again. Then she put her hands on his cheeks. And they were cooler. Still warm. She looked into his eyes with her ember-orange ones.
