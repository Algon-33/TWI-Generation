Pisces’ face was pale. He looked at Montressa. To the side, Ksmvr looked at Palt and Ulinde. He aimed the bow in their direction.
“Is it battle, then? You are both off-guard. And I understand that killing you before a duel has begun would be considered improper. I would not wish to disgrace my team.”
“What? No. We have to stop this!”
Palt cried out. He was going over the list of his spells, desperately, but he knew Montressa’s abilities. Ksmvr nodded.
“I see. In that case—I am content to watch also. If you move, I will kill you.”
The Centaur froze. Ulinde turned. Ksmvr aimed the bow straight between her eyes. The adventurers scattered around them.
“No! We have to stop them!”
She tried to step left, but Ksmvr pulled and she froze. Palt raised his hands.
“Look—Ksmvr? We need to stop our team. Let us go and—”
“No. I do not believe you.”
“We’ll pull them apart! Don’t you—why don’t you believe us?”
The Antinium tilted his head.
“Because that is what I would say to allay suspicion before I killed both of you in a surprise attack. Move and I will shoot.”
“They’re going to die. This is madness.”
The [Skirmisher]’s voice was calm.
“No, it was inevitable, I think. Your leader, Montressa, is beyond reason. So Pisces must kill her.”
“She could kill him! You don’t know Montressa—”
Ksmvr shook his head. He never turned his head as the five [Mages] and Yvlon took their distance.
“He will not lose. My teammates will not fall, any of them. Or I would be in error. And my reason for living would be torn away. Watch.”
They did. Stan was arguing with Ceria, trying to convince her to halt. But it wasn’t in the half-Elf’s control. Pisces stood apart from Montressa. Yvlon was advancing towards Beza at a walk as the Minotaur read from her scrolls. Isceil pointed his wand at Ceria.
“Move clear, adventurers. This is a duel. Between all present. A duel of honor, which is more than the [Necromancer] deserves.”
“You bastard. Didn’t you hear a word he said? Get away, Stan.”
The old adventurer retreated, shaking his head. Ceria had drawn her own wand. Ice formed along the tip as she aimed it angrily at Isceil. The Drake sneered.
“I heard pretty lies. Anyone can lie, half-Elf. Even to truth spells. And everyone’s a victim in their own book.”
“Montressa. You can walk away. Promise me. The Academy doesn’t want me. It’s you. Swear not to come after me. Swear. Please.”
Pisces looked at Montressa. For a moment, Ceria saw the rage clear in Montressa’s eyes. She looked at him, and hesitated. Fear and loathing and anger. But it wasn’t enough. She shook her head and lifted her staff.
“Me? How could I believe you?”
Pisces bowed his head.
“Yes. How could you?”
There was no signal. Yvlon’s pace accelerated as Beza’s sixth scroll scrambled to dust in her hands. The Minotaur began advancing, her fists clenched. She was wearing a shining, glowing magical gauntlet about her own fists and she moved too quickly. Ceria looked at Pisces and Montressa. They were still. The orb was rotating slowly around Montressa’s staff as the magic gathered about both.
“Ceria!”
Ksmvr’s voice was a warning. Ceria jerked her head up. The first [Fireball] shot towards her face. She flung herself left as she screamed.
“[Ice Wall]!”
The fire struck ice. The explosion hurled Ceria to the ground. And then it was battle.

The workers at the road stared. Master Builder Reikhle snarled, watching the battle.
“Fools.”
