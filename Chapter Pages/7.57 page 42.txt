Author’s Note: I still didn’t get quite where I wanted to. But this is a good stopping place. I think…well, we’ll see if next chapter encompasses it all. If not, you know, this is a web serial.
And this is short-er than last chapter! By two thousand words, true, which is still longer than average. But I made myself a promise and I did it!
Funny story. I thought it was Friday, which goes to show how I’ve lost track of unimportant things. The Unus Annus channel is ending, hence me sharing that. If you haven’t heard of it—it’s too late.
Memento Mori. A good theme for this chapter. And the next one. So it begins and ends. I think you know what might happen next. Or do you?
Have a good night and see you next time!
 
Tonight’s art comes to you from ArtsyNada, who has done one last comic about how half-Elves speak to beavers! Also, Scap has commissioned two art pieces of Numbtongue and Erin! Last and certainly not least, LeChat has created some amazing work and Enyavar has colored some of them! Credit where credit is due—take a look and leave praise!
