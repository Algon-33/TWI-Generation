The [Bard] was commanding without his lyre. Erin sat. She inhaled. And after a while, she felt better.
“…They’re wrong. Whatever they told you. I’m not like—someone from stories.”
“Oh, really?”
The [Bard] was adjusting his lyre. In the main part of the restaurant, it sounded like the staff were doing their best to regain the night. Erin heard the fwoosh of someone grilling something hard. Barelle nodded to Erin.
“What you perceive about yourself is not what others see. But tell me, Miss Solstice. What makes you unworthy of the praise?”
Erin didn’t even have to think. She shook her head.
“It’s just not true. Those things happened—but it wasn’t me. I’ve never been a heroic, super-brave person who can solve things. I have never beaten those monsters or saved anyone alone. All I have done on my own is kill people. But I have amazing friends. Heroes have stayed in my inn. And I fed them waffles.”
He laughed. Erin tried to smile.
“I’m sorry. I should have just said ‘no’ and let everyone else have the party. I’m bad at them. I can throw a party—in my inn. But out here?”
She shuddered. All those people staring at her.
“I don’t want to be treated like that. I get nervous. Horribly sweaty. I’d rather be…”
In her room, playing a game of chess with her opponent. Curled up reading Mrsha a story. That was fun for Erin.
The [Bard] nodded understandingly.
“And that is perfectly fine. I confess—Miss Emme talked you up so much I thought you would love my performance. I should have looked at you first. Again, I apologize. It is my job. I’ll leave you; I just wanted to check up on you. Shall I tell your friends you’re well?”
“Yes. Please. Thank you, and again, I’m sorry.”
The [Bard] smiled.
“Miss Solstice, we’ll certainly speak again. If only because your unusual friend seems to want to inspect my lyre. How ever did you find a fellow student of the craft among Goblins?”
She stared at him. Barelle winked.
“[Know Thy Audience]. I’d better earn some gold.”
He left. Erin wanted to talk to him. She—had nearly asked him to stay. But wouldn’t that put upon the [Bard]…that Wesle and the others had hired to perform for her?
She hung her head. She was bad at this. At being the target of gratitude. And it was a skill. Erin felt embarrassed. Ashamed. And still.
She looked around the fancy restaurant. This wasn’t where she wanted to be. She should have told them that. They loved it, the Players. This was big dreams and Hollywood. Erin…
Stood up. Just for a moment. She took a breath.

Ryoka Griffin stopped before she entered the back rooms to check on Erin. She needed Barelle to perform at the Solstice party! Unrelated to Erin…well, she’d be there…whatever! He seemed used to the request.
“The [Emperor]? Certainly, Miss Griffin. We’ll talk, shall we? But I do need to get up on stage before Miss Emme hamstrings me—”
Ryoka pushed into the back room. Yes! Also, Barelle was definitely onto Xrn. He’d kept away from her the entire time. He seemed more curious of Numbtongue and vice versa. She hoped it wouldn’t come to anything.
But this was a party and Xrn—Ryoka pushed into the back room. She looked around. Then she swore.
“Erin—?”
Predictably, the [Innkeeper] was already gone. The back door was ajar. And Ryoka Griffin suddenly had a problem.

Erin Solstice was just going for a little walk, really. She knew it was bad—but she had to leave. She could predict her friends flooding in to check on her. She just—needed to step outside.
There were [Guards] outside the inn. No, [Bodyguards]. Including…
“Redit?”
The [Bouncer] turned.
“Miss Solstice? Everything okay?”
