Interlude – Two Rats

The others nodded. Tkrn took up his post outside the prison. And the rest went in. Mrsha couldn’t hear or see what they were doing. But she had to know. So she crept forwards. Tkrn was muttering to himself, under his breath. He seemed conflicted. He barely smelled Mrsha until she was right up on him. Then he jumped.
“Who—Mrsha?”
He stared down at her. The little Gnoll looked wide-eyed up at him. Tkrn stared. Then he looked at the prison.
“How did you get—did you hear—go away. Go back to Krshia. Or the inn! Shoo!”
He motioned her back with the butt of his spear. But Mrsha was close now. The door to the prison was iron, but she could hear sounds coming from within; it wasn’t fully closed. The sounds of voices. And something hitting something else. She narrowed her eyes. Tkrn hesitated.
“I’m warning—”
Too late. Mrsha jumped forwards on all fours. She raced through the door, pushing it open. Tkrn cursed and grabbed, but he was cumbersome in his armor. Mrsha ran into the prison. Rows of silent cells, mostly empty greeted her. Two prisoners stared out. A Gnoll and a Drake. The Gnoll was baring his teeth. The Drake listening in silence.
And at the far end was his cell. And him. Mrsha stopped as the Drake and Gnolls turned. She saw one of them lower the butt of the spear, whirl.
“Tkrn! I told you—”
The Gnoll snarled. Then he saw Mrsha and stopped. He took a step back with two of the Gnolls.
“Doombringer?”
“It’s just Mrsha! She slipped by me—”
Tkrn raced after Masha, panting. He caught her, but one of the Drakes made an agonized sound.
“You idiot, Tkrn! Just a kid? She’s seen us!”
And Mrsha did see. She saw a Minotaur, pulling himself upright. His broad nose was bloody. And his fur dislodged. And he was being struck.
By the spears. A pair of [Guards] held them. They were jabbing them into the cell, using the blunt ends. There wasn’t much Calruz could have done to stop them if he’d tried. But he hadn’t. He’d been standing still. Now they lowered the spears. Tkrn turned pale.
“I’ll take her out. Mrsha, you can’t tell anyone. You didn’t see this. Understand?”
He tried to pull Mrsha back. But one of the Gnolls, the one with the stripe, holding the spear, stopped her. He looked down.
“Wait. She was there.”
The others looked at Mrsha. She stared at the Gnoll [Guardsman]. And then at the Minotaur. She shrank back. But the Gnoll just raised his spear and jabbed it into the cell. Reflexively, Calruz twisted, but the spear struck him in the chest. He barely moved. Just grunted. But Mrsha knew it had to hurt.
“See?”
The Gnoll turned to her, his teeth bared. He gestured. Mrsha saw the Drake turn. She was panting. Her eyes were locked on Calruz’s. And she smelled of hate.
“We’re punishing him. We should have done it long ago. Only, the Watch Captain keeps visiting. But we’ve had enough. Lism is right. Election or not, we’ll make sure this thing doesn’t sit happily in here, eating and shitting while we clean up after him. He’ll pay. My brother was one of the ones the Raskghar sacrificed. Everyone here knows someone who was taken. And you were there.”
The Gnoll looked down at Mrsha. Tkrn was frozen. And the worried Drake looked at him.
“Ulkel! Don’t tell her—”
“Shut up, Paiss. She gets it. She was there. You think I’m right, don’t you?”
The Gnoll squatted down. Mrsha backed up. But then she turned her head. Calruz stood in his cell. He stared at her, his blue eyes calm. Unwavering. And she recognized him at the same time he recognized her.
