“Liscor paid us for the inn. We got money from the Creler attack, you have money saved up even with taxes—but I’m counting on some good business to finish funding the inn. I’ve even got plans for other wings, but we’re finishing up the guest rooms. I’m hoping we can have more Gold-rank teams here.”
Erin slowly gulped down her milk. Her mind was spinning. Lyonette looked at her.
“Now, tell us about the battle.”
“What? Oh—that was—I stayed out of the fighting. I didn’t expect Bird to be there. And it wasn’t my fault! I think. But I stayed out of trouble. Completely.”
“We saw you.”
Lyonette stared at the young woman. Erin faltered.
“Oh?”
“Saw the fighting. Nice flaming things. And knife.”
The [Bard] nodded at Erin. The [Innkeeper] slapped a hand to her forehead.
“Aw. I lost the knife Pelt gave me. I’m gonna have to see if someone found it.”
“Erin.”
The [Princess] and the [Innkeeper] traded looks. Erin paused and sighed.
“Well, I had to do something. And I was safe. Rufelt and Lasica were the insane ones, believe it or not. Did you know? I think Lasica’s pregnant—”
“What?”
Lyonette stared at Erin. But then she shook her head.
“But Erin. What do we do now? About…”
She nodded covertly. Everyone turned their heads. They all stared at Bird. Erin’s stomach fell.
“I don’t know. It wasn’t that…”
She couldn’t even finish the lie. Mrsha looked up worriedly at Erin. The young woman hugged her with one arm.
“It’ll be alright. Olesm and the Council and Zevara—we’ll deal with whatever happened. We can explain.”
“Or not. But that’s not what I’m talking about, Erin. It’s not the consequences for us. It’s about him.”
“Oh. But—”

Bird was happy. He sat in his chair, eating the wing of the big bird. He kept thinking that if it was the right wing, maybe he’d grow them too. He’d seen the Flying Antinium. Pivr. So Bird knew it was possible.
He was happy. He had been hit! But healed. Klbkch was very angry, but Bird was not dead. So that was a win. The Worker was wondering about all the big birds in Pallass. He’d wanted to pick them up somehow, but they’d told him to go, and so had Erin. But maybe, tonight, when no one was looking…
The [Hunter] looked up as Lyonette and Erin walked over. They were looking grave, but Bird was happy. He waved three of his hands at them. It was nice to have hands again.
“Bird.”
“That is me. Hello. I am glad you are done with your break, Miss Erin. And I shot many big birds. Did you see me?”
The shorter of the two young women hesitated. Lyonette was a bit taller than Erin, for all she was two years younger. Erin shot a quick look at Lyonette and then nodded slowly.
“Yes we did. Bird—are you hurt?”
She indicated Bird’s head. The Worker felt at it.
“My head is not hurting much. And I stopped bleeding. See? It is not bad at all.”
Erin had even wiped away the blood. The [Innkeeper] nodded, relieved. She looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] nudged her. They gave each other a look that Bird ignored—he was trying to figure out how to bite off more of the Wyvern’s wing. Erin sighed.
“Bird, we need to talk. Um. Let’s go to your room, okay?”
“Yes, Erin.”
Bird stood up obediently. He began to trundle over to the stairs. The newly-built inn had two stairwells on opposite ends that would lead up to the second floor. Right now, only a third of the second floor was done, though, so one stairwell was blocked off. Erin stopped Bird.
“You have to leave the…wing, Bird.”
The Worker started. He looked down at the half-eaten Wyvern wing.
“But it is mine. I must imbibe nutrients.”
“Just leave it, Bird. We need to talk.”
