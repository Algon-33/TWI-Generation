Erin Solstice slowly leaned on the counter of her bar, in her inn. It wasn’t that Saliss was funny that made her like him. Or that he was strong, or kind. Or even his quirks which did not resemble her that much. No, she had met other people who were just as brave or strong, or kind.
No, what spoke to Erin was something else. A familiarity that she had felt. That she had seen through him and he through her. A…sense that there was an inner-Saliss, carefully watching him laugh and dance about in the nude.
Like a little Erin, who was sometimes genuinely forgetful, or random or silly. But sometimes calculated. But where that inner-Saliss—or inner-Erin began to calculate and where they were genuine, you’d never know. Not even them.
But what she saw in the inner-Saliss and the outer was something familiar. A strange, crazy thing in a person in this world. A desire to help people. Without getting something in return all the time. To make someone’s life better. To reach out and grab a flailing hand.
To not be a jerk.
Kindred spirits. Erin wondered if it was just her imagination. By her side, Lyonette exhaled.
“You would like him. He’s a bit like you, I suppose. Maybe. But please tell me you won’t strip and walk around nude.”
“Mrsha does it.”
“…True. We really need to buy her pants.”
Mrsha looked up as the two young women stared down at her. She folded her arms.
You and what armies?
