Interlude – Hectval (Pt. 2)

Not for Heaven. Not for the condemnation of his foes. Certainly not for the forgiveness of sins. He prayed for something else.
And the world answered him.
 
 
 
 
Lulv, [Spearmaster]
 
The Painted Antinium were gathered up on the hill as the [Spearmaster] watched the last push begin. The [Strategist]—no, the [Commander]—had done his best.
He had placed Dekass and that other Worker behind their lines. However, he couldn’t hide them. Manus had struck their camp. Olesm had managed to threaten the skies—even down a Wyvern, damn him.
But the Painted Antinium died. Forty, counting the reinforcements, were making a final stand. No [Fireball] targets unfortunately; [Mages] were blowing every spell out of the air.
Lulv himself was watching his forces press in. He was waiting for a final trick, a teleportation spell. That was how he saw the Antinium.
“No class. Just like the others.”
One of his [Mages] pointed it out as it charged into Hectval’s lines from the side. Lulv turned his head. He frowned.
“I know that one.”
The other Drakes and Gnolls looked around. Lulv had thought it was dead, but there was no mistake.
Of all the Antinium fighting, even the squad rallied around the Minotaur with the axe, none of them were that…graceful with a sword.
It was no [Blade Dancer], but the sword parried a Drake, slipped through a gap, and sliced through bone. A single Soldier. No Painted Antinium.
“Mark it. Kill it.”
A dozen [Archers] pivoted and one gasped. Lulv turned and snarled.
“The [Sniper]!”
An arrow protruded from a chest. It was all chest-shots now. Lulv roared, searching around for it.
“Kill it and this time burn it to make sure it’s dead!”
A kill-team raced off, and Lulv turned back to see the Soldier swing his sword and chop a Drake in half.
“Strong.”
One of the officers muttered. He had a blade from Manus’ armories. Even so…was that [Greater Strength]? Lulv would never know; something about these Antinium meant you couldn’t read their classes.
“Alright, kill it. Loose!”
Eleven arrows shot at the Antinum. It was good; it ducked, but three curved and struck it. Deep wounds along the chest and stomach. It staggered…and seemed to look up at Lulv.
The [Spearmaster] saw the [Archers] nocked another arrow. He almost felt bad for it. A good warrior. But that was all. He was a Level 43 [Spearmaster]. It was probably Level 20 at best, a Painted Antinium-quality [Soldier].
If it had two dozen years…or just ten…? That was his job, to make sure they never got them. Especially the ones like that Worker trying to heal and failing.
The Alliance’s [Soldiers] charged, surrounding the Soldier and fouling Manus’ shots, the idiots. Lulv watched. One stabbed the Soldier in the side. He beheaded the Drake, whirled the sword up, stabbed a Gnoll through the chest, swept it through a spear, brought it down on a helmet—his shield deflecting a maul and axe.
“Dead gods, that one’s not bad.”
“Yep. If you have a [Guaranteed Shot]—loose!”
Carefully, two arrows flew. Leg hit, shoulder. The Soldier was bleeding, now. Staggering as the Alliance’s [Soldiers] hung back.
Yet it continued. Lulv had seen that, too. Heroes who kept fighting even when stabbed through the heart.
“Get me a javelin.”
He was going to end its suffering. Lulv grabbed the javelin impatiently and turned. He drew back—the Soldier looked up at him, and the [Spearmaster] threw.
The spear had such velocity that it punched through the Antinium’s left shoulder. It had partially dodged.
“Good shot, Commander.”
