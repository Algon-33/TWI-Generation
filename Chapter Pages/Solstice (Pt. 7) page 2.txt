He gestured at…Ryoka stared at the sword. The stone. She glanced over her shoulder. Nama’s battle against the Wild Hunt seemed far away. Each cry stretching out until she stood in a moment between such things.
“Oh no. This can’t be happening.”
She looked at the three-in-one. The sword. The oldest man with the broken crown raised his brows.
“What can’t be happening? Come, traveller. And tell us why the Winter Court hunts you so.”
He beckoned. Ryoka approached, staring, eyes wide. She stared at the boy. He waved at her. The young man looked her up and down. Then he did a double-take.
“…Are your feet bared? What curious customs some people have.”
Of all the—Ryoka gazed at him. Then she looked at the stone.
“No way. Just to be clear—hi. My name’s Ryoka.”
She was panting. She switched through her layers of reality. Mundanity, epic—even horror and despondence. She had the trick of it, now. Each one revealed nothing different.
Sword. Stone. The three. The boy held out a hand.
“Hello. We’re pleased to meet you.”
Ryoka hesitated. She shook the hand, very gingerly, prepared for it to turn into…
It was just a soft grip, soft in nature, the boy’s hands callused by work. The other two instantly held out hands.
“I apologize for my appearance.”
The eldest of them indicated his armor and wounds. Ryoka stared at him.
“Just to be clear. I’m a mortal. I’m just passing through. I—I’m being hunted.”
“You will be, the moment you leave this place.”
The young man nodded amiably. His eyes looked Ryoka up and down.
“Bared feet. But you are mortal, aren’t you? Strange. Few of your kind ever walk here.”
“That’s what everyone says. Look—please don’t mess with me. I’ve been having a bad day. You’re not King Arthur of Camelot, right? Right?”
Ryoka stared at the sword in the stone. She looked up—and the two men bowed.
“I am King Arthur.”
“I am King Arthur.”
“I’m just Arthur.”
The boy offered. Ryoka covered her face slowly.
“No you’re not. This is silly. It’s gone too far. That’s not Excalibur. I’ve gone mad. I drank too much and this is a fever dream.”
The three looked at each other.
“Why is it not? And that isn’t Excalibur.”
“Oh, g—”
“That’s Caliburn. I will wield Excalibur when Caliburn breaks. I prefer this sword. I will have it in my glory, not my fading days.”
The young man pointed at the sword. Ryoka stared at him. Arthur smiled, looking excited for the future. The old King found a seat on the grass.
“It will last a while. But the worst is yet to come.”
The boy and the young man nodded to each other. Ryoka looked around.
“I don’t understand what’s happening.”
“Sit, sit milady Griffin. Time will not bother you here. It does not us.”
Like a knight, the young man and boy refused to sit until she did. Ryoka did, staring at the blade.
“Why are there three of you? What is this?”
“The sword in the stone. Where it always is. I have yet to pick it up. Or rather, I have. I just haven’t pulled it from the stone.”
The boy informed Ryoka, licking his lips nervously. He looked about.
“You see, I needed a sword for my brother who broke his. But I could only find this one. And Merlin—”
“Bastard. He tricked us.”
The old man muttered. Ryoka nearly spat out the stamina potion onto the younger King Arthur. He politely offered her a handkerchief.
“—He told me to take this sword. So I did. Now I’m here.”
“I lost my sword in battle. This was the moment before I returned the blade to the Lady of the Lake for the second blade. Did you say ‘Excalibur’?”
The young man was interested. The old man nodded.
