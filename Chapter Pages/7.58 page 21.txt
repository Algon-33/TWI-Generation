Someone was fighting past the barriers. Jelaqua Ivirith was Rampaging, tossing the [Assassins] around with every swing of her flail in her Raskghar’s form. But Wailant saw a figure step out of one of the dying [Assassin]’s shadows. He carried a longsword. And as Jelaqua twisted—
Snick. Her head fell off. The slice was that fast. Her body staggered, began swinging the flail in every direction. Selphid. But the [Assassin] was already stepping out of a shadow well out of range. And this was the sewers. Shadows were everywhere.
“That’s a Face.”
The [Mages], Runners, and others stopped fighting for a moment as Jelaqua slowed. The [Shadowmaster Assassin] stepped forwards. He pointed his sword at the group.
“[Beheading Slice]. Give up before someone actually dies. You don’t want this to go further and we don’t want to waste Skills and bodies on you.”
The others looked at each other. That one could go straight through the barriers. Wailant grabbed Viceria’s arm. Teleport. She pointed.
Garia was breathing hard, covering Fals—she’d knocked several [Assassins] into the sewer’s sludge with punches and kicks, but she wasn’t prepared for this. It was supposed to be a diversion.
“What do we do? Salamani?”
The [Mage] was aiming his wand at the largest group of [Assassins].
“Ryoka’s group might have been ambushed. You. [Assassin]. We’ll walk away if you do—”
“No. Surrender and we guarantee you won’t be harmed. But you won’t interfere. By the Guild, I promise that.”
“You trust their word?”
Montressa hissed. Wailant looked behind them.
“We’re surrounded, Mage Montressa. We might have to trust it.”
More shadows from the other side. The others wavered. Seborn spat.
“They’re going to shadow-step in. I can’t stop them all. It’ll be a massacre. Throw down your weapons. Unless you can stop that?”
“I can try—but it’s an advanced—”
The [Assassin] was losing his patience.
“There will be no second quarter. I said—”
Thump. The sewers shook. Wailant saw mortar and stone shifting, dust and muck showering down. Everyone tensed.
“What in the depths was that?”
The [Shadowmaster Assassin] didn’t know either. He gestured to one of the others.
“Find out what that was. The rest of you—”
Thwoom. Or—some other sound. Wailant didn’t really know. He went deaf as the street imploded above the [Assassins], showering them with rubble and masonry. The surface collapsed into the sewers!
The faster [Assassins] escaped, jumping away, using Skills—but a quarter of them went down with screams. The [Shadowmaster] leapt out of another shadow.
“What was th—”
“[Flurry Blades].”
Seborn emerged from his shadow. The [Shadowmaster] screamed as the [Rogue] slashed him four times. He vanished and reappeared, away from Seborn.
“Kill th—”
“Loose!”
He jerked. Wailant saw a shower of fletched bolts appear in the [Shadowmaster]. The Face dropped without a sound. Seborn recoiled. Everyone fell silent.
They looked up. The other [Assassins] stared upwards as the voice shouted again.
“Reload. Aim. Volley!”
A second flight of arrows. The [Assassins] dove for cover. Wailant stared up through the clouds of dust. What in the name of Selphid’s tits was going on up—
Then he saw the first Drake [Crossbowman], kneeling in rank formation. And the blue-scaled Drake pointing downwards.
“Olesm?”
Palt’s cigar dropped out of his mouth. Why was he—?

Something was happening. Bethal had watched the standoff and the Drake—Saliss of Lights—telling jokes for nearly two hours. Well, not directly. The two [Commentators] were talking about the standoff. It seemed like Saliss’ cure would go to waste despite it all.
