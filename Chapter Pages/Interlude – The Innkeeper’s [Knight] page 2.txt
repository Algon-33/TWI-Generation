Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 2
The [Soldiers] disarmed them, as the [Knights] tossed their weapons down and knelt, raising their arms. More began to surrender.
One kept fighting. He was the [Knight] in plain armor. He’d already downed three [Soldiers] despite them fighting in groups, using potions and falling back. He’d seized a short spear and was using it while holding a dagger in the other hand.
He didn’t fight…like a [Knight]. Not setting himself, using his sword and shield and holding ground. Rather, he lunged into combat, willing to grapple and stab his opponents at point-blank range. Retreat, pivot—if anything the armor seemed to slow down his natural fighting style.
“There’s a brawler. Back up! Back up, you idiots!”
The [General] saw the [Knight] spin. The other Order of Seasons [Knights] were calling out, but he wasn’t listening.
“Ser Solstice! Lower your blade! Ser Solstice!”
The foreign [Knight] turned. He saw the [General] coming at him. The helmeted visor portrayed nothing of the man inside. But perhaps—was there a crimson glint? Certainly, a cold stare seemed to emanate from the visor.
The [General] grinned. He charged—and Ser Solstice, known to some as the Goblin Slayer, moved to meet him. He brought up the spear—then dropped it in a feint.
[Grand Slash]!
It was just a dagger, but suddenly it had an arc as wide as a greatsword’s! And the force! The [General] reared backwards.
“Shit—[Rolling—]”
He rolled under the blade, suddenly agile as a fox. The [Knight] caught himself as the [General] came up. He had a dagger—but he’d seen how strong the man was. So he spun—
An armored foot caught the [General] in the face. The man staggered—and an armored gauntlet crashed into his nose. Then came the dagger, stabbing in the side. Ser Solstice was a blur of blows. He raised his fist, aiming a finger at the man’s eye—
The [General] caught the fist. He twisted, but the [Knight] refused to give up. Even as he moved, he stabbed again, going for the man’s neck—
The huge head came down in a head-butt that the [First Mate] heard from dozens of paces away. The impact made everyone wince.
A metal divot in the [Knight]’s helmet. Yet still—he struggled, despite the probable concussion. He went for a punch—and the [General] let go and punched as well.
Both fists connected. The [General] didn’t even blink at the blow to his shoulder.
The [Knight] lay on the ground, motionless.
“Tough bastard. Anyone recognize his armor?”
The [General] kicked him onto his back as the [Soldiers] advanced. The others were surrendered or being tended to. Some scratched their heads.
“Dunno, [General]. ‘Es got no insignia. Balls like an ox to challenge you, though. Rest are Season’s lot. You want we should kick the crap out of them?”
“Nah. Just tie ‘em up again and don’t let them get a hand on a blade, you idiots!”
The [General] cursed. He caught sight of the naval officers and sighed.
“Here’s more salt-sucking worms. See to it!”
He stormed off as the [Knights] were taken into custody. This time they were being stripped of their armor—at least their helmets. They’d just arrived in the war camp, off The Narwhal’s Bow, and had launched their desperate escape attempt with a stolen knife. A [Soldier] bent for the unknown [Knight]’s helmet—
“Stop!”
The authoritative tone from one of the [Spring Knights] made the man hesitate.
“What’s the problem?”
“Don’t remove his helmet. That [Knight] is the Goblin Slayer of Izril! Ser Solstice! He’s sworn an oath never to remove his helm!”
One of the Order of Seasons’ [Knights] barked. The [Soldier] scoffed. He reached for the helmet—
