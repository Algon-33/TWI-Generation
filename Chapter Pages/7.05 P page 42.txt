“[Witches] do not run from their pain, Emperor Godart. She cannot run from this forever. It will catch up to her slowly, in years and decades perhaps, but this is a battle she must fight.”
Hedag nodded, in perfect agreement. Laken sighed.
“What does she need, then?”
“Time.”
The answer came from both [Witches]. It felt…insufficient. Laken shook his head. Time? For a daughter who had watched…
Witch Califor.
The statue was still not finished. What could you add to it? Witch Califor, who died for us? Witch Califor, who moved fire to save a village? Witch Califor, Mother to Nanette.
Who was forced to die so that Belavierr’s daughter might live. Laken could sense Wiskeria standing still. Still as stone. What could you say?
Nothing. And Nanette? Not a word at all. So Laken just nodded.
“Of course. Keep her safe, Witch Eloise, Witch Hedag. Some in Riverfarm are still…prejudiced. After all they’ve seen.”
“And what should we keep her safe from, your Majesty? People? She will walk among them all her days. If she remains a [Witch].”
A cool reply from Hedag. Laken shook his head. He valued their words. But it was exceptionally hard to argue with a [Witch].
“Go, Prost. Go, all of you. If you want to deal with the Goblins, take it into your own hands.”
And I hope you all get splinters.
The [Emperor] sighed. But at least it was better than death.
 
 
Day of Laughter
 
The Goblins waited through the night for the Humans to attack. But they never did. There was shouting in the night, and Humans with bows came close to the border. The Redfangs ordered all the Goblins who couldn’t fight to fall back. They were prepared to fight if arrows came out of the forests.
But they never did. The certain-death never came, and it would have been certain death. Pebblesnatch could count how many Humans there were. And yet, the attack never came. The watchful Goblins waited, as the injured [Thief] moaned as Ulvama packed an ointment into her wound and bandaged it. The [Shaman] was worried. Even though she’d encouraged the stealing!
“How else?”
She looked blank when Pebblesnatch angrily confronted her. The [Shaman] swept a hand around the Goblin’s territory. Full of things to eat—but not crops. Not eggs, or animals. How else would they get the food she wanted? That Pebblesnatch made?
Not like that! Pebblesnatch glared. What about what that angry Human had said? Trading? Ulvama scowled.
“Don’t trust Humans. They hate us. Hate you. Hate me.”
She poked Pebblesnatch. This was a fact. Pebblesnatch swatted her hand down, furiously.
“Not all bad!”
She thought of Erin. Who was so kind. Ulvama snorted. She turned away.
“Because you are small. Me? They are not kind to me. Or other Goblins who have what they want. Do not be stupid.”
She sat moodily, with her back facing Pebblesnatch. And her posture radiated…Pebblesnatch faltered. She walked back out of the hut. She thought that for once, if she’d argued, Ulvama would have actually hit her.
Leafarmor explained what Ulvama had meant. Pebblesnatch’s eyes widened as Leafarmor explained. The Hobgoblin grinned. But it wasn’t a smile.
“Lots of Humans. Redfangs who get captured. Female. Nearly happened to me.”
“Did?”
The Hobgoblin laughed.
“No. Redfangs killed them. Humans take off pants! Easy to stab!”
She laughed, and some of the other Redfangs laughed too. Pebblesnatch nodded. Leafarmor grew pensive.
“Goblins die either way. Just die later. Chance. You wait and then stab. Or wait and maybe live. Ulvama lived. If Humans attack—might live again. I? I would rather kill.”
