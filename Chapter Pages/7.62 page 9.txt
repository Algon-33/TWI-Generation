A [Cleric]. But she had seen the Antinium fail.
“She’s not dead, though.”
“She is.”
The [Lady] shook her head. Rose raised a trembling finger.
“You don’t know how biology works. She’s not entirely—”
“She’s dead.”
Saliss of Lights put down his fist on the table. The plates jumped. And the inn went silent.
The [Alchemist] looked about. And his eyes held some of that ruthless mercy that Garry had shown.
“Want me to prove it?”
He looked around. Kevin stared at the Drake. In a corner of the inn, Ylawes’ head rose.
They had all heard it. The desperate refrain. Erin isn’t dead. Cryostasis. Maviola, on hearing it, just shook her head. It sounded like what [Soldiers] said of fallen comrades. How would you bring her back? If you were alive—you’d have to cure the poison and then apply a potion.
But Erin wasn’t breathing. Her heart had stopped. And to add to that, her flesh was now ice. There was nothing to bring back, at least, to Maviola’s understanding.
And there was one more thing. The [Alchemist] looked around.
“[Mage].”
He pointed at Montressa. The young woman looked at him.
“What?”
“Cast a spell. I know you know it. Cast the spell. And you—I can see it. So can you. Can’t you?”
He looked at Maviola. She nodded. Montressa’s lips moved.
“What spell?”
“[Detect Life].”
The inn went silent. Rose faltered. Saliss looked at Montressa. The [Mage] made no move.
“Don’t need to? Or have you already tried? There is nothing there.”
Maviola nodded. She saw Lyonette’s eyes swing towards her.
“I’m sorry.”
“No, you see—science—”
There was no spark of life. Maviola saw it differently than Saliss. And she had seen…nothing. No spark. Not even the faintest ember. Nothing. Magic—Skills—both thought Erin was dead.
She was dead.
“You couldn’t put your boon on her, at the end, could you, Lyonette?”
“No. No—I tried. I thought—”
“The dying cannot be given a boon of life. Nor can the dead. The only Skills that work on dead bodies are those that belong to those who command inanimate objects.”
Silence. Rose tried to say something. Kevin slowly sat down. He put his head in his hands. Maviola El felt tears coming again.
Children. How they’d hoped. She didn’t blame them. But they had to know. Even Mrsha. The longer they hoped, the more it would tear them apart to say goodbye.
“It can’t be. But—”
“You must say goodbye. Before…the dead rise.”
Lyonette jerked. Maviola shuddered. A sound rose in the inn, a wail. A Gnoll howled and others took up the sound.
“But—but—”
Maviola shook her head. She looked at Rose, at the others, gently, but firmly.
“I buried my brother, Fulviolo of the House of El. Tyrion Veltras buried his wife. The King of Destruction lost two—three of his Seven. Great men and women, [Kings] and [Queens], Dragons and heroes have lost their loved ones. How many came back? They would have moved the entire world for them. But they could not overturn death. I’m sorry. But this is the truth.”
She bowed her head. And the ghost stirred. He looked up, raising his head. His clawed hand touched the hole in his chest. His wounds that showed how he had died. Then he stood—remembering his body in life. He walked past them.
“The world is empty. Empty—ending. Let it all end.”
The [Priest] was shaking. The ghost stopped for a moment, looking. Listening to the undeniable proof. He walked towards the walls of the inn. And he spoke.
“No. Not yet.”
Pawn’s head rose. He looked around for the voice.
