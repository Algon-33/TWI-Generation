“Ah, of course. You didn’t say. We should have celebrated. Which is why I heard about the celebration in the inn. Congratulations.”
“It was right after the Creler attack. Not a time to celebrate. But thank you.”
Both women looked at each other, Lyonette with her faint smile—Zevara not even going to false pretenses. It was a game both enjoyed. The Drake’s lips twitched a bit.
“Fine. But what precipitated you reaching…”
“Level 18.”
“Huh. I’d imagine that’s good for a [Baroness], right?”
This time Lyonette was ready. She didn’t move.
“Hm?”
“Nothing. So? The precipitating factor?”
“Oh. Um…nothing much.”
Lyonette’s hesitation made Zevara look up sharply. She narrowed her eyes.
“Really. Nothing?”
“…Do you want to know?”
The Drake’s eyelids flickered. She wasn’t an idiot. She opened and closed her mouth.
“Hm. That would imply…no. Wait. But…”
Lyonette found herself turning red as Zevara looked her up and down. The Drake was a bit drunk, but she had constitution Skills. She bit into a tart as she thought.
“That implies…but who are you seeing? It wouldn’t be…wait…didn’t you once hint that…”
“Zevara, it’s really—”
The Drake’s eyes widened. She choked on her tart.
“The Antin—Pawn?”
She looked at Lyonette. Zevara exhaled a bit of fire, cooking the tart. She coughed as Lyonette spoke.
“Look, what happened was—”
“Stop. I don’t want to know. Stop. Right there. Don’t tell me. Don’t make excuses. I don’t want to…wait. I thought—”
“Actually…”
Zevara looked at Lyonette. She wavered between curiosity and…
“No. Don’t tell me. Ancestors.”
Her reaction made Lyonette a bit angry. The [Princess] cleared her throat, suppressing her blush.
“You know, it’s not something I’m ashamed of.”
“Of course not. How did Miss Solstice take it?”
“Er…”
“Mhm. Don’t tell me she—”
“No. She’s actually against it in general. Sex, that is.”
Zevara actually laughed as she went to fill up her cup. She was doing it drip by drip, seeming to be trying to avoid from filling it up that high.
“Now that’s funny! For someone as open-minded as her, well…good for you. I suppose it’s not that odd. Klbkch has been propositioned more than once, you know.”
“Really?”
“Yup. Well, not recently. But he’s been here a decade and people still remember him fighting off the Necromancer. He’s intelligent, wealthy, a Senior Guardsman—and, well, the insect thing didn’t put off some Drakes and Gnolls. But still. He doesn’t have…don’t tell me he’s an exception…? Why are you making me ask this?”
“Actually, you can solve that with some of Krshia’s, uh, special goods. Do you know about…? Zevara…?”
The Firebreath Whiskey was overflowing onto the table. The Drake stared at Lyonette. Then she put the bottle back up, stared at the bottle. She shoved herself back from the desk.
“I’m leaving.”
“Zevara!”
The Drake wasn’t kidding. She walked out of her office, shaking her head. She headed down the stairs and Lyonette chased after her.
It wasn’t just theatrics. Zevara strode past the desk and into the Watch’s training yard. Lyonette, following, saw the Drake stalking past groups of training Watch recruits. Mostly Drakes and Gnolls, but some Humans were noticeably among the ranks of the rookies.
“Watch Captain present! Salute!”
The Drake on duty was Jeiss. The Councilman was also a Senior Guardsman and even if he had his other job interfering with his patrols, he could certainly teach. He was considered the best bladesman in the Watch—aside from maybe Klbkch and Zevara herself. Zevara waved a claw.
“At ease. I’m just here to train. How’re the recruits?”
