She stared into the fire. It crackled, the wood collapsing and the embers burning low. But neither she nor Pyrite made any effort to refuel it. They would have to run again tomorrow, as soon as they rose. Rags stared at her shortsword.
“Running. Fourth day tomorrow.”
“Mm.”
“Can’t do forever. Humans bringing us somewhere. But tribe will die before then. Animals already dying. Ate half of them today.”
“And food. Less to carry.”
“Less to eat.”
“Can’t fix now.”
“No.”
Rags shook her head. She looked at the fire and her sword. She glanced up. Something. There had to be something. She thought of her memory of Velan. And like that she had a plan. Another plan. Rags sat up, her eyes widening. But then she sagged.
It was a bad plan. Or rather, it wouldn’t change things. It might make things worse, actually. But it was all she had. They could keep running or they could fight. That was their only option. She didn’t know which would be better. Running meant they’d slowly die. But she’d fought before. She’d burned the Human’s lands, killed them, broken an army. And it had been for nothing.
“Pyrite.”
The Hob looked up. Rags stared at him.
“What?”
“Have a plan.”
His ears perked up.
“Really?”
Rags smiled wearily.
“I am your Chieftain. I always have plan.”
“Will it save tribe? Get rid of Humans?”
The Goblin hesitated and then shook her head.
“No. Not enough. Hurt them. Make them mad. Should do? Or…keep running?”
Pyrite hesitated. He fell silent and stared into the fire. When he looked up he shrugged.
“Don’t know, Chieftain. Could make things worse. Could make things better. Don’t know. But trust you to do right thing.”
“What? Why?”
Rags scowled at Pyrite. All her plans had backfired! She’d gotten her tribe killed! Pyrite looked at Rags calmly.
“Because Chieftain is smart. Tribe still follows. So Chieftain think and decide. And we follow. For better or worse, Chieftain Rags. Show us smart thing. Show us hope.”
“Hope? What hope? There is no hope!”
Rags leapt up. She grabbed at her head as Pyrite looked at her, raising her voice despite the late hour.
“Goblins die! Tribe is running! Humans chase us! We run—and die—and run and die! Again and again! Ever since I lead!”
“But we are here. Because of you. Because you had ideas. Because you didn’t give up.”
“I only did stupid things!”
“But no one else did them.”
Pyrite pointed at Rags. He stood slowly, grunting with effort. He looked down at Rags. And when he spoke, his voice was measured. Calm.
“When I was alone, I did not know how to lead the tribe. When you woke I was relieved. You had the plan that beat the Humans. You defeated the [Emperor]. And when the other Humans came, when they cheated, you were the one who led us away.”
He pointed at Rags.
“You, Chieftain. We could not do it. Quietstab could not. Poisonbite could not. Noears could not. Redscar could not. I could not. But you did. You keep trying. You have plans where we do not. That is why we follow. For hope. Because you see what we can’t. Show us it again. Show us something that will surprise everyone.”
He stared down at Rags. The small Goblin blinked up at him, stunned. Pyrite bowed his head. Then he sat. He lay on his back. He went to sleep there and then as Rags stood, paralyzed by a strange feeling in her chest. She stared at Pyrite as the Hob began to snore.
Pyrite trusted her. Even now. Even after—
Rags looked at her hand. Her fingers like claws. Dirty, small. But hers. She closed them slowly. Then Rags looked around her camp.
