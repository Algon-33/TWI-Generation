Author’s Note: Them’s lots of words.
Not as many words as last time, but…am I gaining in word count even now? It feels so, but surely the hard-stop is my arms. Well, I do have a lot more management techniques, but there is such a thing as too many words.
Then again, for big chapters, you need lots of words. This wasn’t one chapter, but it is advancement. That’s Volume 8, I guess.
I hope you enjoyed it. I’m not sure what chapter comes next. I guess I’ll figure it out~
Nah, there’s only two it could be. Two good chapters, hopefully. I’ll see you then. For now, thanks for reading!
