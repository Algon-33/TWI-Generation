Solstice (Pt. 1)

The City Runner nearly kissed the shrimp as someone slammed into her then seized her in a hug.
Dustrider Charlay hugged the Wind Runner. Alevica and Delanay were also in tow, mainly swept up in Charlay’s good mood.
“Charlay?”
Ryoka blinked. Charlay was beaming.
“It’s so good to see you! I thought you were dead! I was trying to help and I fought [Assassins]! And leveled up! You should have seen me—and Alevica helped out! I knew she had a good heart! Actually, I thought she was evil, but—”
“Let go of Ryoka, Charlay.”
Alevica stabbed Charlay in the side with a wand. The Centaur did. Ryoka stood, swaying a bit, and saw the [Witch].
“So you made it.”
“Yes. Hello, Alevica. Thanks for…everything.”
The [Witch] eyed Ryoka.
“You look like you’re still dead. And you look like you’re about to rip your heart out. Good thing Belavierr isn’t here.”
Ryoka jerked at the name. Alevica saw her emotions as clearly as…Charlay’s face fell.
“Oh. Someone said that you um, lost someone. Are you okay, Ryoka?”
“No.”
“Ah.”
The Centauress hesitated, dancing on her hooves. She didn’t know. The somber Emergency Runner on the other hand—Ryoka blinked.
“Delanay? You came?”
The young man tipped his hat to her.
“House d’Artien received an invitation. I thought it was only fitting…and I thought we’d meet. I forgot you knew Dusty Charlay.”
“I’ll kick you, Delanay!”
Charlay adjusted her back hooves, scowling. Delanay moved out of the way.
“And you know the Witch Runner. A number of the interesting City Runners, in short.”
“I didn’t know you knew the Hunter’s Guild’s brat, Ryoka.”
Alevica and Delanay stared at each other. No love lost between the descendant of [Witch Hunters] and [Vampire Hunters] and a [Witch] herself. Alevica smiled. Delanay tipped his hat.
“We don’t conduct witch hunts any more, Miss Alevica.”
“Witches have long memories. Delanay.”
“Do they remember why they were necessary?”
At any other time, Ryoka would have been worried. Trying to defuse the situation, or sweating bullets. Now? She was just looking around.
“Did Fierre come, Delanay?”
The wrong person to ask. The Emergency Runner shifted to look at Ryoka and his hand twitched.
“No. I have yet to meet her. We were all at the inn when…I’m sorry. I was inside, and I didn’t think to go outside. Miss Solstice had left the city on foot…”
Ryoka felt sick. She hadn’t known the details. And Delanay? He stopped, seeing her face.
“I apologize. I shouldn’t bring this up.”
Charlay looked from face to face, uncomprehending. Alevica just stared at Ryoka’s emotions, observing in her own way. Ryoka shook her head.
“No—no. I don’t know how…how did it happen?”
“Perhaps it’s better to say in some privacy. With…some drinks.”
Delanay glanced around at the merry faces, his expression somber. Ryoka nodded.
“I’ll uh, get drinks!”
Charlay raced off, all too eager to escape the conversation. Alevica just snorted. She looked at Ryoka.
“You actually pulled it off. I had to stick around and see. Incidentally—we’re square. Understand?”
“Yep. Thank you.”
“Well…good.”
The Witch Runner hesitated. She turned on her heel, as if to leave, and turned back abruptly.
“Have you spoken to Eloise? You might. She’s probably got a tea for you or something.”
“No. I’m waiting for the guests.”
Alevica and Delanay both looked at Ryoka. Neither one knew what she meant. But soon, Charlay was racing back with ales, and Delanay gestured to a table.
“…Why don’t we sit. And I’ll tell you what happened.”
Ryoka nodded. She drifted after Delanay. Someone else followed.
“Tell me, too.”
