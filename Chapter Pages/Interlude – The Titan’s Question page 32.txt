Interlude – The Titan’s Question
Page 32
“That’s an odd question. Of course you stand out! I’ve never had a student pop out of the ground covered in…sewer waste during my games! That was a surprise! You beat your fellow students!”
“Yes sir. But that was luck as much as strategy. I’m talking about me as a student.”
The Titan shrugged lightly. Umina watched him, her tail curled up.
“You’re gifted, sharp—you come up with the most unorthodox solutions most often, which is what I like to see. Of course you’re special!”
“Professor.”
The Fraerling paused. Umina looked at him and spoke slowly.
“I think you’re lying to me. Or—telling half-truths. I need to know. What if I made it my question, Professor? Honestly, am I unique?”
Niers looked at her. Really looked at Umina. And she felt a pit in her stomach. She’d admired him. She wanted to be like him. She’d tried her best to excel, to be worthy of the legend of her teacher. So she knew the answer when he covered up his reply with his praise. And she knew the answer before he spoke now.
“No.”
The word hit Umina like a brick. Niers sat up. He looked at her. A bit sadly.
“You did ask. And if you made it our question, Umina, I would say…no. Do you stand out? Yes. But are you…”
“Special?”
She looked at him. Niers shook his head slowly.
“I’m sorry. But if you’re asking if I see something I haven’t seen before? I don’t. I see a brilliant young [Strategist], Umina. But you have to understand. I taught Perorn, Umina. Perorn, Tulm—all of them. They were all my best students. And you know what? I didn’t even think they were the best at the time.”
“You didn’t?”
The Professor sat back. He looked backwards and shook his head.
“Some of them stood out, like Tulm. Most surprised me. I can remember students I thought would change the world, replace me, who died. Or just never became anything. Some of them were so gifted I couldn’t believe it. Others had special talents, Skills, classes. That made them ‘special’. If you want to know if I see that spark—”
He shook his head. Umina bit her lip. She wasn’t going to cry. Niers was speaking to her like an adult, not a child. He looked up, kindly, but seriously.
“I’m sorry to tell you like that. But if you were asking if I saw a great spark in you—I don’t. And overconfidence—”
“—Kills. I know, Professor.”
Did you have to ask? His gaze looked pained. Umina only dipped her head once. She’d wanted to know. It was a bitter truth. It had soured the moment. After a moment, Niers sighed.
“Umina—”
“It’s fine, Professor. Was—was that my question?”
“No. No, it wasn’t. Ask. By all means.”
He shook his head firmly. That relieved Umina. She sat up. And he looked at her.
“You have any question in the world, Umina. Any one within my power. Ask.”
She nodded. She looked him in the eye. And she channeled her pain, her disappointment, into a question that was the best she could ask.
“Professor, what is the identity of your mysterious chess opponent?”
Niers Astoragon blinked. He stared at Umina. And she rejoiced in the surprise on his face. He stared at her, smiled, and then grew serious. He shook his head.
“Ask me another question, Umina. Please.”
“That was my question, Professor. Can’t you answer it?”
She challenged him, shaking with nerves. The Titan laughed softly. He raked a hand through his hair.
“I’d forgotten there was a question I could be asked that would bother me! Sudden developments—to answer you, Umina. No. I don’t know for certain. I have a guess. And I could tell you a number of things. But let me speak.”
He held up a hand, forestalling Umina. The Titan got up, looked at her.
