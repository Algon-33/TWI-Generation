The [Witch] shrugged her shoulders listlessly. She shook her head.
“I hope he comes back. Riverfarm’s growing. And it’s difficult now. There’s so many new people. Did you see…?”
“No. I just went down one street. Then Prost pointed me here. I had to get away from it all.”
Another nod.
“You’ll see it tomorrow. Or the next few days. It’s amazing. But Prost and Rie have everyone doing jobs. Farming—there’s nearly a hundred people working the fields. They’re huge. So big that we need people with bows shooting down birds and animals trying to get at the seeds. And [Woodcutters], people quarrying stone—it’s incredible. But problematic. There’s crime now. [Bandits] have started raiding the area with Laken gone. As well as [Thieves] in the village. Town.”
Durene’s eyes widened. Bandits? Laken had helped crush a few groups early on, but the Goblins had scared most of them away. She looked at Wiskeria.
“That’s awful. Are you having trouble finding them?”
“Me?”
The [Witch] looked blank for a moment. Durene nodded and frowned.
“You’re our [General]. What’s the army doing? Are we putting out traps or hunting for them or what?”
Wiskeria was just shaking her head.
“No. No. I’m not—I quit, Durene. I stepped down. I’m not in charge of anything anymore.”
“What? Why?”
Thunderstruck, Durene looked down. The [Witch]’s face was covered by the brim of her hat.
“I shouldn’t be leading. I was the one who got everyone killed during the battle. All these graves? They’re because of me.”
“No. No, that was a bad order. Rie told me herself. Laken didn’t tell you to attack.”
That had been a shock too. Someone had betrayed Laken. Knocked out Nesor to send a [Message] telling Wiskeria to attack the Goblins. The [Witch] nodded.
“I know. But I obeyed it. And because I didn’t know what to do, we attacked and the Goblins defeated us. They would have wiped us all out, Durene, but for Lord Tyrion and Lord Pellmia. They saved us with an army of their own. But so many died…”
She gestured around at the graves. Durene swallowed.
“That wasn’t your fault, Wiskeria.”
The [Witch] paused.
“That’s kind of you to say. Few people agree with you. It doesn’t matter either way; the army’s disbanded. The remainder is sticking close to Riverfarm. We have a mounted group—the adventurers and [Soldiers] patrol around Riverfarm. But there’s no need for an army.”
“There’s every need. Laken’s bringing back Goblins. Hundreds of them!”
Durene snapped. Why was no one talking about that? Wiskeria just shook her head.
“He has his reasons. Whatever they are. When he comes back, he can appoint a new [General]. I’m just staying to make amends. There’s not one [Alchemist] among all the people of Riverfarm; they all were lured to other cities. There’s an [Herbalist], but she’s Level 9. I’m helping until Prost can find or train someone up.”
“Then what?”
“I’ll go.”
Wiskeria sighed. She looked so small, so deflated. Durene didn’t know what to say. She looked at Wiskeria. The [Witch] stared at Durene’s scar and then looked around.
“I’m going to clean up. Then gather some herbs. It’s good to see you, Durene.”
“You too?”
The [Witch] nodded, ignoring the question. She walked off. Durene let her go. She stared around the cemetery. And the sense of wrongness intensified. Durene hurried away, stepping carefully between the graves. Everything was so wrong. The village. Wiskeria. All of it. She didn’t head back to Riverfarm. Instead, she climbed, up, towards the forest. And her home. Hers and Laken’s. On the way she looked back once.
