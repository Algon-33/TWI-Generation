He told her. Don’t say that. The [Innkeeper] smiled at him. Gently. Her regrets. Her sorrows. Her triumphs. For a moment, he saw her hand rise. And he saw the light in her eyes.
The crowd around the fallen young woman fell completely quiet as a light illuminated the bloody hilltop. The light flashed from the [Innkeeper]’s fingertips.
It burned bright, a tiny little thing. As vast as a hundred burning lifetimes. A thousand stories. As small as a sigh.
The little flame was not one color. It was one and many, made up of so many things. Sadness, like blue despair. Hatred and mercy, invisible and grey.
Fleeting pink glory. And dozens more colors, in every shade, some that those who saw them would never be able to name.
Take it. The hazel eyes looked past the light. Perfectly calm.
She held it out, the spark. A dozen hands reached for it, hesitating. Wavering. Trying to keep it alive. Erin Solstice reached out, trying to—
Her eyes fluttered.
She exhaled.
The light winked out.
The hand fell.
Numbtongue caught the cold, cool hand. He stared, but the beautiful flame was gone. And—he waited.
“Erin?”
Lyonette whispered. Mrsha nudged the [Innkeeper]. Snapjaw’s claws trembled. Beza was frozen. She felt at Erin’s face. Then she looked up.
“She’s not breathing.”
Slowly, she pressed on Erin’s wrist. Felt at her neck. No one else moved in the world. The Minotauress whispered.
“Her heart’s stopped.”
Numbtongue’s world ended. He stared at the body, lying there. Slowly, he shook her. Hard. Harder. Her head wobbled. The faint smile—her closed eyes—
“Stop. Stop it.”
Snapjaw grabbed Numbtongue’s arm. He looked at her. Her crimson eyes were filled with tears.
“This is not happening.”
Palt spoke. He looked around. Searching the faces for someone who would wake him.
—an army of Antinium flooding out of the gates. The Watch charging up the hill. Forces from Pallass, hammering on the door.
Too late. It had just been minutes. 
She was…Erin Solstice was…
Kevin lowered his hands from the bloody scratches his fingernails had torn in his skin. He looked around. At the Goblins, the Antinium. Lyonette, Mrsha, the guests. Palt, Montressa, B—
“Freeze her.”
He grabbed Montressa. The [Aegiscaster] had lowered her hand. She stared at him. He shook her, insistently.
“What? Do what?”
“Fucking freeze her! As cold as you can! Do it! Do it now!”
Kevin’s voice suddenly rose. He shouted, looking around. The others started. Numbtongue saw Kevin shoving everyone out of the way. He looked at the [Mages].
“Freeze her! She’s not dead! Not entirely.”
“Kevin—”
“Not yet! Do it!”
Slowly—Palt looked at Montressa. Beza. Moore raised a faltering hand. They stared at Kevin. He shouted—and the frost covered the ground. Covering the young woman who lay there.
The Antinium rushed onto the hill. The Watch, Olesm, Zevara, Embria—Grimalkin burst out of the door to Pallass, followed by an army of [Soldiers], [Healers], [Mages], until the door winked out.
They stopped there. In time, the Silver Swords burst in through from Invrisil. The rest of the Halfseekers arrived. The Wings of Pallass. The Flamewardens.
Selys, disbelieving, weeping. The Council. More and more, crowding the hill. Fighting. Arguing, not ready to accept the lies.
Until they saw the body. The slight smile. The blood and frozen ground. Six casual, worthless pieces of wood and metal tipped in poison.
A petty revenge from a city few had even heard of. They looked down and waited for someone to tell them they were just having a nightmare.
But they never woke.
