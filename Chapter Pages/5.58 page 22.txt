The word struck him like a rock. Garen rocked back on his heels and saw a huge head lift. Moore hunched his broad shoulders. His voice was low, pained. He stared at Garen with grief and helpless anger. Regret.
“Traitor.”
There was no pity in Seborn’s eyes. He sat, motionless, his eyes burning. He spoke, his echoing voice a condemnation, a promise.
“Traitor.”
The Halfseekers stared at him. And Garen knew then that he would never hear anything else from them. Ever. They would never look at him differently. That knowledge was the bitterest poison on his tongue. He turned away from them.
“Fine. That is what you call me.”
He looked up. At his warriors, at Spiderslicer. Garen waved a claw.
“Kill them.”
Spiderslicer hesitated. He looked around. The other Redfangs looked from him to Garen, uncertain. Garen raised his voice, impatiently, hearing it break and hating that weakness.
“Kill them!”
“Yes, Chieftain.”
Mechanically, Spiderslicer stood. He drew his falchion, and walked forwards slowly. The other Redfangs looked at Garen. They had heard everything. They had heard his betrayal, and seen how his comrades, his old team refused to understand. Refused to listen. So why did they look at him with such horror? Garen tried to look away, but they were all around him. Why, why—
“Chieftain Garen!”
A voice spoke up. A body rose. Headscratcher barred Spiderslicer’s way. The shorter Goblin stared up at him. Spiderslicer frowned.
“Move, Headscratcher.”
Headscratcher didn’t budge. He spread his arms wide and looked at Garen.
“Chieftain Garen. Question.”
“Ask.”
Garen looked up. The sun had set. The stars were coming out. A cool wind blew on his face. He just wanted it to be done with. The Halfseekers could die. Then he could forget at last and go…go to the High Passes. Leave this place and never come back. Headscratcher’s voice was insistent as he blocked Spiderslicer. The smaller Goblin hesitated, and then decided to stay put.
“Chieftain Garen gave orders to us. Redfangs sent on mission. To kill Human. Innkeeper.”
“I did. And you did. So what?”
Rags didn’t know about that. Garen stared blankly at the rising moon. He heard a noise from one of the Halfseekers. Moore? Headscratcher lowered his voice.
“Didn’t.”
“What?”
Garen turned. He glared at Headscratcher. The Hob hunched his shoulders.
“Didn’t. Met innkeeper. She was nice.”
Rabbiteater nodded. He spoke up, his voice trembling slightly.
“She is good. Very good!”
“And has name.”
Shorthilt glanced up. Numbtongue nodded.
“Erin Solstice.”
“I told you to kill her.”
Garen’s voice was low. Furious. He glared at the Hobs and then realized the young woman he’d hit had been her. He’d wiped her from his mind, assuming she was dead. Garen thrust a finger at the Hobs, who flinched as one.
“You failed! Disobeyed orders!”
“Bad orders. And we tried.”
Badarrow met Garen’s eyes. The other Redfangs nodded. They spoke all together. Headscratcher was first. He summed up the entirety of the problem in four words.
“Got orders. Got lost.”
The other Redfangs groaned. They understood that. Garen held his tongue. Rabbiteater nodded quickly.
“Innkeeper left Celum. Couldn’t find trail. Many days walk.”
He gestured wildly, and Garen remembered that neither Grunter nor any of the warriors he’d sent had tracking Skills or classes. The other Redfangs nodded. Numbtongue spoke, his voice clear, as fluent as any Human. When had he begun talking so much? He used to refuse to speak so much as a word…
“We searched for her, and ran into a raiding party sent by the Goblin Lord. We found a city—Esthelm—”
