What he found was Wall Lord Ilvriss consulting with the Watch Commander, a [Weapon Master]—a half-Elf with several bruises—Shriekblade, Captain Shieldscale, four Wall Lords and Ladies, and a [Trainer]. To be precise, a [Field Trainer], who knew how to whip recruits into shape.
“—not going to be adopting shield-walls or pikes, Watch Commander. As I informed my peers, and you’re free to do the same, I want them armed with axes. Shields, yes. But this won’t be a formation-driven force. Ah, Alrric! There you are!”
The Wall Lord looked up. The previous recruits were already being drilled by the [Weapon Master] and [Trainer]. Alrric motioned the [Miners] towards the lines and walked over.
“I don’t get it, Ilvriss. Drake formations have stood the test of time!”
That comment came from Wall Lady Messele. She was younger, but taking an interest in this task-force. Ilvriss explained.
“It’s true that we haven’t needed to change our phalanx-tactics. A wall of Drakes with pikes or spears can fight Humans well, or battalions with military discipline in battle. But those are standard [Soldiers]. Captain Shieldscale?”
She saluted.
“Wall Lord Ilvriss is correct. Low-level [Soldiers] capitalize on their ability to fight as a unit, Wall Lady. However, these recruits are hand-picked for their existing Skills.”
“[Enhanced Strength]. [Greater Toughness]—there’s no uniformity in it.”
“Correct. So they’ll fight more individually. [Warriors], not [Soldiers]. We’ll provide enchanted arms, training—they’ll be shock troopers. Meant to take down hordes of enemies.”
Like the Antinium. Alrric shivered and saw the others doing the same. The half-Elf [Weapon Master] nodded.
“Antinium are thick. Their bodies are like thick, cheap armor. Swords and even spears don’t have enough force. Axes are the correct option, like if you were fighting undead. The Skills complement the fighters.”
He shot a glare at Shriekblade as she yawned openly. Alrric guessed from the half-Elf’s bruises that even the famed longevity of half-Elves hadn’t prepared him for a duel with a Named Adventurer. But Ilvriss seemed pleased.
“Elites, Messele. Elites. And remember—these will be the rank-and-file. This is the base upon which I want to form our task force.”
“Wouldn’t it be better to train up [Soldiers] with less levels? These…[Miners] will level slower.”
The Wall Lady looked at the [Miners], who were indeed decently high-level already. Level 15 at the lowest. Ilvriss and Wall Lord Tasilt shook their heads. Tasilt, the renegade who’d married a Gnoll looked pleased.
“It’s about combat theory, Messele. You want the most first-class of [Soldiers]? Sure, train them from childhood. But if you want fast, reliable fighters, take a bunch of [Farmers] and train them. A Level 5 [Warrior] with [Enhanced Strength] will take down a Level 15 [Soldier] in a single swing if you use him right.”
“Well—fine. But what about archers? I assume we want those. And [Mages]?”
The others laughed and Ilvriss stepped back as Tasilt explained.
“This is infantry, Messele! One step at a time!”
The Gnoll walked with Ilvriss a short ways. The Wall Lord nodded.
“Alrric, we’ve already got a good base. More than I expected.”
“Twenty gold is a lot for a [Miner]. We may come up with your two thousand soon, Ilvriss.”
“Well, let’s aim for four, then. Although that might be stretching how many we can gather.”
