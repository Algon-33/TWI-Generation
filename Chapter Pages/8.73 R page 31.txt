They were [Knights]. He had picked a dishonorable way of doing this, keeping them from attacking and trapping them by their logic.
Well, you could almost admire that; the [Strategists], dishonorable folk, and [Martial Artists] certainly enjoyed Rabbiteater’s fighting. But the [Knights] were simply willing to call that bluff.
Very well. If you will fight us—you fight all of us.
Three [Knights] before four [Knights]. And they began lining up. If you bring us down, ten, or even twenty, we will challenge you until you fall.
Sound, knightly logic. It looked stupid to Seraphel as anything. Not Rabbiteater; she had to admit the [Knight] was a genius. But she would have simply ordered him taken down.
But not in front of the world, and not if you were a [Knight].

Ser Solstice began struggling on the sixth [Knight]. By now, the [Knights] had realized he was possibly the greatest hand-to-hand specialist in the entire keep. So they didn’t send the highest-level or most senior members against him, but [Knights] who could fight and had the Skills.
Order of the Hydra, mostly. And Rabbiteater might have been a veteran Goblin and [Champion]—but he was still fighting people until one of them was unconscious or unable to rise.
A [Knight] knocked him flat three times, and Rabbiteater’s arms shook as he got up. He took a flurry of punches and reeled.
“Ser Solstice! Give!”
He heard someone shouting at him to stop from behind. Worried for him? The Goblin touched at some blood leaking from his helmet and looked up. Through his visor, he saw the Hydra Knight waiting for him.
He leapt at his opponent and tackled them down the hill. Rabbiteater got lucky and grabbed a leg, broke it—
A seventh [Knight] dismounted and waited for him.
The Goblin’s breath wheezed in his lungs. Then it whistled when his ribs cracked. His eighth opponent allowed him a potion.
The ninth waited as he got up; his opponent was being dragged from the field. The Thirsting Veil [Knight] spoke.
“There is no shame in surrendering, Ser. You have bested eight of our number, however trickily.”
She waited as the dented helmet slowly rose. A rasping voice replied from behind the dark visor.
“Ten is a good number.”
The [Knight]’s eyes narrowed, and she slapped her visor down.
“If it could ever be reached.”
The tenth [Knight] saw Rabbiteater kneeling there. Not to him, but just tired. Yet when the [Champion] looked up, the [Knight] hesitated. He raised his fists and waited for Rabbiteater to move.

The eleventh [Knight] realized something was wrong too late. It was too late when Ser Yoriven, the very same Hydra Knight that had met the Wind Runner at the capital, stepped forwards.
He was a former [Fistfighter], a tough on the streets of Ailendamus who had impressed a [Knight] he’d punched and been given another chance.
This was not how he expected to fight this war, but he was exasperated and even a bit impressed by this crazed [Knight].
Yet he had seen the [Knight] growing weaker after ten opponents. Yoriven had heard the others speculating Yoriven would take him down; ten was a good, honorable number. It proved he was not just a desperate fool.
This was not how Yoriven wanted to fight, and he asked the same question.
“Will you heal, Ser? I regret that I cannot offer you a potion. Adjust your armor? Remove your helmet?”
The helmet was dented—badly. Yet the strange [Knight] shook his head. He took another moment, panting. Then he rose.
“Let’s fight.”
