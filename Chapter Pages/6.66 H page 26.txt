Someone spoke to the side. Yvlon turned her head and saw a Drake with crimson scales staring at her. Embria waved a hand towards the door.
“An adult Creler. You killed it. The four of you.”
Embria looked at the four adventurers, mystified. Yvlon blinked up at her.
“Oh. Well, we had help.”
“How did you—you’re alive.”
Erin buried her face in Ceria’s shoulder. Then she cried out; her tears were freezing! The half-Elf poked herself.
“I guess we are. Right, Yvlon?”
“Yes.”
Yvlon blinked. She opened her mouth and closed it a few times. Embria stared at her, but Yvlon just went back to hugging Ksmvr. She didn’t have anything else to say.
Erin turned and grabbed Yvlon and Ksmvr. Then another pair of arms encircled them. Bird. Yvlon felt Mrsha jump at her, sniffing her arms—
“Yvlon! Ceria! Pisces!”
Alais was making her way over to them. She was barely able to walk, but she was alive. So were Palt, Beza, the Minotauress staring in shock. Ulinde waved excitedly from her ruined body. Moore was limping up the hill as Jelaqua carried a protesting Seborn in her arms. They were staring. And someone began shouting.
“Hammerad! The Horns of Hammerad!”
“Crelerbane! Hell’s wardens!”
Someone else bellowed it. Walt. He was pointing at the Horns, laughing and sobbing. His three teammates stood around him. The last—Yvlon looked around as people took up the chant.
“Hammerad! Horns of Hammerad!”
“You did it.”
A flash of red hair. Not Lyonette—she was hugging with Mrsha. Pisces turned.
“Montressa.”
She bowed towards him, silently. There were too many words, not enough. Not in this moment. Grimalkin roared above the shouting.
“We have witnessed an extraordinary event! A feat that few in this world can boast of! The death that comes from Rhir has been slain by a team of adventurers! The Horns of Hammerad!”
Now the Watch and the [Soldiers] took up the chant. The adventurers were saluting them. Grimalkin looked at the Horns. He just nodded, folding his arms, approvingly. Yvlon didn’t know what to make of it all.
“But so many died. It wasn’t just us. It was—”
“You. And Ksmvr. With a little help.”
Pisces looked at Yvlon, smiling crookedly. He glanced at Ceria. The half-Elf smiled as snow fell around her. She stared at Yvlon’s arms. Erin sneezed.
“It’s cold! Can you turn that off?”
“I’ll figure it out.”
Ksmvr just remained still. He whispered, so softly that Yvlon was the only one who could hear. And some of the Gnolls.
“You must not die. Promise?”
“I promise.”
That was all Yvlon said. Then she felt tears fill her eyes.
Enough. Say no more. In silence, she hugged her friends, as the cheers became a roar, applause. But Yvlon needed only this moment. That was all she wanted. No levels, no Skills. Let it be for a while. Silently, the Horns embraced each other. Then they rose and looked about.
The inn was broken. The dead unburied. Darkness had come again. And it still waited. It had torn and tried to bury the sparks of light. In the end, the world was still not perfect. Soon, they would count the fallen.
But for one moment. Right now—Erin Solstice clung to her friends. The Horns of Hammerad held each other and the crowd of [Guards], adventurers, [Soldiers], and civilians, [Barmaids], [Princess], [Waiters], [Mages], and the little Gnoll cheered. And the noise chased away the future.
From his seat, the Necromancer bowed. And a skeleton watched, seeing something else, something he didn’t quite understand. And he saw her face, laughing and smiling. But even that was later.
