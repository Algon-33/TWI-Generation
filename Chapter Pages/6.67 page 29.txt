Ceria sniffed. Erin looked at them. And then she did cry. The last day of spring was a bright one, too bright and warm for tears. But they fell anyways. For good or ill. For that truth of truths.
Everything changes.

He saw no light of day in his cell. Nor did he see his friends. Calruz the Minotaur could neither move nor stand. But he was alive.
“I’m alive. I’m still alive.”
The Minotaur wept and laughed, uncontrollably. Despair and a fierce relief ran through him. Despite it all! He had hurled himself into the heart of the inn, into death.
And it hadn’t been given to him. He could have died with honor. But they had found him. Erin had. And she’d pulled him back.
Into hell. Into damnation. Calruz saw a little rat scurry over him and nibble at one of his bandages. It fled as he laughed again, hysterically.
“You should have let me die. Why? Why didn’t she? Why didn’t you?”
Watch Captain Zevara sat on a little stool across from Calruz. She looked at him.
“I suppose because I’m a cruel person. Because I think you can still earn redemption. Because I don’t want you to die. As for Miss Solstice? She can be cruel.”
Calruz looked at her. The Minotaur laughed again, hoarsely.
“I leveled. I changed my class.”
The [Honorbound Prisoner] stared at the [Watch Captain]. She smiled, slightly. Then she looked past him.
“I can’t change your cell, Calruz. Nor can I pardon you for your crimes. Or prove your guilt or innocence one way or another. Not yet. But I can do what is in my power as Watch Captain. You won’t earn your freedom for risking your life once. Even against Crelers.”
“I just wanted honor. And death.”
The Minotaur whispered. Zevara paused.
“I know. But I can’t give it to you. I still see an innocent person in my cells. One day, I’ll prove it. Until then, I’m sentencing you to hard labor. To—certain death. Should the Watch be in need.”
“Again?”
Something like hope surfaced in the Minotaur’s eyes. Zevara looked at him.
“There’s always something. I can’t offer you anything else.”
“But you’ll let me fight? Let me—face odds like that again?”
“It’s a promise.”
The Drake looked at Calruz. Slowly, the Minotaur sat up. His body screamed. But his soul shouted louder. He looked at Zevara. And he recalled the nature of the Skill he had gained. His new class.
Maybe it was wrong. Or maybe he could believe he’d reclaimed something he thought lost forever. Perhaps it wasn’t for the system to decide. But for a second, Calruz let himself believe. He looked at Zevara and closed his eyes. The Skill burned its name into his mind, louder than the whispers. A promise.
Salvation.
 
[Death Before Dishonor].
 
“Thank you.”

After a while, Erin stopped crying. She sniffled, wiped at her eyes, and hugged Ceria fiercely. Then Yvlon. Pisces demurred until she squeezed him tight, and he hugged her back, gently.
Ksmvr was last. The Antinium looked at her, and she saw their history together. But she reached for him and he uncertainly spread his arms.
“You!”
A furious voice broke the peaceful moment. Erin whirled. And she saw a furious person charging at Ksmvr.
Bird. The Worker rammed into Ksmvr, knocking the [Skirmisher] back. But true to his new Skills, Ksmvr just caught himself. He backed up as Bird attacked, all four arms swinging wildly.
“You! It is your fault! You—you bad Ksmvr! Idiot! Fool! All of you!”
He swung his arms wildly, at Yvlon. She raised an arm, but Ksmvr blocked Bird. The [Bird Hunter] flailed at Ksmvr as Erin, startled, cried out.
“Bird! What are you doing?”
