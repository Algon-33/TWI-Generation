Author’s Note: I am full dead. Normally I’m half-dead after a chapter…this is full dead.
A few things. Normally, I don’t talk about writing and more about whether I’m hungry. But this is a case where you can see why I wrote the Revenant and the Naga. To set this up by talking about Fetohep…
Also, I wavered on one thing. Which was the ending. I could have held it to a later chapter and done the meeting—and I was already about 10,000 words past where I wanted to be.
But this is the volume of plot advancing as fast as undead armies! And that’s pretty fast. They can outrun horses over time.
Anyways. Let me know what you thought. I threw a lot into this chapter. I keep aiming at the moon and the problem with that is that someone’s going to shoot back one of these days!
But I hope you liked it. Until next time! Short chapter! Short chapter! Short…why do I even try to lie to myself? Thanks for reading!
