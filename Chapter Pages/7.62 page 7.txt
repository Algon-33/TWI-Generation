‘May contain small nuts.’
Only—he wasn’t laughing. Saliss of Lights.
Maviola El.
Erin Solstice.
What had those damned Drakes done? What had those cowards brought low? How had this happened?
What would happen now?

Time passed. First—Maviola El was just stunned. Disbelieving. Then it hit her. And she stood and joined the mourners.
Wailant Strongheart was gone. He had stumbled down the hill and was tending to the Sage’s Grass. Checking each leaf and the roots. A little bee buzzed around him, as if grateful for the company.
Viceria was listening as someone else took the small podium and spoke. Garia was still weeping. Her face buried in her arms.
“Ah, no.”
Maviola whispered when it was her turn to stand in front of Erin. She looked down. Searching for a sign of life. She only saw the smile. The closed eyes. No breath. Ice. Why ice?
“My heir of flame. You were supposed to live. I—I—why before me? I was supposed to die in the north! You were to keep Izril’s flame alight. To be—”
Maviola El was on her knees. She reached for the bier—but a powerful magic forced her hand away. Someone had protected it.
Saliss of Lights, the [Alchemist] of Pallass, the Named Adventurer, just sat there. Cross-legged. He murmured into the silence as Maviola El wept.
“I told you all. I’m the hero of the story. Everyone else dies. Except me.”
Liscor mourned. Maviola El lost track of time. Her plans fell to ruin. It all came undone.
How could you expect things to be the same? Erin was dead. Who was going to…? The inn? The north? The magic door?
The future had been uncertain, but bright, even if you didn’t know it. You knew it had been bright. Because now, the light had gone out. And everything was shrouded.
After a while, someone noticed she was here. Someone from the inn.
An Antinium was walking up and down the hill. Bringing bowls of food to the Antinium curled up. They didn’t eat—until he made them. With cruelty. With merciless words. With a kind of ruthlessness that he had learned, somehow.
“Eat. Eat the food or Erin would be sad.”
“Eat. Or you will have failed her twice.”
It was—Garry. Maviola heard his voice. Of all of the Antinium, only he was somehow moving. He made the Workers and Soldiers eat—then let them collapse once more.
It was not a kindness he did. Nor one they would ever thank him for. It was a selfish duty of command. Maviola had seen, done the same. Garry ascended the hill and saw her.
“Oh.”
That was all he said. Then he left. After a while, Lyonette stumbled up the hill.
“Maviola? Saliss?”
She cried out. The two turned. They looked at her. The [Princess] was pale. She carried a little Gnoll in her arms. Mrsha had fallen asleep. Lyonette didn’t want to put her down, even though she was heavy and almost too big to carry.
“Oh, dead gods. You two—”
“Hi.”
Saliss stared at Lyonette. Then he went back to looking at Erin.
“Who did this?”
Maviola’s head rose. Lyonette just shook her head. Grief hit her a second time. She hadn’t told Maviola. She’d forgotten they were returning.
“I—I can’t explain. Not here. Come down. To the inn. Do you want to eat? I can—I can tell you there.”
Maviola El didn’t want to eat. But Lyonette was desperate for something to do. So she let the [Princess] take her by the arm, pull her gently down—
Someone pushed past her, nearly knocking her down. The [Lady] stumbled. She saw a cluster of Antinium. Garry included, trying to hold a Worker back.
“I must. I must.”
Pawn struggled forwards. The other Antinium—Yellow Splatters, Purple Smile, Garry, Chesacre, Thaina—tried to hold him back without hurting him.
