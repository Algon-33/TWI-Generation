A voice exploded amidst the appearing [Time Mages]. Emerrhain was tearing at his hair. Even the other dead gods were shocked. But the answer was obvious.
“The Oath of Time! We have sworn to protect it!”
An [Archmage] holding an actual clock—an old-fashioned watch—looked around. He called out amidst glory and wonder and horror.
“A second chance! We have been moved through the river of ages itself! But—dead gods! The Clockmakers themselves!”
He goggled at the Gnomes, one of whom waved at him. It was the answer to one of magic’s great mysteries. Why no one had ever found the body of a [Time Mage], no matter how they died.
In every age, from the beginning to the end, they were appearing. Erin’s eyes widened as she saw more appear. A furious Human man.
“I almost ruled Wistram! Almost but for that damned half-Elf and Goblin!”
Another [Mage] was shouting.
“Archmage, the Drakes have our flanks! That Truestone Golem is throwing s—”
The Lamia ducked—then looked up. The Devourer of Time looked down and swatted the Lamia out of existence. The other [Time Mages] recoiled.
The Timewalker did not like this. It sensed some kind of danger and went to attack again. Reality twisted—
And stabilized. A dozen [Time Mages] threw up their hands, and time refused to skip. They dove, some splashing into the water, others just diving. One tried to [Teleport] and was hit.
“What is going on—”
Udatron was still gazing around, but more [Mages] were arriving. One appeared with a howl of magic.
The Great General of Ailendamus, the General of Ages, Dioname, opened her eyes. One hand was still reaching out, stealing the last of Tyrion Veltras’ age. She raised her head and looked up.
“Ah. Rhisveri never told me about this.”
The half-Elf gazed upwards with a terrible fear…and a kind of satisfaction. Indeed, the other [Time Mages] might panic or take time to understand what was happening as their personalities dictated, but they had all known it.
They had all sensed their end. Dionamella saw the truth she had sensed.
Her end.
So the half-Elf glanced around, then took aim at the Timewalker. She lifted a hand.
“[Disintegration Ray].”
The colorless, nigh-invisible beam hit the Timewalker in the leg, so tiny as to be a speck taken out of a mountain beyond Giants. But…part of the Devourer of Time vanished.
It had not learned how to eat magic. It was still a child. The other [Time Mages] saw that. Most acted instinctively.
“[Ritual of the Cataclysm: The Storm of the Lightning Emperor]! Cover me!”
An [Archmage] rose into the air, bellowing as other [Mages] dove. One was swimming towards the Timewalker until an exasperated [Mage] cast [Levitate].
They were not all of the same level. But they knew their foe and duty. Udatron snarled and raised a hand.
“[Grand Fireball]. [Magnify Spell]. [Infuse Spell: Poison]. I will not die here! Thresk!”
They were casting magics from the beginning to the end. The surprised dead gods saw the reinforcements light up the lower half of the Timewalker as it stopped walking and began attacking them.
It was in danger. Seamwalkers were trying to eat it, and the enraged ghosts of every time were assaulting the great horror. Erin Solstice looked up in awe at the terrific battle as Dionamella lifted her hands.
“[Summoning: Avatar of the Wyrm-Queen].”
She was conjuring something big. Spells of such magnitude were flying through the air that the lesser [Time Mages] contributing their [Fireball] spells quickly realized their best bet was to guard their higher-level compatriots against the Seamwalkers.
