Bird, silly Bird. Do you think I am incapable? What do you think happened when I levelled and got my newest class?
[Grandmaster Strategist]. We make excellent pacts, don’t we? You help me, and I’ll help you. It’s not like I have an army to return to. It will be a while before I can use it again, but I was saving it for now.
His finger rose as he stood in the grass, and the Vampire leapt into the air, unable to keep still. Screaming for her blood to awaken. The Titan’s finger wavered. From her, to Ulvama, to Snapjaw, to…Gothica…back towards the camp. He could sense them, if not see them.
At last, he used the greatest Skill he owned. Higher than his Level 60 Skill. The Skill of a [Strategist] who multiplied everything.
Niers Astoragon spoke.
“[Promote the Pawn: Class Ascension].”

It broke over them like a wave, as they slept, as the extra Goblins curled up, unnoticed, happily levelling themselves. Snapjaw tried blearily to count them, but fell asleep, too tired for some reason.

Ulvama’s eyes opened wide. She looked around. Alright. That was not earned.
Who was doing this?
Who was watching her? Who was…?

The little man, counting, choosing. Elevate the best. Bring up the worst. He failed once.

Fierre’s eyes opened wide. She sat up bolt upright as a Goblin curled up happily. Another voice was stuttering in Gothica’s mind.

Nobody knew his name. He did not have a name.
A Soldier who hadn’t been lucky enough to be painted. A unit in the rest of the Hive. Someone who had seen it.
He had been there when Skinner died and torn pieces out of nightmare.
