The [Mages] not immediately paralyzed and nearest to him with a line of fire shot spells from their wands or fingers. All of them vanished before they could touch Eldavin. Even Tier 3 spells! As soon as they crossed the lines of the barrier, they dissipated.
“I return to the halls of Wistram! Are there no true [Mages] to greet me? Have you forgotten so soon what you used to be?”
Eldavin thundered. The first barrage of spells ceased. [Mages] lowered their wands. The half-Elf turned.
“[Lancearrow of Light]!”
Teura aimed her spell at him. This time, Eldavin moved.
“[Stone Wall]!”
A thick wall of stone six feet wide shot up and blocked the spell. Teura blinked. That was fast! She saw more [Mages] aiming, but Eldavin was already widening the wall. He created a semi-circle around himself, then spoke.
“[Ice Wall], [Light Wall], and er…no, that should do it. [Fivefold Arcane Barrier]!”
Layers of ice, stone, and light sprang up around him, and a central magical barrier appeared. He was lost from vision.
“—must be mad—”
Viltach was on his feet, fury in his eyes. He spotted the barriers and lifted a finger.
“[Ray of Shattering]! [Lightning Tempest]!”
The first pale ray struck the wall of rock and shattered it to pieces. Bolts of lightning followed, drumming beats that blew the wall of ice to bits, then the light barrier. And behind it, the arcane barrier shimmered as Eldavin held up his hands, chanting.
“Evacuate the hall. Viltach! Don’t kill him! Vilt—”
Too late. The lighting burst through the barrier. Feor saw Eldavin illuminate as the bolts struck him. There was a flash. Feor was blinded for a second and cursed.
Was he dead? Surely he had—
Viltach lowered his finger. The bolts of lightning subsided. Everyone saw the broken shell of defensive magics was empty. Eldavin? A pillar of rock vaguely shaped like him was broken down to the base, molten stone cooling.
Where—
“Aaah! Help, h—”
Mage Rievan whirled around. He saw Timor and Charles de Trevalier. The two young men were alive and…floating? Behind them, Grand Magus Eldavin pointed a finger.
“[Stone Fist].”
“Wh—”
Rievan received a punch to his chest from a block of stone. He went over another table and didn’t rise.
“You! Put them down!”
“[Arrow of Light].”
Eldavin flicked a huge bolt of glowing magic far larger than Trey could muster under Charles’ body. Viltach flinched and it burst on his personal shields. He raised his finger—hesitated.
“Get them out of the way!”
The half-Elf calmly adjusted Timor as Libertarians, the nearest group to him, scrambled to spread out. He was flicking more jets of magic out.
“[Stun Bolt]. [Shock Orb]. Um…[Arrow of Light], again.”
He tagged a dozen [Mages] who went flopping down, paralyzed, shocked, or just knocked silly. One aimed a wand at him—he put Timor’s flailing behind in the way.
“Stop that! Are you mad?”
A [Mage] shrieked at Eldavin. He just turned his head and pointed a finger. She deflected the glowing bolt of magic and aimed a wand at him. He sighed and flicked his finger.
“Not many [Battlemages] here.”
The wand in the woman’s hand flicked across the room. She faltered and the spell she had been casting dissipated.
“My w—”
Flick, flick, flick—half the [Mages] with a poor grip on their wands promptly lost theirs. Eldavin regarded them, and then tossed them telekinetically across the room.
“I told those Bronze-rank adventurers they were poor spellcasters. But at least they could grip their wands.”
“Someone get Charles and Timor!”
