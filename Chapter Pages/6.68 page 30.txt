Ryoka could have said the Unseen Empire, Riverfarm. Laken. But she made a decision. And the world changed. Rose’s eyes widened. The Earthworlders looked up.
“It’s a long ways away. But I’ll help you as much as I can. But you’ll have to make the journey.”
“What? But—”
Ryoka ignored the protests. She looked at Alber.
“I’m going to find a wagon. Anyone to take them. Will you ride with them? I’m going to stay. See who wins.”
She pointed at the mansion. Alber just looked at her. Top to toe, mystified.
“Who are you?”
“Me? I’m just a Runner.”
Ryoka pointed at her chest. The [Fistfighter] shook his head.
“Sure you are.”
He paused. Ryoka had to laugh. She held out her hand. And Alber took it. His palm was callused and rough, and his grip was strong. Ryoka shook Alber’s hand.
It was so simple. Ryoka turned back as she ran towards a moving wagon, shouting for the driver to stop. Termin raised his brows. And Ryoka felt it in her bones.
Changing. Everything was, not just her. She almost smiled. Then she feared for the future. But she looked back, at the lost group from Earth. And she thought of her friend. Trouble was coming her way. Or at the very least…
Interesting times.

Peace. Consequence. Growth. Rebuilding. Plans for the future. Alliances. Regrets. War. The world changed. It repeated history. It stood still.
None of it mattered. None of it at all. The world was a vast, uncaring place. Coincidence looked like fate. Here, now, was all.
And the world itself paused. He felt it. Nothing mattered outside of this building. This place. There was only him.
And her.
There she was. After all this time, after so long. Toren the skeleton stood in The Wandering Inn, arms outspread. Welcoming the young woman who sat at the table in front of him. Amid the broken inn, the partially collapsed ceiling and floor. The inn was not what Toren remembered. But it was still the inn.
And he was home. So was she. The young woman with her light, brown hair with that slight hint of orange, hazel eyes. Longer hair than he remembered. Different clothes. But that was all. She was the same person. His owner, his mistress, his…
Erin Solstice.
“Toren…?”
She spoke, breathing the words. He smiled.
It had been a long time. So long, he had almost forgotten her voice. But he couldn’t really forget. To Toren, memory was unfading.
Even so, she was here. In front of him. Erin. The skeleton waited. The young woman, the [Innkeeper] half-rose. Paused. Staring. She hadn’t seen him for a long time. He’d seen her lie down at the table, pretend to level up. And he had been waiting.
“Are—how—”
Erin Solstice stumbled over her words. She stared at him, her eyes wide, breathing faster. Toren saw it all as he waited.
He had waited a long time for this. Hiding, watching the inn from afar. He had run out of mana potions, even. So he’d come to the inn.
It made sense. The door was gone, hauled out by the Drakes and Gnolls. So the inn was full of mana. Full of magic! It astounded Toren. When had this come about? It filled him, gave him strength. He could live, here. And only here. If he ran, he might make it to the dungeon.
But he wasn’t going back. Toren looked at Erin. Studying her as she tried to process his being there.
There she was. Alive. But he didn’t feel her. She was—gone.
She’d tried to kill him. The thought hit the skeleton again and the purple flames in his eyes flickered. That was the truth.
No—maybe it was an accident? Maybe, yes, maybe all of her magic had gone into the inn. That was a possibility.
