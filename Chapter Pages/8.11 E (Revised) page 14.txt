Erin tried to turn around. She lifted a fist. But…the woman was walking towards her. And she was reaching out. Three hands, one hand.
“Want, child? No. Don’t you understand? Look at me and know. You are mine.”
She was smiling. Erin clenched her hand.
“Don’t—I’ll—I’ll hit you—”
Every part of Erin was telling her not to touch Kasigna. But there was nowhere to go. No Skills to use. There was only this place and Kasigna was this place.
Erin was dead. And the woman smiled.
“It will not hurt, Erin. I am the meaning in death. I am comfort. Take my hand willingly and come with me. For I have returned and I guide all souls. You and I will be one thing. And is that not glorious?”
“No. Stop. I don’t want to.”
The [Innkeeper] whispered. The hand reached out. Vast as everything here. As small as her own hand. Erin called for something. A Skill. A frying pan. Anything.
“T-Tamaroth?”
The word echoed louder than it should.
But the man with the beard did not appear. And Kasigna’s face turned wrathful.
“He has no authority here. You would choose him over me? There is no choice here. Enough.”
She grabbed for Erin. As her hand closed on Erin’s arm, Kasigna recoiled. Erin heard a sound. An exclamation. She saw a light.
It was no glorious beam of daylight heaven-sent. It was far more mortal. Smaller, but somehow, brighter. It glowed across her arm, and then the air. Erin’s eyes widened as Kasigna hissed.
“What insolence is this?”
The two stared at the burning flame. It looked so familiar. She heard a voice.
“Well? Run already! Flee, my heir of fire!”
The voice! Erin started. And she realized—she could move! Somehow, even though there was no space. She turned.
“Stop! Insolent fire!”
Kasigna hissed. She reached out, but the flame moved first. A hand reached out and touched her. And the fire engulfed the stranger.
“Begone, thing!”
The fire laughed as Kasigna made a sound. Erin realized she was running. And there were voices. Behind her, the nothingness that was Kasigna was receding. And as she fled—
“—hurry, hurry.”
“—is coming. Someone has to—”
“Not you. Not you, please.”
“Run!”
A voice snapped. Erin looked back once. She was standing in front of the bathroom door, fumbling for the knob. But there wasn’t one! Behind her, Kasigna was engulfed in fire, yet it didn’t seem to be scorching her as much as infuriating. She was striding towards Erin.
A voice snapped from ahead of her.
“Hurry, girl!”
Erin had never heard the speaker before, but the voice was real and it gave her hope. She grabbed the edge of the door and tried to yank it open. Hands began to push it open. Hands? Of every shape. She saw a claw, a Human hand—
“What’s happening? What is that flame?”
She reached out. Kasigna was moving faster. And the flame—dying. Still laughing. Erin tried to squeeze into the opening and a hand caught her and began to drag.
A woman with a pointed hat pulled at Erin as Kasigna’s world tried to drag her back.
She looked at the flickering flame.
“You knew her as Maviola El. She is sacrificing herself for you. Now, run.”
She pulled Erin out of the door. And then Erin was stumbling. Standing—
Three people stood around her. One was the woman with a hat. She straightened it and slammed the door shut. The others dragged Erin up. A Drake wearing gilded armor snapped at the others.
“All this for a Human? We have to go, now! She is—”
The door slammed. Kasigna recoiled. And Erin realized the woman was standing right in front of them. There wasn’t a door. That was—
“Insolence.”
