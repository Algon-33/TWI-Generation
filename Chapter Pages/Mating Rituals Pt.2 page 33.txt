Mating Rituals Pt.2

“Why is he upset?”
Yellow Splatters murmured to Anand. But most of the males in the room looked horrified. Menolit stared at the Antinium. Erin sighed.
They had never had genitalia to lose, which was sort of the point. But Relc just stared at the Antinium and then gave them all hugs.
“Ancestors. Not even once?”
“Is this a bad thing?”
“Can we not have sex, then?”
The Drake turned to the others. No one wanted to answer.
“I mean—you can do some things. But the big thing? No. I’m sorry.”
He put his claw solemnly on Belgrade’s shoulder. The Antinium sighed.
“Alas.”
“Relc, maybe we can take them to a brothel. Pay a male Drake and a female one. Or Gnolls. I know a few. At least let them see. And there are other things, yes?”
Beilmark was whispering to Relc. The Drake was nodding.
“Yeah, yeah. They can see it—”
“Absolutely not!”
Erin shouted. That was it. The room went still as the [Innkeeper]’s aura crashed down. And suddenly, there was silence.
Erin Solstice walked forwards. She glared at Relc, at Selys, at everyone. And she was angry.
“Are you all mad? They’re kids! Belgrade’s not even three! They just learned about clouds last year! They shouldn’t know about sex!”
She was so angry she was shaking. The others looked at her, unable to move or argue back. Relc was slowly raising one claw—Erin stared at him and his arm shook. But he seemed determined to speak. And if he did—Erin was gonna deck him. It was unacceptable. It was not right!
“Excuse me. May I speak?”
Someone spoke under the crushing weight of the aura. Erin blinked. Her control was such that even Lyonette was moving in slow-motion. Erin’s aura was fueled by anger. But it was Belgrade who was speaking.
Her anger was not directed at him. Now, the [Tactician] spoke brightly to Erin and the room. He nodded slightly at Erin.
“I would like to see sex. I would like to try it, whatever I can do with my limitations.”
Erin looked at him.
“Belgrade. I’m sorry, but no. It’s too early. And you’re too—”
“Young?”
“Yeah. Belgrade, you need to be adults before you have sex. At least eight—no, at least sixteen! Yeah! Sixteen! Wait—is it sixteen?”
Erin had to think. The Antinium looked at her. And then…they shook their heads.
“No, Erin. I would like to have it now. Please.”
Belgrade spoke quietly. Erin stared at him. She looked at Yellow Splatters, and Anand, and even Garry. And they were nodding.
“I as well.”
“I would like to try it.”
“If I could share it with all Antinium, I would.”
It was Belgrade who went on, speaking to Erin. Belgrade, who wept for the dead. Who was unsure of his place. But he spoke with a level voice, never looking away from Erin.
“I understand we are considered young by your standards, Miss Erin. But I would like to…try this thing known as sexual intercourse. Even if I cannot, even if I am young. For I am afraid we will never be the age you seek. Not sixteen. Or ten. Or even eight. Most Antinium never live past four years. I cannot remember one who has lived six years, besides the Queen and Revelator Klbkch.”
The other three Antinium nodded. They were hungry. In a way like children, but also…adults. Like people, wanting, searching for something they had never known existed. Just like a thirsty man longed for water even if he had never seen it in his life.
“I do not understand the pleasure of it. But I would like to.”
The [Trapsetter Tactician] looked around. He looked at Erin, and then touched his chest.
