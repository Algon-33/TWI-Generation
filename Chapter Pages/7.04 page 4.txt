It was like that, she remembered. Surprise. A normal day, where you expected everything to go one way. And then—in a moment—everything changed. She looked around the inn.
And nothing was quite the same ever again.

It took a minute after Klbkch had left for the babble to start up again. But when it did, it was focused. The moment of Klbkch’s rage had focused everyone.
“I can’t believe he did that.”
Erin stared at Bird. She fumbled for a healing potion.
“Here. Erin, we must leave. Yellow Splatters, form up the Antinium.”
Pawn looked at Erin, handing out a bottle. She took it. He was not surprised.  Pawn opened his hands and nearly reached for Bird for some reason.
“[Minor—]. No. Use the potion, Erin.”
He looked around. The Antinium were already marching out the door, silently. Erin saw the two strange Antinium leaving too. They weren’t the only ones. Zevara started.
“I’ve never seen Klbkch—is that his idea of discipline? Ancestors.”
Then she looked at Erin. Her eyes widened.
“Ancestors. Ancestors. I have to get back to Liscor. The other cities must be in an uproar. I—”
She stared at the door. Then at the [Innkeeper] again. Erin checked Bird, kneeling to inspect his head.
“Are you okay, Bird?”
“I am all better.”
Erin looked up at the Watch Captain.
“It wasn’t my fault. I think. Well, maybe Bird was. But—”
She tried lamely to explain. Zevara just shook her head.
“Tell me later. Miss Solstice, keep the—keep Bird out of Pallass. I need to—Sergeant Relc, on me!”
“Yeah.”
Relc murmured, staring out the door Klbkch had left from. He went over to the magic door and set it to Liscor, pulled it open. That made some of the others move as well. Lism hurried out of the crowd. Erin stared at him as he brushed past her. The Drake’s head turned and he snapped.
“The Council needs to convene at once. The other cities will need our input. Watch Captain, Olesm, we’re meeting at once. Let’s go!”
“Elirr.”
Krshia appeared with the other Gnoll. Both looked at Erin. Krshia half-smiled.
“Erin. We must talk later—”
They vanished through the door. More Gnolls and Drakes hurried after them, some to shout about what they’d seen. The inn was depopulating fast. Some people stayed, wanting to talk to Erin, but she focused—
[Crowd Control]. And [Inn’s Aura]. They stayed back, murmuring amongst themselves. Erin looked around as familiar faces appeared. A Hobgoblin pushed towards Erin. The little Gnoll cub was still there. Mrsha had hid behind Erin. Now, Lyonette swept her up.
A bee floated past Erin. She looked at them, and then at Bird. He was crouched, eating his Wyvern wing. Erin looked at her family in the other world. Lyonette was wide-eyed, holding Mrsha. It was Numbtongue who eyed the door by which Klbkch had left. Then he looked at Erin. The Hobgoblin was least surprised out of anyone in the room by the previous moments. He shrugged and then grinned.
“Wyverns. Lots of Wyverns. Hard to beat, even for Redfangs. Cold ones are even harder. It was a nice fight.”
He held out a hand. Erin took it. The Hobgoblin [Bard] effortlessly pulled her up. Now, Mrsha squirmed and waved her paws. Erin went over to her.
“Oh, Mrsha.”
She gave the little Gnoll a huge hug, squeezing her tight. Erin felt someone else hug her. Lyonette. Numbtongue was inspecting Bird’s head. Erin looked around.
“It’s never quiet with me around, is it? Sorry.”
The [Princess] almost laughed.
“For what? I was so worried. We all were. What was that with Klbkch? He was—Pawn said he’s not like we know him in the Hive. But I never thought—”
