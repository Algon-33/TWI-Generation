The City Runner ran on. Coughing, choking as the smoke grew heavier. She tried to keep low, but beyond this point had been when Charlay passed out. She tried to call the wind—and it blew some fresh air into her face. She gasped, coughed—ran on.
Past a hill with a tree. A rope still hung from one of the branches. And a bit of unmarked soil marked a traitor’s grave. A [Witch] with a huge hat sat at the base of the hill. Her clothes were dark. Her eyes orange and ringed. She looked up as Ryoka passed by.
“Oh, hello. Terrible weather, isn’t it?”
The City Runner stopped. She stared wide-eyed at Belavierr. The Stich Witch was just sitting there. She glanced up at Ryoka. Nodded ahead at the burning oblivion and tornado growing in the distance.
“Miss Ryoka Griffin. Would you like to speak for a moment? Or is now a bad time?”
Ryoka nearly laughed. It was the same Belavierr. The same—but different. She still didn’t know what to say. She still guessed at being normal. But she was Human. And she looked weary as Ryoka halted.
“I can stop for a moment. But I’ve got a date with the fire.”
“As do we all. You run towards it.”
“Yeah. I guess I think I can do something about it. Why’re you here? I thought you left.”
“I have not decided yet. My death comes. But my daughter stays. So I wait. I am wondering. If.”
“If?”
Belavierr’s eyes glinted.
“If I should take her by force. If I can avoid my death.”
Ryoka glanced at the tornado. It hadn’t grown larger. So she hesitated. Gestured back towards Riverfarm.
“You seem certain. Aren’t there a lot of ways you survive?”
Belavierr shook her head.
“No. My death is fairly certain. I have seen it. I wove the tapestry with a [String of Fate], that I might see my deaths. And I saw the [Knight] and fire. This is the second of my deaths.”
“Yeah, but you could leave—you don’t have to stay for Wiskeria’s sake. Or abduct her.”
The [Witch] sighed. Loudly. She glanced up at Ryoka again.
“If it was that easily avoided, it would not be my death. I know myself, Ryoka Griffin. So long as my daughter remains, I do too. I only wonder if my death would save her. Or if there is a way to escape it. The last time took the death of a man. A traitor’s choice. And my immortality. This time I have neither to give.”
She stared at the fire in the distance. Ryoka looked at it. But—she still had time. So she walked over to Belavierr. She looked at the Stitch Witch. Belavierr glanced at her. She was holding threads in her fingers. Was she playing some…convoluted game of cat’s cradle? It looked like it, with threads as thin as hair. She noticed Ryoka staring at it and the threads vanished into one sleeve. Belavierr paused, looking at the City Runner.
“Tell me, something. Once, before, you called yourself my daughter’s friend. And you proposed to help us reconcile. How did you intend to do that, Ryoka Griffin? Or was that a lie?”
Ryoka shrugged her eyes on the fire. It had slowed down, definitely.
“I had a plan. I was going to get you to do some magic with Wiskeria. Something positive. Like—making more charms. She’d have to help you, and maybe learn something. And you’d show her you could do good. I thought that was worth a try. I mean, I know I’m not an expert. But no one else was trying to help.”
“Hm. Strange.”
“What is?”
“You. Few people wish to aid me. My daughter has told me she hates me. What makes you wish to help me?”
The young woman hesitated. She sat down across from Belavierr, keeping one eye on the fire.
