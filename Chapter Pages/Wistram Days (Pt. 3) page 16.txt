Wistram Days (Pt. 3)
Page 16
Both students laughed as they went back to Pisces’ room. There they pulled out the spellbook and stared at it. Ceria wanted to learn another combat spell, and Pisces was still staring at one spell he claimed to half-understand already. After a while, Pisces spoke.
“They’re betting on us.”
Ceria raised her head with a frown.
“Who are?”
“Beatrice and Calvaron. I heard they’ve put money that both of us will pass the exams.”
“People bet on who’ll pass? Wait, of course they do.”
Ceria sighed. She felt annoyed that Calvaron and Beatrice were treating her getting into Wistram so trivially, but Pisces took the opposite view. He smiled at her.
“Don’t be angry. If they didn’t like us or care they wouldn’t have made the bet. I think they’re trying to help us. They give us tips and secrets for free all the time, don’t they?”
“I guess. It’s just—we’re going to need more than a bit of help if we want to be sure we’ll pass.”
Ceria sighed, dispirited. Pisces raised his eyebrows and tapped the book in front of them.
“That’s what this is for. Look here—I’m certain this spell is in fact [Flash Step]. I had to get to one of the encyclopedias to look it up, but the spell’s description seems to match this spell exactly!”
Filled with sudden interest, Ceria peered at the spell. She nodded.
“You could be right!”
Then her face fell.
“But there’s only three weeks left until the exams. Not enough time for either of us to learn it.”
“I think I can do it. At the very least, I want to try.”
Ceria stared at Pisces. She knew he was smart. But this? [Flash Step] was a Tier 3 spell.
“You’re going to try?”
“Of course. And you can learn [Stone Fist] as well. If we work together, we’ll pass the exams.”
Pisces grinned at her. Ceria felt her heart pounding in her chest. Just heard it. She smiled at Pisces, and held up a fist for him to bump his cautiously against.
“Definitely.”
