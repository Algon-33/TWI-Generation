He brushed past her. Jelaqua half-grabbed for him, and then gave up. Numbtongue reached the door. He found it was barred. He took off the door bar, flung open the door.
And he stopped.
Mud covered the Floodplains. Mud and water. The rains were gone. The grasses dead. It was just mud, as far as the eye could see. Mud, water.
And Goblins.
There they lay. Green bodies. Goblins wearing black armor. Carn Wolves, dotting the ground. Dead. They covered a small part of the Floodplains, really. A large battlefield and then—a stream of bodies fallen as they’d fled towards Liscor. And then broken north, towards the mountains. Dead bodies.
And the undead. They roamed the hills and valleys, sometimes falling, crawling, standing. Lifeless faces, already rotting. Goblins.
Part of Numbtongue wasn’t surprised. Part of him, a dreadful part, wasn’t even shocked by the sight. He was a warrior. He knew what to expect. But the rest of him…hurt.
Just hurt. And Numbtongue was ashamed beyond belief that it didn’t hurt more. But it couldn’t. Seven days had passed. A week. He knew what had happened.
They were dead. He was alive. That was all there was to it.
“Numbtongue?”
The Hobgoblin turned. He saw Lyonette standing in the doorway. The others were standing behind him, staring at Numbtongue or away. None of them knew what to say. As if what they could say mattered. Numbtongue looked at them. Then he walked back inside.
“Uh—”
“Erin.”
The Goblin looked at Lyonette. She blinked and hesitated.
“She’s upstairs. But—”
Numbtongue strode towards the stairs. Anxiously, Lyonette followed him. The Hobgoblin nearly tripped going up the stairs and had to catch the handrail to steady himself. His stomach rumbled. He pushed himself up and ignored Lyonette. He had to see her. He had to know. Was she—
She was there. In the room. Curled up. Weeping silently. Numbtongue stared at her and sagged against the doorframe in relief. She was alive. That was all. They’d done it. They’d—
There was no satisfaction. Erin was alive, but Headscratcher was dead. So was Shorthilt. Rabbiteater and Badarrow? The Cave Goblins were dead. They were all gone. It wasn’t enough. And that was a bitter truth for Numbtongue.
But she was still here. Numbtongue stumbled forwards. Erin didn’t respond, even though she had surely heard him come in.
For a second Numbtongue just looked down at her. He looked at her tears. And he clenched his hand into a fist. And for the first time, the numbness in him began to shift.
“Erin.”
She reacted to the sound of his voice. Erin turned. Slowly. Her eyes widened when she saw him.
“Numb…?”
She coughed. Uncurled painfully. Sat up. She tried to stand and pushed herself up from the mattress. She stood up, wobbling like Numbtongue. She looked at him. And her eyes overflowed.
She’d been crying. But—Numbtongue noticed—Erin’s cheeks weren’t wet. Her eyes were red, but she hadn’t been crying. She was now.
“Numbtongue.”
Erin stepped towards Numbtongue. She halted.
“I’m so sorry. I’m so—so sorry.”
Numbtongue felt a shock run through him. He looked at Erin. She was crying now. But all he felt was anger.
“Why?”
It surprised her. For a second Erin’s tears stopped. She gulped.
“Because I did it. I asked you to—I did this. I’m so sorry. I should never have—”
She broke up, wiping her face. Numbtongue stared at her. He looked at his hands. At his chest. And he was angry.
“We chose to stay. We fought. And we died. This was our choice. Not yours.”
“But I asked—”
Erin wiped at her eyes.
“I’m—I’m sorry. I know you chose. But all of them. Headscratcher. And Shorthilt and…so many.”
