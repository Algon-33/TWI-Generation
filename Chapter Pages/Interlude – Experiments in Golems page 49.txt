Interlude – Experiments in Golems
Page 49
“Too long has it been since I wove minds like I did flesh. I grew complacent in Terandria. In immortality. My bindings came undone. This time—a grander web. Finer thread. Can’t you feel it moving? The world is changing again.”
She pointed at something Az’kerash could not see. But he heard it, later.

Nsiia stood in front of Domehead. The Crafter-Magus had become something, in that moment. Illivere would not be the same.
He had no voice. He was not…Cognita. But look at him. She lifted Yinah, and the cat rested on the flashing dome. And Domehead looked at her. Nsiia smiled.
“So that’s what he sees.”
It was never boring around Femithain, either.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: We’re back! That’s a lotta words. Have you missed these long chapters? I have the stamina for them after my break.
Does it mean it’s a good? No, not necessarily. But I had a lot to say about Golems. And it does matter. Femithain’s chapter is one of the ones which has to get written. But since you voted for it—I took more time in telling it.
It’s always a give and take. Anyways, I’m off my break! I think you can tell it reenergized me. These monthly breaks add to the quality of the story. I could still use more time off. But time…time is unforgiving! We have to take breaks and work hard.
Anyways. This was fun and I’m glad to be writing again! I’m very hungry, though, so while I take a break I’ll leave you with some wonderful art! Hope you liked the chapter and see you next time!
Today’s art is by Cortz and Artsynada, who have done a LOT of amazing art since the last time they were featured! I often show it on the Twitch stream, but like the others, it builds up for After-Chapter comments! They’re also doing Inktober with AuspiciousOctopi, so I’ll try to feature their art too!
Also, we have an [Innkeeper] and [Skeleton] Juliette Taka! I thought it was appropriate! Undead are like Golems, right? Right? No one kill me.
