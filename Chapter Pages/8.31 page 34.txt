…14 hours later, I ‘fixed’ it. My computer is a mess. All my files are there; nothing’s in the right place. Windows in its infinite wisdom deleted my Office files and replaced it with Microsoft 365, the most disgusting program I’ve ever seen.
I’m now using a new word program…that has none of my dictionary terms and keeps formatting my dialogue ‘properly’ by cramming it onto the same line.
I hate it all. I have written easier chapters while sick, injured, and with less than 4 hours of sleep.
Anyways, I was never in danger of losing key files; most everything is backed up including notes. I’m not a complete fool, but while I could have used a backup laptop or something, my computer is my setup and organization. It’s like…I could work from another room instead of my office, but I’m working in another room while watching my office burn down.
The point is the edited chapter is delayed. Blame Microsoft. I do. This chapter is probably shorter since I lost an entire day to technical issues. Bleh. Someone uncurse me.
