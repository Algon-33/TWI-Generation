“Like Tremborag?”
Rags sneered. But Ulvama did not. She looked longingly back north. Tremborag’s mountain wasn’t even in view, but the other Goblins did too.
“Stupid.”
The little Chieftain informed Ulvama. She got a glare in return.
“How do you know? That was our tribe. You didn’t know it.”
“Saw enough. You did bad things.”
“So what? They did bad things to us.”
Ulvama snapped at Rags. She took a deep breath.
“You don’t know. You don’t know me. We were happy there. Sex, food—we had what we wanted. Tremborag was great Chieftain. Humans deserve pain. We do bad things to them? I am Human and Goblin.”
“You mean, parents were…”
Rags stared at Ulvama. The Goblin glared at her.
“Mother was Goblin.”
“Oh.”
The other Goblins stared at her. Pyrite just sighed. Rags searched for a comeback. There wasn’t one, really. But it still didn’t change the things Tremborag’s tribe had done. It changed nothing—but it explained everything. She shook her head.
“Still. Still.”
“You don’t know.”
Ulvama looked down at the ground. Rags glared.
“I do. My parents die too. Big Drake—Relc—kill them. Cut off heads. For present.”
The other Goblins looked at her. Rags told the story of how she had thrown rocks at Erin, trying to get some food. And then how the Drake had hunted her parents down, leaving only her alive. And then—
“—And then, he give to Erin. To her. But she didn’t like.”
“Didn’t like the present?”
Pyrite and Ulvama stared at her. Rags nodded. The two looked at each other, and then they and the other Goblins all burst out laughing. They roared with laughter, and Rags did too. They had to laugh at that story. It was laugh or cry. Or curl up and stop moving.
They went onwards. Following the Humans, telling stories. Tragic stories, happy ones. The happy ones were so rare, but Rags had more than her fair share. At one point she caught Ulvama looking at her. It was strange, but she and the [Shaman] did get along. True, Ulvama flirted outrageously with Pyrite in ways even Rags could pick up on, but they were…alike. In ways that Rags hadn’t known until now. It was actually pleasant to walk with her. She wasn’t an enemy.
“What?”
“When you said Goblins live in circles, what did you mean?”
The little Goblin scratched her head uncomfortably.
“What I said. Goblins live in circles. We kill Humans. Humans kill us. Repeat. Bad thing. Can’t keep doing.”
Tremborag’s Goblins exchanged glances and nodded, losing their cheer. They had seen the end of their circle in Tremborag. And yet—Ulvama shook her head.
“But what do we do? If Humans kill Goblins, what can we do? What other way is there? We run and die? We fight and run? We are hunted always.”
“I know. But there must be other way. There must. Or circle always comes around.”
Rags insisted. She didn’t have the answer, but she knew it was true. After a second, Ulvama nodded.
“So Chieftain is looking for something else? Something that is not circle?”
“Yes. Like square.”
“Or triangle?”
A Hob suggested. Another smacked him on the shoulder.
“Squiggly thing better.”
“How about line?”
Rags grinned, and she caught Pyrite smiling. They looked at each other, walking along, and for a second they forgot they were marching after the Humans, after Reiss, that they had lost their tribe. Then they heard a howl and looked ahead.
