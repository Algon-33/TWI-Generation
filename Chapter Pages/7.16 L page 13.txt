But here was Lyonette’s second friend in Liscor. She had two, by the way. Which was good. And Zevara was a contrast to Krshia. She was almost always at work. And she was strict, always assessing herself. Also—
“How’s your breathing these days?”
“Hm? Fine. That tonic that the Centaur, Palt, gave me, works well. I had to force the payment on him. Damn [Mages]. As bad as Terandrians with bribes. Stop pushing the plate towards me. I’ll have a tart if I want one.”
—She didn’t do small-talk well. But that was refreshing too. If Lyonette longed for someone she could look up to, respect, she also liked straight-talkers. She mentally reset herself.
“Right, sorry. So—anything new at work?”
Zevara stopped. And she abruptly put down the report she was looking over. And her face was grave. Serious.
“Yes. Bearclaw. I told you about the rumors about her last week?”
Lyonette’s smile wavered.
“Yes. What happened?”
Watch Captain Zevara paused. She looked at Lyonette, then cursed.
“Ancestors damn it. What’s in those tarts?”
“Peaches. Sugar. Why…?”
The Watch Captain grabbed the plate. Then she reached back, and came out with a bottle. And two shot glasses. She poured the Firebreath Whiskey into both.
“Here. It’s all I’ve got.”
She shoved a glass towards Lyonette. The [Princess] stared. This was unusual.
“Zevara?”
The Drake glared.
“If you’re tempting me, I’ll have some. And I’m also having a drink.”
“Isn’t that, um…discouraged on duty, Watch Captain?”
Lyonette had been teasing Zevara, but that was an unspoken game they played. The Watch Captain had never taken the bait like this before. But Zevara just grunted as she lifted the glass to her lips.
“It’s that or ordering the entire Watch to get out there, arrest Bearclaw, Mister Soot, and every gang member in the city and toss them into the dungeon. Or just find a long enough length of rope.”
“What happened?”
“Two Senior Guards are dead. Their bodies were found two days ago. I haven’t told anyone, but word is spreading. We knew they were missing for a week. But we only found their…remains now. 4th Company was clearing out a Shield Spider nest. They found the badges.”
The glass paused at Lyonette’s lips. The [Princess] felt cold.
“…Bearclaw?”
“Yes. I know it’s her. But—we hauled her in for questioning again. That Ancestors-damned—that slippery—she was smoking a cigar the entire time. And she lied. To our faces.”
Zevara slammed down a drink, filled her glass, and took another shot. Lyonette looked at her.
“How? I thought you told me Klbkch and Relc were investigating her—”
“They were. But remember the time when I had to put Relc in the inn?”
“No—”
“Yes. We put a second pair on her. They vanished within their two hour reconnaissance period.”
“But how? Did she…?”
“I. Don’t. Know. Best guess is that she ambushed them. They were new Senior Guards. But they were good. Just…Sheikhe and Laven. I notified their families yesterday. But we couldn’t get Bearclaw.”
“Why? You used truth spells…”
Zevara caught herself in filling the glass a fourth time. She grabbed a tart and ate furiously.
“Of course! But she evaded the spells. Told us to our faces she’d never even seen them. And she didn’t know where they died. If I could, I’d throw her in jail until she rots. But the law says I can do nothing but investigate. And I know she did it. Somehow, she lied. Twice now, that’s happened with our truth stones. This is good.”
“Thanks.”
Zevara didn’t make Lyonette feel as good about the world as Krshia. The Watch Captain went on.
“Serious criminals. First Regrika Blackpaw, now…it doesn’t help they’re Gnolls.”
“How so?”
