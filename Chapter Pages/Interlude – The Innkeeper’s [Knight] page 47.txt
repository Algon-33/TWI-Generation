Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 47
Parts might be weaker for having to combine both storylines. But it was literally 2 votes of difference and I thought both side stories were too good to pass up!
Did I fail? Did I succeed? I hope you enjoy. I might take off two weeks after December, just so you know. For the New Year! Call it my Christmas present! I’m warning you in advance!
But I’ll get to more later. Rabbiteater’s levels, more consequences, more story! Until then—I’m going to rest. Whew! Ambition. That’s my downfall. Ambition.
Thanks for reading!
 
The art for this chapter is by ArtsyNada who has a very pertinent image, and a scarf!, Brosciple of Brodin (is that right?) who’s done AMAZING Antinium, Toren, and a young Badarrow, and…Pie. Who has done an accurate Mrsha and Lyonette interaction. Give them all laudations! Is that word right?
