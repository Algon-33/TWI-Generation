The [Mage] shuddered. He thought he knew Fierre. But he had never seen the look in her eyes. He nodded, relaying the [Message]. Fierre stared down at the parchment she held. It held a [Message] or rather, a report she’d obtained for Ryoka. The [Broker] in Filk had one too. And he knew where the [Witches] were. But that wasn’t the problem.
“Leave a [Message] for Ryoka at Filk’s Runner’s Guild. Mark it as priority. I’ll pay you. Got it?”
She was too panicked to care. The rattled [Mage] sent the [Message] and Fierre stormed out of the room. She hesitated after she slammed the door, but there was nothing more she could do. Short of trying to run to Filk herself. And it was too late for that. All she could do was lean on the man in Filk. And pray Ryoka ran for it as soon as she got the [Message].
Fierre hurried back to The Huntress’ Haven, her home away from home. Madain looked up from his usually empty inn and grinned.
“You sort out that thing with Ryoka yet? Where is that idiot Runner?”
“In Riverfarm.”
“Where the hell’s that?”
Fierre was too rattled to respond. She only pulled out the report.
“I got this—”
Madain’s eyebrows rose. He knew of her profession of course. Anyone who wanted to could find out. He sauntered over carelessly.
“Got herself into some trouble, has she? What’s that, then? Hey! [Fist Fighter], look at this.”
Alber looked up from his cold meal. He thought about it, and then got up. Fierre held out the parchment shakily.
“It’s someone in Riverfarm. A [Witch]. Ryoka wanted to find her record. This is it.”
“Ooh. A criminal? Scary. You know, I have a bounty.”
“Not like this one.”
Fierre promised Madain. The former adventurer laughed contemptuously.
“Hah! How bad could it be? What’s Ryoka gotten herself tangled up—oh.”
His laughter cut off abruptly. Alber frowned as he came over to see. He looked at Fierre and then peered over Madain’s shoulder. His eyes widened. Fierre slowly took the parchment back from Madain. He stared at her along with Alber.
“Is that real?”
“Oh yes.”
It hadn’t even been hard to get. It was, after all, a public record. And if she knew—Fierre didn’t know how Ryoka had met her and she didn’t care. She just wanted Ryoka to run. Before it was too late. Slowly, she read the list of charges attached to the file.
Murder. Kidnapping. Torture. Injury of a royal. Unlawful use of dark magic. Theft. Murder of a child. Extortion. Murder of a [Knight]. Murder of a [Guardsman]. Destruction of a city. Mass murder. Mutilation. Murder of a [Prince]. Freeing imprisoned slaves. Murder of a [Slaver]. Murder of a [Mage]. Seduction of a [Prince] (unconfirmed). Destruction of a village (uncomfirmed) and mass murder via hanging. Summoning of an unknown; mass deaths by unknown. Creation of monsters. Bribery—
The list of crimes ran on and on. Fierre had seen criminal charges for members of the Bloodfeast Raiders that were shorter than this! At last, her eyes went back to the top of the page. She read out loud in the silent inn.
“The Stitch Witch, Belavierr. Wanted in Terandria. Currently being pursued by the Guild of Hunters, and the Order of Seasons. Believed to be in Izril. Current bounty…eighteen thousand total gold pieces. In Terandria. Twenty thousand pieces. From the Slavers of Roshal. Three thousand gold by Wistram…”
