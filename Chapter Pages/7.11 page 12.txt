“Oh? Well, they’re twice as tricky in the water. But er, how many did you run into?”
“Thousands.”
Wailant stared. There was nothing for it but for Numbtongue to relate the battle at the inn. When he was done, Viceria laughed.
“Have you done that, Wailant? I think one of your guests has finally told a better tale than a fine seadog.”
“Argh. Do you have to rub it in?”
“Yes, and relentlessly. Wailant loves telling his sea tales, thank you for taking him down a peg.”
The [Green Mage] winked at Numbtongue. He bared his teeth.
“What about your stories?”
Viceria blinked and both she and Wailant laughed.
“I am poor at fighting. The second monster I ever ran into outside of Wistram nearly killed me. It did kill my entire escort, until Wailant saved me. I rather think I’m three times as good at actual combat as I was before we met. There’s a world of difference from learning to cast combat spells in Wistram to seeing an actual monster.”
“That’s how we met, by the by. I saved her, and we got to talking. Among other things.”
Wailant grinned at Numbtongue. The Hobgoblin saw his wife roll her eyes. He thought he liked Wailant, a bit. The man was sort of Garen-like. Overbearing, but in a good way to his friends. The [Pirate]/[Farmer] had to recount the story of how he had persuaded Viceria to stay with him, and how she had made his farming venture an actual success.
“Get yourself a lady like I did, Hobgoblin. It’s the only way to live.”
Wailant finished with that sage advice. Numbtongue almost caught himself nodding. Viceria put her hands on her hips.
“And why is it his job and yours to get a woman, Wailant? Can’t we choose?”
The husband laughed, his face flushed with drink.
“Not a chance! Because no lady’d choose one of us, right, Numbtongue?”
He grinned. And Viceria and Numbtongue both burst out laughing. Viceria leaned over.
“Tell me, Numbtongue. I’ve heard Goblins have [Shamans]. Have you ever seen them casting higher-level magics?”
“Here we go. Magic talk. Don’t let her ask you about spells or you’ll talk your mouth off.”
Wailant reached for the wine bottle, found it was empty, and got up. Numbtongue was explaining that the Redfangs hadn’t had many Goblin [Shamans]—a few, but they had died in battle as often as the [Warriors]. Viceria sighed.
“A shame. I was studying different types of green magic. That’s my specialty, incidentally. As a [Green Mage], I wanted to visit Oteslia. Well, I ended up here and I don’t regret it. I had a life of academia ahead of me, and I was rather sheltered—I grew up in Wistram, you know. Most [Mages] do and it leaves us sheltered.”
“Sheltered is better than unsheltered.”
Numbtongue opined. Viceria glanced at him.
“Yes, well, I suppose it is. But we tend to die in accidents, or underestimating our enemies when we leave the academy. I imagine that’s quite amusing to Goblins.”
“A bit. Redfangs…hunt [Mages]. Sort of easy.”
The [Bard] coughed. Viceria glanced at him.
“How so?”
“If we see robes, we run away. [Mages] chase. Forget to put barriers. So then a [Rogue] or [Archer]…sorry.”
Numbtongue gestured, embarrassed. Viceria shrugged.
“I imagine many Wistram [Mages] have it coming. It is an ongoing conflict. But that’s rather disheartening. What happens if a [Mage] is wise enough to keep their barrier up?”
“Run away. Shoot arrows from afar. [Mages] get tired. Have trouble hitting Goblins with [Fireballs], Lightning is the worst.”
The Hobgoblin scowled. Viceria nodded.
