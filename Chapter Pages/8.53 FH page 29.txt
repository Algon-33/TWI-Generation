Omusc led Ceria to a Mage’s Guild that looked like any other. It was fairly well-swept, although the influx of visitors kept it a bit dirty and wet from the harbor, but it was hardly overflowing with rats, and there was even a [Receptionist] at the counter. Everything was the same—until a mage emerged from the back.
“Yeah? Well, why doesn’t the Siren cast her bloody spells herself? Forgotten how to do [Message]?”
He was smoking a huge blunt of dreamleaf, but aside from that, he didn’t have any notab—
The [Mage] poured himself a glass of low-quality wine, and offered one to Omusc. She took a swig.
“Gah. Dead gods, you drink that stuff?”
“Look at you fancy palace-lot. Most of the customers don’t even get wine—or special deals. Is this your fancy guest? Alright, let’s deal with whatever she has. Who am I sending to?”
The [Mage] sneered at Ceria. If anything, the [Bandits], [Pirates], [Raiders], and honest sailors seemed to regard Ceria’s clean robes as something of a provocation.
“She’s a Gold-rank adventurer.”
Omusc said it with no lack of irony. The [Mage] snorted, eying Ceria.
“One who can’t cast [Message]?”
“I can cast [Message]. I just don’t have the range—”
“A Gold-rank [Mage] who can’t cross-continent [Message]. Tsk, tsk.”
Some of the others in line were enjoying the show. Ceria looked around. So this was how it was? She sighed and lifted a cup of wine to her lips.
“Fine. I get it. Can I just get some help or what?”
The [Mage] and Omusc eyed her. Ceria gulped the wine down.
“…What? Tree rot, this is bad stuff.”
The [Mage]’s lips quirked. He took the blunt out of his mouth, fished in his pocket, and offered Omusc and Ceria something.
“Want a puff? Special for the Siren’s friends.”
Omusc waved away the Dreamleaf rollup.
“We’re n—”
“Sure.”
Ceria lit the tip, took a puff, and went cross eyed.
“Wait. This is way stronger than Palt’s stuff. You drink and smoke Dreamleaf?”
“It’s…an acquired taste. And you’re clearly a [Mage] of culture.”
The Savereian [Mage] blinked at Ceria. She snorted in derisive amusement.
“It’s not my hobby, but I was in Wistram.”
“Aaaaah. They still throw massive parties over there? I hear about them sometimes. Ordering ten pounds of Dreamleaf and lighting it up in a single room?”
“…Sounds about right. I never went to them myself, but—”
Omusc stared at Ceria as she began swapping stories with the [Mage] about the things Wistram [Mages] got up to. Which, yes, in a subsection of their student and adult population, included ingesting any number of illicit substances through any orifice possible and a few that weren’t.
Omusc leaned over and glared covertly with one eye at the figure lurking in line. Are you sure she needs corrupting?
The most basic, overt plays were clearly not going to work, so they were abandoned and a deeper strategy employed. Meanwhile, any number of people entered the Mage’s Guild, mostly to see Ceria sitting at one of the tables as the [Mage] got to work.
“…No dead names from either Griffon Hunt or the Halfseekers. Confirmed. Here’s your recording of the battle. Just start playing it.”
He placed a crystal on the table. Ceria got to watch the actual battle as the world had seen it of the Village of the Dead, and Omusc got to watch her reaction to it.
“Dead gods! Ryoka! I forgot! She brought an entire army—is that Tyrion Veltras?”
Ceria exclaimed. Omusc leaned in as Ceria started swearing—she saw the teleporting undead trap, the way the undead began pressing the Gold-ranks.
“Where were you in all this?”
“On that.”
