Solstice (Pt. 2)

“There was no other day I could have arrived.”
Tamaroth said simply. Laughter in his tone. Laken frowned.
What are you?
He wanted to ask. But he didn’t.
Couldn’t?
Instead, he switched topics.
“You said you and I are linked. That one other had found…a friend.”
“More than a friend, Laken Godart. We two are of the same kind. Leaders of men.”
“And women. And half-Trolls, [Witches], Goblins. Or is it just men?”
The figure shifted again. He sounded both amused and annoyed.
“What pedantic words you choose. You know what I mean. You should rejoice that I chose you.”
“Yet I did not choose you. I rather feel I’ve been tricked.”
Laken shot back. He paced back and forth. Yet not once did he confirm the man was there. Nor did he try to leave the room. He whirled.
“You took my hand.”
“You tricked me.”
Then. Laken Godart remembered it. For some reason, Durene and Gamel had not come to the door. He had been wandering around, trying to find something in the unfamiliar room.
“Is anyone there?”
And he had reached out, after falling and—
“I was a blind man, reaching out for my cane. For something to grab. I did not intend to seal a pact with you, Tamaroth.”
“Intention. You sound like him. Quibbling over words, details, the meaning of each. What matters is that you did.”
“So what have I made a pact with?”
He would not respond. Laken Godart’s hair rose. He threw himself back into his chair. This was not then. He was on his land.
“Why did you come? Just to dispense more advice? I will take that. Then you may show yourself out. And never return.”
He tried to enforce his will. But he felt nothing. Tamaroth laughed.
“After today? You and I will speak more. I came to you, my friend, to speak of your future. What you should do.”
“I will consider your words. But I am not your subject.”
“Are you not?”
The two faced each other, in a silent battle of wills. After a moment—the other relented.
“Let us not quarrel. Today is a day of great rejoicing. I hear the outsiders making merry. You should not have invited them. Make your festivities in my name. I told you to do so. It has been too long since I enjoyed any such delights. Have you nothing to drink here? To eat? Offer me something. I am parched of thirst. Starved of sustenance.”
A note of reproach. Laken decided he should have invited the entire realm of the fae in that case. He leaned forwards, tapping his cane on the ground.
“If you want to eat or drink, help yourself. I’m sure the kitchen’s larder is stocked. Or go outside and ask to join in the festivities. I’m sure the fae will be interested in you.”
“I will not.”
The voice was angered. Laken pushed on. He stood.
“Why don’t I ask them for you? I’m sure Ryoka would be interested in you.”
“You will not.”
Laken strode towards the door. He halted, his hand on the doorknob. He looked back once.
“What are you doing to me?”
“You will not. Sit back down.”
Laken stepped away from the door. He felt another sensation on his skin. Slowly, he walked back.
“I have never thought of doing violence to someone—at least not seriously. A blind man is a poor opponent even for a child. And yet—I still do not now.”
“Laken Godart. Must we be enemies?”
“I prefer my allies to be honest. Men like Lord Yitton Byres or Lord Gralton Radivaek are better allies to me. Even Lord Tyrion Veltras.”
“Fine men. Lesser men. It seems our natures are too alike. I have ever chosen such. But a lesser man would not be worthy of me. Rejoice, Laken Godart. Rejoice that you and I do not find each other easy company. And listen to my wisdom, for it will aid you.”
