“Some things lie to the south and east. Old, dead places. Sunken land. Yes, though…little. Perhaps Rhir?”
A voice. The other ghosts looked up and beheld a vast, winged form.
Xarkouth. The Dragonlord of the Void. He folded his wings, ready to breathe the element of the void itself in defense of all there. He glanced up, nodding at the Giant holding the umbrella, a [Queen] armed with the sword that shone even here.
Yet…
A Wyrm who had traveled far scoffed at the Void dragon.
“Do you forget basic geography, oh wise Dragonlord? Rhir lies north. North and west of Chandrar!”
Xarkouth stared at Rhisveri’s brother steadily. Until the Wyrm’s sneering look grew contemptuous. The Dragon spoke for all present, though some ghosts knew what he would say already.
“Rhir can be reached from the south. From every direction, if you fly and know the shape of all. Though the route is treacherous and you must skirt the place where even Dragons do not fly.”
“South? That is impossible. To the south lies only…”
The Wyrm trailed off. Califor nodded. She adjusted her hat as another secret of this world was revealed. Too late.
Erin saw the ghosts whispering and looked about.
“What are we looking at? Califor? Khelta?”
The [Necromancer]-[Queen] stared east.
“I can think of only one thing. It runs this world’s seam. The place where water ends. The place no one dares go, where magic twists and Dragons do not fly.”
Gerial whispered.
“The place where worse than Demons lie.”
Erin looked around. Then ahead. Towards the horizon, that flat, perfect line across the world…or did it curve? You couldn’t tell the distance. But at the edge, unlike Earth—lay an end to it all. They called it…
The Last Tide.
The end of the world. How it had been, for all of living memory. But not all of dead memory. And now…and now…
 
——
 
The five felt it. They drifted across the ocean, further than the ghosts hiding at the borders of their land.
“It cannot be. You said it was dead.”
They were bickering. The two, the huntress and dancing man, defended themselves.
“We saw it fall.”
“It must be dead. Even it.”
“If it is not? It is not of us. Norechl—”
“Shh!”
That name, like a drop of black ink in a glass of water…
Spread. Across the void. The five hushed. They looked at each other and felt it. They drifted further.
No matter where you went, you would eventually find it. The end of the world. So the ghosts looked, straining their eyes. Staring ahead.
For what? They did not know, only that it was there.
From Baleros to Terandria. The ghosts looked into the void. From Drath. Ghosts and dead things. Staring…staring…waiting.
But not for long.
It.
Was.
Time.
 
——
 
Then Erin saw it. At first, she didn’t believe it. Like a trick of the eyes, or the light. Yet there was no light or eyes to trick that far away.
“Does…does anyone see that?”
She pointed. The ghosts were silent. Nerrhavia whispered.
“I see it. I see…a face.”
Xarkouth’s wings flapped. He inhaled—hesitated, and then swallowed the fire. For they were so far.
“That—that is not a face. That is a head.”
The Wyrm’s eyes opened wide.
“That is no head. Is it a body?”
Gerial was shuddering.
“Is it alive? What—what is—it’s an Old One.”
Khelta gripped the memory of a weapon in her hand.
“No. That is not an Old One.”
Cawe was shivering so hard she couldn’t speak, but Elucina, the Rebel of String, murmured.
“It looks like A’ctelios—”
“No.”
Again, a voice spoke, and it was one of the [Witches]. She turned her head.
