Stories. The fae applauded—but no one else dared do the same. The last warrior advanced. And his armor was made of bone. His face—if it was a he—invisible behind the ivory bars covering it.
Ryoka Griffin faced him. She would never get into the air without getting past him. And no one else had challenged him.
A War Golem lumbered forwards. The bone warrior raised an axe and cut it in two. The Terlands gasped. It didn’t even slow the figure one beat.
Ryoka looked around for a weapon. Her eyes alighted on…
A piece of corn. Someone was offering it to her.
“Um. Not the weapon I wanted.”
She looked at the figure holding it. The man smiled.
“I know. I have only ever tasted corn this good once before. Do you know my friend?”
Ryoka’s eyes widened. She stared up at him. The magnificent armor he wore.
“Lupp?”
“That’s him. Well then. I challenge you.”
The man walked past Ryoka. And the warrior of bone put up his axe. He saluted, and the man saluted back. Ryoka stumbled back. Ulva Terland looked past the Wind Runner, at one of her bodyguards. Her escort.
They changed his name. Ryoka remembered Lupp’s words.
An unhappy [Farmer]. Grew beets. One day—
“Eldertuin Terland. I challenge you.”
The Named Adventurer saluted his opponent. He carried a mace—and a tower shield. He was nearly Durene’s size!
Eldertuin the Fortress.
Eldert.
Lupp’s friend.
 
“Corn! Corn and challenges! What disappointment! What delight! Hah!”
 
The fae were hooting. Ryoka jumped—and went flying into a table. The wind was twisting. Dozens of fae were trying to make it throw her—or helping and not helping.
She just had to—Ryoka yanked a tablecloth off a table, taking all the dishes with it. She threw it around herself. The wind blew—she went up—
 
“Enough!”
 
The wind went still. Even it feared the voice. Ryoka landed in a heap. She got up, and Melidore was striding towards her.
He had a blade in hand.
“Oh come on. You too?”
She pointed at him. He bared his teeth as they glinted in the fading light.
“You have offended me with your boon, Ryoka Griffin. Why should I not?”
He lifted the sword. And Ryoka felt the wind forsake her. Despairing, she looked around.
“Challenge.”
Melidore blinked. He looked around. A young man was striding towards him, silver armor gleaming, sword and shield in hand.
“Ylawes, no.”
“I challenge you, sir.”
“Me?”
The fae looked amused. He pointed and Ryoka’s feet rooted themselves to the ground. She could not move—could not speak. It was just a gesture. Melidore swung around.
“To a duel. Let her go.”
The first of the guests thought about it. Then he shook his head.
 
“No.”
 
Again, the denial was like a blow. Ylawes caught himself, gritting his teeth. Melidore spread his hands.
“Why should I match blades against a foe who cannot trouble me? I do not defend my honor, or seek the thrill of worthy foes. I only desire to humble Ryoka Griffin. So no. You have nothing to offer me, nor any other. Ryoka Griffin will not leave. Unless…”
His eyes brightened. And a terrible smile came over his face. The other fae seemed to understand what he was thinking. They clapped their hands, chortling.
 
“The bet! The bet of the knight! The tale of green and hubris. Yes, yes!”
 
They cheered Melidore, begging him to do it. He raised a hand and silence fell. Then he looked at Ylawes, the group behind him.
“I will let any one of you strike me, and if I should not be able to reply, the mortal shall go. But if I stand the first blow—I shall strike you. Until one or the other falls.”
