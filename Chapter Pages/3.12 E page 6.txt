My voice cuts through the other noises, bringing quietus with it. I can tell everyone’s stopped to stare at me in astonishment. But I don’t falter. I don’t wait, either. I keep shouting, so that everyone can hear me.
“Riverfarm is under my protection! All those who live within it are part of my empire!”
What’s this? No one understands. Who’s this blind young man, shouting nonsense? They’re just words. Anyone can speak nonsense. Anyone can claim anything they want.
But who has the courage to shout it to the world? I do. So I shout and tell everyone that I am an Emperor, because it is true. I will make it true.
“I am Laken, Emperor of the Unseen! If anyone would challenge me, fight my champion, my [Paladin]. Durene!”
For a few seconds I think the villagers are too shocked to even respond. Then I hear a shout.
“Are you insane?”
Prost’s voice is angry. I can hear him moving towards me, but my attention isn’t on that. It’s on the snow under my feet. And the faint sense I have—
Below me is ice. Below that is timber. And then stone. A wall. And pressed up against that wall is a child. He barely moves, but he does move. He’s trapped against the wall and the snow is so constricting that he can only breathe and move a tiny bit. I see his chest rising and falling in my head.
“What nonsense are you shouting!?”
A hand grabs me. I hear an angry voice, and then more voices.
“You claim our village? By what right?”
“What are you doing?”
“We need help! Stop shouting and—Durene! Come here!”
The villagers have come to me. Of course they would. Here’s this crazy guy shouting at them as they’re in the middle of their grief and desperation. They want to unload their anger onto me. But I’m too busy to care.
“I am an [Emperor].”
They hear me, but who would believe that? They shout at me, and then I hear Durene’s voice.
“Let him go!”
A massive hand moves, and separates Prost from me with ease. He stumbles back, and I hear shouts.
“Durene! Come here!”
“My children are down there! Come with me!”
“You bastard—give me that shovel!”
Screaming. Fighting. Cries for help. I hear it all and see the boy breathing far below. Is this sight? It’s never been so clear to me. I breathe in and out and the world comes into focus.
This is mine. I claim it. It’s not sharp in my head; it’s not my village entirely. But I will have it.
The villagers are fighting. No one will get any work done. I’m angry at them. I know they’re afraid. So am I! But if they can’t work together everyone loses. Durene is shielding me with her body and shouting at them, but she’s no leader. Not yet.
But I am. I am an [Emperor]. I shout.
“Silence!”
And there is. Complete silence. My voice is thunder, and I feel that same sensation in my bones as I did once before, when I shouted at the group of children tormenting Durene, so long ago.
“I am an Emperor.”
My voice is the one sound in the empty world around me. I can feel people staring at me, but they are mute. I keep talking, my voice growing louder.
“Your families, your friends, are all trapped under the snow. I can find them. You will help me. Find something to dig with. We’ll start here. Give Durene her shovel back.”
No one moves. They’re in shock. I don’t have time for it. My hand raises. My voice grows deeper, and it echoes.
“You and you, find something to dig with. You! The shovel! The rest of you, start digging right here. Move!”
They move. They can’t help it. But they want to move as well; I’ve given them purpose. I’ve given them hope. I look down with my head and sense the small body beneath me. Growing colder. Growing weaker.
