He turned and rode. The last of the Redfangs followed him. Redscar found a Goblin fighting with a dagger, his bow broken. He bent and grabbed Badarrow. The Hob fought him. He had been standing over a body. Redscar dragged him away. He left the young woman behind. She was still there, covering the Hob as Redscar fled the field, tears falling like rain.

“Lord Veltras, the Goblins have fled or perished.”
Jericha stated the obvious. Tyrion could see nothing living on the Floodplains. Nothing but humanity. He passed by the Goblin corpses. He stared towards the hill where the Goblin Lord had perished. He frowned.
“The Goblin Lord’s body. I don’t see it. Ensure he is dead. As well as the other one.”
“I will locate their corpses.”
“Good.”
Tyrion Veltras kept staring at the hill. He saw a kneeling figure. A young woman shielded a Hobgoblin’s body. His army had avoided her, as had Tyrion himself. She was, after all, Human.
“My lord?”
“It’s nothing. Aim towards Liscor.”
The words shocked those around Tyrion.
“But the Goblins are dead!”
“So? This changes nothing. Prepare to charge the gates. Tell the trebuchets to launch a single volley. Jericha, a [Siege Fireball]. Destroy those barricades. On my signal.”
Tyrion took a fresh lance. He studied the gates.
“Ready the charge.”
“My lord.”
“What is it?”
Tyrion glanced to one side. Jericha’s voice quavered.
“I—I’ve just received something. A [Message]. From—”
“There is nothing she can say to stop me.”
“Nothing?”
Tyrion whirled. The air opened up in front of him. A smiling face filled the open space. Magnolia Reinhart stared past Tyrion for a second, and then her eyes fixed on him.
“Oh, good. The projection spell worked. Ressa, hold the artifact steady. Hello, Tyrion.”
“Begone, Reinhart!”
Tyrion slashed his lance through the air. The magical spell wavered but didn’t vanish. Magnolia smiled deeper. Her eyes looked past Tyrion at the battlefield. The look in her eyes deepened.
“I see I was too late. Well, I have enough time for this.”
“Whatever you have to say—”
“Be silent, Tyrion. And listen to me. I warned you. I gave you every chance. So this is my ultimatum. Turn back. Leave with the Goblin Lord’s head.”
“And if not? You cannot stop me.”
Magnolia paused. She was filling the image in the screen. But quite deliberately. Jericha trembled as she stared at something past Magnolia. Tyrion stared, but he couldn’t make it out. What was she hiding? The [Lady] sighed.
“No. I suppose I can’t. But I can ensure one thing. If you go through with this, you may take Liscor. And if you do, I will promise you one thing: you will have nothing to come back to.”
“What does that—”
Tyrion’s breath caught as Magnolia moved out of the way. He saw a keep behind her. An old, rather austere structure. Nothing like her estates. But large enough to be called a palace by some. A fortress, moreover. Defensive. A home he knew well.
The Veltras estates. His family home. And Magnolia stood not a hundred feet in front of it. It wouldn’t have mattered if she were anyone else. The keep was a citadel. But she was there.
And she was not alone. The projection jostled as Ressa placed whatever was keeping the recording still on something and stepped forwards. She stood behind her mistress as Magnolia smiled. They stood together. Just the two of them.
“A lovely home.”
That was all Magnolia said. Tyrion’s grip turned white on his lance.
“You dare. If you dare—I will personally ride on you and—”
“Do what? Cross a thousand miles in a moment? No, Tyrion. Be silent.”
And he was. Magnolia looked at him.
