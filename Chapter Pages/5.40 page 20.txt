The adventurers crowded around Bird. Yvlon bent down and heaved with the others. The Face-Eater Moth was surprisingly difficult to lift. It was sodden with blood. When they got it off Bird, they found he really couldn’t move. His left leg was partially crushed. Dried green blood and pieces of his carapace lay around on the ground.
“Ow. Ow. I am much ouch.”
Bird spoke cheerfully, but the way he jerked when Yvlon reached for his leg made it clear how much pain he was in. The woman bent.
“I have a healing potion. Hold still, Bird.”
“Oh. That feels very nice. Thank you, Miss Yvlon.”
Bird relaxed as she poured the healing potion onto his leg. He tried to get up, but still couldn’t. Yvlon caught him.
“Steady. What are you doing down here, Bird?”
He cocked his head at her.
“I am looking for Mrsha, of course. She was taken by the Raskghar. So I went after her. I did not find her. I found many monsters, though. Hello Mister Halrac.”
He waved at Halrac. The [Scout] was staring around at the carnage.
“You did this, Bird?”
The Antinium nodded.
“I had my bow. It is a very good bow because it killed everything. But I ran out of arrows. So I used my knife.”
He waved the knife. Yvlon stared at the Face-Eater Moth corpse. It looked like Bird had hacked its head apart with the knife. She looked at Bird.
“But why? Bird, this is so dangerous!”
Bevussa made a sound. Yvlon turned her head and the Garuda stared pointedly at Yvlon. Bird stared at her.
“Ooh. Pretty.”
“Bird!”
“What? Oh. I did it because Mrsha is missing and it is a bad thing. And I did a bad thing, so I had to do a good thing to make up for it. And because everyone else went.”
His simple explanation confused Yvlon, but Halrac seemed to understand it. The [Scout] knelt and looked at Bird.
“You did this because you wanted to make amends?”
Bird looked up at Halrac. He nodded slowly.
“I am very sorry, Mister Halrac. I did not find Mrsha, but I tried. Did I do bad?”
He quivered. Halrac paused.
“No. Not at all. You did a—a good thing, Bird.”
“Oh. That is very good. I am happy.”
Bird relaxed. Halrac straightened. He looked at Bird and then turned to Bevussa. He looked around and blinked a few times. For the first time, a bit of sanity seemed to enter his vision. Halrac shook his head.
“We’re pulling out for the day. Let’s go. Revi—have your summons carry Bird.”
“At last.”
Bevussa sighed in relief. Yvlon looked at Halrac. She wanted to argue, but when she stared at Bird, she realized how insane this was. They were way too far in the dungeon. The other Gold-ranks were at the entrance. And if there really were hundreds or thousands of Raskghar ahead—
“We’ll get you up. Can you walk, Bird?”
“…Maybe?”
Bird stood up with the help of two adventurers. He hobbled a bit.
“I can walk. Yes, this is good. I will not die like everyone. That would make Erin very sad and I would not like to make her sad again. All the others died and she cried, you know.”
He looked brightly around at the adventurers. Yvlon frowned, but it was Ksmvr who opened his mandibles.
“What do you mean, ‘everyone’, Bird?”
The Antinium Worker tilted his head.
“Everyone, former Prognugator Ksmvr. They are over there. Everyone died. Or most of everyone. I did not see Revalantor Klbkch die, but many others did.”
