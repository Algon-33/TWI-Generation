The little eyes were judging her. Erin was ashamed, because Mrsha looked disappointed. In herself, and the [Innkeeper]. In Erin, who welcomed Goblins. And wouldn’t welcome some people from her world because they weren’t what she wanted.
“Imani.”
The hysterics were fading—at least from screams into sobs. Typhenous cleared his throat.
“Perhaps a [Calm] spell?”
“Yes. Please.”
The old mage walked over. He reached out and Imani flinched. But Typhenous smiled kindly at her.
“This won’t hurt a bit, Miss Imani.”
He touched her head, whispered a word. And Imani relaxed. She still clung to the others. But the worst of her fear—vanished. And Erin Solstice took a breath.
“Sorry. I should have warned you all.”
That was what she said first. She looked at the seven young people.
“It’s just—this was so sudden. I wasn’t sure how to—greet you. But I meant what I said.”
She gestured around the inn.
“We have room. Stay as long as you want. But you do have to know things. About Rock Crabs. And—”
Her eyes darted to Palt, who was muttering about [Calm] spells versus his superior [Remove Fear] spells. Montressa, and Beza, watching them like hawks. Erin looked at the others.
“—there are complications. It’s not always easy. But listen. If you want to stay here, you’re welcome.”
The others looked at each other. And the [Princess] walked forwards. She smiled and nodded.
“That’s right. I don’t know if I’ve done this formally—I’m Lyonette. And this is Mrsha.”
She gestured at the little white Gnoll. And the [Princess] saw something familiar in the young people from Earth too. Like a [Princess] who refused to even take orders. Exasperating, yes. Infuriating? Beyond so. But they were not all the same.
Imani jumped. And then she looked down. A little Gnoll looked up at her apologetically. Not all the same. She nuzzled Imani’s leg. And swatted at Rose’s hand as the young woman tried to pat her on the head.
Youth was failure. Maviola looked at Olesm as he stood on the bridge, afraid to make a mistake again. And she saw his flame guttering. To her—the world was fire. It was her passion, her class.
“Olesm Swifttail. You are a fool.”
He looked at her. And the flames ran lower. But Maviola just drew herself up.
“By that, I mean, you think everything you have came from this Erin Solstice. And that’s why you’re a fool. Because just a moment ago you had a brilliant idea! What fire! What creativity! Yes, it came from other people. Yes, you use their ideas. But so what? No one is entirely original. You just need the daring, the will to try and fail.”
She reached out.
“Try your idea. Show me your determination.”
“But what if I can’t?”
Olesm looked at her. Flinching. Maviola shook her head and her hair blazed. She burned in the daylight, and her triumph shone even under the sun.
“Listen. I’ve failed and triumphed more times than I can count, in equal quantity! And the failure always hurts. But we do not grow, we do not level from never having tried. You have to try. Or you will be the same forever. And—you do not have to do it alone. Few people ever stand alone.”
She reached for his clawed hand.
And a little Gnoll’s paw found Imani’s hand. The young woman started. The [Survivor] looked into another [Survivor]’s eyes. And Mrsha tugged Imani, pointing.
To a magical door. The group of seven started, gasping. Rose looked wide-eyed towards the grass hill. Imani hesitated.
“What is…that?”
She drew back. But Mrsha tugged at her, smiling. Erin looked at her garden.
“That? That’s the [Garden of Sanctuary]. Go on. It’s safe.”
