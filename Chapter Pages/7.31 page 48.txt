Lord Mel was dizzy. Lord Ranga knelt by his side, worried, checking his head.
“I—we are safe, Mel. Lady Bethal, where are we? Might we go home?”
“You’re in Liscor, Lord Ranga. Home is far away. Fortunately, Erin has a magical door connecting to Invrisil. Or—she did. I rather fear it’s broken for the moment.”
The exclamations drew Erin over. She blinked, then smiled at the worried looks—not just on the [Lord]’s faces. The Players of Celum and Veeid and the other Invrisil citizens were alarmed. She waved a hand, laughing.
“Don’t worry. I used a spare mana stone on that door. The door to Veeid’s inn is there. See?”
She opened the door. Everyone relaxed. Then they marveled.
“A magic door! Dead gods! So this is that inn that Reinhart travelled to? And we’re in Liscor? A damn Dr—”
One of the [Lords] caught himself. He saw Relc grinning at him. The Drake blew on his knuckles.
“Say. I can punch anyone I want since I’m getting kicked out…”
He eyed the man. Erin just laughed.
“It’s fine. Liscor is nice to Humans.”
She faltered.
“…Usually. It’s been a kind of sucky day for everyone.”
No one disagreed with that. Well—Pelt might have, but he was gone. Montressa just looked at the [Lords]. She counted minor houses, but some, like Lord Toldos, were known to Wistram. In Erin’s inn.
She wasn’t one to miss the opportunity. Nor—it seemed—was Palt. He was going around, shaking hands, casting [Calm] spells.
“Palt, sir. Pleasure to help. Of course, I couldn’t refuse when I heard—from Wistram. Yes, Ullsinoi. I don’t know if you heard…a steadying smoke? Something stronger? Please, allow me…”
Montressa began doing the same. After a bit, Erin wandered over to the [Lords]. The first person she met was a tall fellow. Almost too skinny.
“Innkeeper Solstice? My name is Lord Alman of House Sanito. I am in your debt. As are we all.”
“Oh. It’s my pleasure. Like I said. I heard you were in trouble. And I had to do something.”
The [Lord] peered at Erin.
“…It’s a rare young woman who would charge a crowd that murderous.”
She laughed as if he’d said a joke.
“Well, that’s just me. We can’t let people be murdered, right?”
“…Surely. May I ask—what this place is? I assume your inn?”
The [Innkeeper] looked around. She smiled broadly.
“Of course! This is The Wandering Inn! Welcome! I forgot to say that! It’s safe here. We have drinks, food—hey Lyonette! Bring over some blue fruit juice and a pizza! That’s good for the nerves, Alman. Can I call you Alman?”
“Er…yes?”
Taken aback, Lord Alman saw a lovely young woman hurry over to him. He was presented with a bow, quite formal, and a cup of blue…liquid…and a triangle of what he was assured was food. He found himself sitting down.
“Is this…what is this, may I ask?”
“Um. Blue fruit juice. It’s sweet. Go on!”
Erin urged the man. Somewhat apprehensive, and hoping this was, in fact, blueberry juice, the man took a sip. His eyes widened.
“How sweet! And this—”
He nibbled at the pizza. The hot food was comforting. Erin beamed.
“Good, right? Here—this is for you.”
She took more drinks from a relieved Gnoll who had found his sister, gave them to Lord Ranga and Mel. The young man just stared at his cup for a while. Lord Ranga blinked and took a sip.
“I—it is sweet! What is this? It’s not blueberry…”
“This is the Amentus fruit.”
Lord Toldos stared into his cup. The old man blinked at the drink. The other [Lords] nearly spat out the drink.
“Amentus wine? Dead gods, that’s expensive!”
“What? No, this isn’t alcoholic…wine?”
Erin looked surprised. Lord Toldos peered at the drink.
