“Gold. Fame. Power. If my daughter asked, I would find it and give it to her. Whatever the cost. Because she is my daughter. But she does not ask. And she never will.”
Ryoka paused. She sat across from Belavierr. She looked at the Stitch Witch.
“Can I have—”
“No.”
“What about a little charm? Like the one you put on Wiskeria…?”
“No. I offer nothing for nothing. My daughter is the one exception.”
Ryoka sighed, staring at the distant fire. Time hung still around the two of them. At last, Belavierr seemed to notice Ryoka’s worry.
“Do you wait for the fire?”
“Yup. I’ve got to do something before it gets to Riverfarm. But it’s not moving closer. Are…are you doing that? Or is that Drake out of wind? It’s still blowing. So why…?”
Ryoka frowned, licking her finger and feeling the air. Belavierr smiled.
“You need not worry. We sit together in an [Immortal Moment].”
Ryoka jumped.
“A—?”
“A useful Skill. I learned the it the last time I leveled up. Recently.”
Ryoka hesitated, and then bit her tongue nearly hard enough to break the skin. Belavierr turned her head.
“What?”
“Nothing. Uh…Wiskeria doesn’t want gold. Treasure? Power? She never asks for any of it? Not even once?”
The [Witch] stared at Ryoka. And then she shook her head slowly.
“When she was young, she asked it of me. Toys. Small things. I gave them to her. And then—she asked a favor of me. On behalf of a boy she knew. On the day she became a [Witch].”
“Will you tell me what happened? Since we have time?”
Belavierr nodded. She looked up, at the burning sky.
“It was a different time. We had fled the village where she grew up. My craft had enraged the villagers. Perhaps she hated me then? But she never said it. And I found a second home. One in a city. I believe she struggled then, because of me. But for her, I used my craft for gold. And I attracted attention. I cared not for it, but for her I worked my spells. And she made friends. One of them was a boy. I do not remember his name. But one day, my daughter came to me with a request.”
Ryoka waited. Belavierr’s eyes were lost. She spoke on, dispassionately. Her face unchanged as it glowed in distant fire’s light.
“She wanted me to grant his request. For he was a [Prince]. The prince of his nation. The Griffin Prince? That was it. The new one. And she called him a dear friend. So I agreed. And the boy told me he wanted to be proof against blades, that he might be the mightiest [Prince] his kingdom had ever seen. A worthy [King].”
She paused. Her face changed not one whit. Ryoka spoke.
“And? What did you do?”
Belavierr looked at her oddly.
“I did it, of course. I gave him his protection against blades. To do it, I cut him apart, piece by piece. And I wove him of my magic again. So long as my craft endures, he will be proof against blades. I did that for my daughter, but she fled me. And she cursed my name. That was the day she told me she hated me, Ryoka Griffin. That was the day…she became a [Witch]. And she left my side thereafter. Then, I did not understand why. I am trying to remember why it could be now.”
She paused, frowning. And Ryoka just stared at her and felt cold. Here sat a monster. Or if not a monster…someone else. Mortal, yes. But…she cleared her throat, coughed.
“Was he screaming when you cut him apart and…sewed him together?”
“Who?”
Another blank look. Ryoka paused.
“The Griffin Prince.”
Belavierr stared at Ryoka. And then she blinked and sighed.
“Oh. That was why she hated it.”
She shook her head. Ryoka was silent. Belavierr looked at her hands. Mystified. And then, tired.
