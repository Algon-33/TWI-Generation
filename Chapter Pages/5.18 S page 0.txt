“What’s it like, being a [General], Uncle Zel?”
“A general? Hm. That’s a difficult question. Why, are you planning on becoming a [General] instead of a Named Adventurer, Selys?”
“No…I don’t want to join the army. Grandma hates them. I do too. Every time they come home they cause trouble. They tried to kill some Antinium.”
“Ah. I heard about that incident. How is the city adapting to them?”
“Dunno. They’re weird, but I don’t see them often. There’s one in the City Watch. Did you know that?”
“I…did.”
“He’s really strange. He’s always polite and everyone avoids him. Why are we talking about the Antinium? What’s it like being a [General]? Huh? Tell me!”
“What part of being a [General] interests you, Selys?”
“Um…what’s it like being famous.”
“Famous?”
“You know. Everyone staring at you. Grandma said you led a huge army against a Gnoll Tribe last month!”
“The Vaskia Skyhunter Tribe. It wasn’t that large of an army. But yes. I had to do that.”
“So? What’s it like?”
“…What?”
“Being at the center of attention! Is it fun?”
“It’s not exactly like that, Selys. I’m a [General], not a hero. People take orders. It’s not like being an adventurer or a celebrity.”
“But they do pay attention to you, right?”
“They do.”
“I wish they did that to me. No one ever pays attention to me. Grandma’s famous. So are you. I’m just Selys.”
“It’s not everything you might think it is, Selys. Fame is a one-way street. Once you go down it, you can’t go back.”
“Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Er—being stared at by everyone isn’t always fun, Selys.”
“Why do you do it, then?”
“…Huh.”
“Wait, you don’t know?”
“I’m thinking. Hush for one second.”
“Okay.”
“…Why do I do it? Well, I don’t like being famous. Having everyone’s eyes on you, being trusted to lead an army…that’s a heavy responsibility. There’s something unique about being the one person in the world everyone’s watching. That’s true.”
“What’s it like, Uncle Zel?”
“Indescribable.”
“Really?”
“Really.”
“Does it feel good?”
“That’s hard to say too. Being in command, taking charge…some love the feeling of doing that. Others hate it. I do it because there’s no one else. Because it’s my duty. Because…it must be done.”
“Oh. Okay. Well, I bet that I’ll like it. When I’m a Named Adventurer I’ll visit you all the time, okay? I’ll be more famous than you are!”
“Hahaha—”
“Don’t laugh! I’m serious.”
“I’m sorry, Selys. I know you are. I was just thinking that might be pleasant. When you’re more famous than me, come visit me anytime. It would be refreshing to have a niece more famous than I am.”
“Just you wait. I’m going to do it. Grandma’s teaching me how to use a sword, and I can go into the sewers when I’m fifteen! Evvy’s parents are going to let her try when she’s fourteen, but Grandma says I’m too reckless. I’m not.”
“I’m sure she’s just being careful. And she is the Guildmistress of the Adventurer’s Guild, Selys.”
“Yeah. Anyways, I’ve been practicing with those claws you gave me! Look, I brought them!”
“Oh. Well done. I suppose if you’re here, I should teach you another trick. Unless you want to use a sword?”
“Nope! I’m gonna learn how to do everything. Teach me another trick!”
“Alright. Stand back and give me some room. You’re going to want to be a bit back from your opponent when you do this—”
“Wow! Let me try!”
“Careful. It’s not easy. And remember what I told you?”
“Don’t do this to anyone I know?”
“Right. But the second part—”
“‘Stay out of trouble.’ I know, Uncle.”
“I’m just concerned for my favorite niece.”
“Really? Your favorite?”
“Well, maybe my second favorite—”
“Uncle!”
