Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)

“Damn. Maybe this place has been plundered. And that’s a diving ship that hit the rocks.”
Inky cursed. Wil felt his heart sink. But the [Divers] were making ready. Two shipwrecks meant that there was twice as much to possibly find. They were preparing to go down, Inky among them.
“Can you dive, Lord Kallinad?”
“I swim fairly well.”
The [Lord] replied modestly; he was by far the best swimmer of the group. Inky grinned at him.
“And you, Sir Sea Cow?”
“I’m beginning to think you’re doing that on purpose, Miss Inky. I can hold my breath for six minutes.”
“Well, perhaps you’ll dive with me, you two. Once we make sure there’s nothing lurking in the wreck—”
Inky was teasing. And then—a voice from the crow’s nest.
“Captain? I see another shipwreck. No…two shipwrecks.”
Everyone stared up. Captain Lasc’s head slowly turned.
“Four shipwrecks?”
He looked at Wil. The [Lord] felt a prickle run down his spine.
“That wasn’t in the Professor’s notes at all, Captain Lasc.”
The [Storm Captain] looked at him. And then he turned his head.
“Delivan. Your [Dangersense]?”
“Not tickling. Yet. Captain.”
“But it could be…take us away, Delivan.”
“What? Why?”
Yerra looked incredulous. Captain Lasc stared narrow-eyed at the small outcropping of rock, and then into the underwater mountain.
“Something’s…off. We’ll investigate from afar. I’ll take volunteers. Away, Delivan. At least a few hundred feet and then—”
Something moved in the waters. Wil saw it. Everyone saw it. A shape crept around the side of the stone mountain. He froze.
“What is that?”
A gigantic shape breached the waters. A huge, armored leg pulled the creature upwards. Wil saw a huge eye, staring at him from a stalk. A chitinous body. Dark with algae and barnacles. And on its back—the hull of a ship.
A hermit crab. The size of The Emerald Signet, with a warship as its shell. Captain Lasc and the sailors stared as the crab’s head breached the waves.
“…That’s a big crab.”
Peki pointed calmly. Merrik swore.
“It’s got a ship on its back! Grandfather’s—”
“Take us back, Delivan! All hands! Prepare to maneuver!”
“It’s as large as we are! Are we going to fight?”
“Captain! Captain!”
Lasc was hesitating. The crab was huge, and The Emerald Signet was turning. Wil tried to push forwards as the [Divers] flung off their gear. They were grabbing for harpoons, ranged weapons. The crab was moving forwards, massive pincers raised. It clearly saw…food.
“We don’t need to tangle with that monster. We could try. My ship-spells are recharged. But I don’t like the odds of it.”
The [Storm Captain]’s magic came from his class and Skills. He aimed at the crab, appraising the fight. And then he saw Wil.
“Captain! Look!”
The [Lord] was white-faced. He was pointing. The [Captain] turned his head. And everyone saw.
There, on the part of the ship that was the crab’s shell. Something was glinting. The magical paint was worn. But—the name was still visible.
The Archmage’s Favor.
A ship’s name. Delivan’s eyes went round. Captain Lasc turned his head back. And he stared.
Archmage Zelkyr’s cargo. The [Storm Captain] thought.
“If we maneuver, we’ll keep out of range of that crab’s claws. And if the cargo is there? Watch for any magical attacks, Delivan. Steer us out of range! We’ll see how fast this crab is in the water!”
“Aye, Captain!”
The [First Mate] was turning the ship. The crab followed as The Emerald Signet shot away. The crew was cheering, aiming, waiting for the thing to get onto land. The crab was obliging them, climbing onto rock precipices after the ship.
