She wished it hurt more. But she had already known he died once. A second time?
“I’m not dead. They froze me.”
It was so strange. She hadn’t expected that. Who had come up with that idea? It had to be someone from Earth. Kevin? That felt right. That was a real Kevin-move. Erin smiled.
“I’m not dead!”
The [Witch] looked at her.
“Nor are you alive, according to Maviola El. And the bolts were poisoned. You cannot be healed. She feared the task of healing you was monumental.”
“Yeah. But…”
Erin’s voice trailed off. She sat there and thought.
Maviola El. Like Zel, she had come out of nowhere. She had burned Kasigna, going in to give Erin a chance to escape.
A glorious end. Still, Erin’s stomach suddenly fell. A terrible, terrible realization slowly engulfed her.
Why had Maviola been here? For this was the land of the dead. And that only meant…
“Califor. Maviola was alive when I…when I got shot. She was in the north. What happened? Did her time run out?”
Surely, that was it. Erin had known Maviola had a time limit of sorts. The [Witch] looked at her.
Califor the [Witch] could be kind. Could be gentle, and walk with a feather’s touch. But that was not Califor the Witch, one of the greatest of her era. She spoke and the words snapped even without air.
“She died in battle. Saving a love. And he went to war for you. Against a city called Hectval. I am told thousands died in the battle. The Necromancer interfered, but Olesm Swifttail and the army of Liscor, even the Antinium, threw themselves into a trap and suffered for it.”
Erin slowly recoiled. She stepped back and drifted for a moment. Weightless.
“No. That can’t be—”
What reason did Califor have to lie? The [Witch] regarded her.
“I wondered what sort of person would inspire the Tidebreaker of Izril and the matriarch of the House of El to sacrifice themselves to save. I see why. And I also see that you haven’t understood. You are not dead. Not yet. But you did die. And now, your friends, your family are trying to move the world to save you. Even if they die.”
“No. I don’t want that. They went to war? I—I—”
General Sserys shook his head, regarding Erin with disdain.
“Silly girl. Did you think you were not loved? Did you think they would do nothing? I have seen brave men and women of every species hurl themselves onto spear tips to save a lover, a friend. For a chance. Look at you. You haven’t even processed your death.”
He pointed. His claw accusatorially aimed at her chest. Erin looked down.
Six crossbow bolts stood out of her skin, blood oozing around the broken flesh. She stared at the colorful fletching and reached up to tug at them.
It hit her again.
“I…died? But I never saw it.”
She looked up at Sserys, pleadingly. He shook his head.
“You walked into an ambush. The [Lady] of fire told us all. A silly Human, running into crossbow bolts. Not even a protective ring. As if you were immortal.”
“I thought it wasn’t dangerous. I didn’t know—”
Her protests felt feeble. Califor looked at her.
“Few do. Who here knew how they would die? You, who died in battle?”
She turned. The [Lords] and [Ladies] of House Byres, the other guests of this place, Sserys, all shook their heads. Califor turned to Erin.
“I knew my death when the Spider, the Stitch Witch came to me and offered the dark deal. My daughter’s life, or mine. I never expected to die until the moment came upon me.”
“You had one chance. We all did.”
Sserys sat there.
