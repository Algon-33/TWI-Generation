Because—of course you knew the scrying orbs were showing this. Roses were red, violets were blue, and Drassi would take Octavia’s club and bash in Noass’s and Sir Relz’s heads if they didn’t show this.
They’d do it themselves if they missed it. This was television.
But what. Was. He. Up. To? The [Commentators] jabbering away, Rabbiteater’s friends and people and Lyonette—had no clue.
Perhaps it was his companions of the Order of Seasons, who knew Rabbiteater’s view on the class he had. Perhaps they had the first inkling.

The Goblin staggered upright. The figure-in-armor’s cloak swished as he raised one fist to the sky. The other held the shield at the ready. Then he whirled and dodged the eighth shot.
The Greatbows were firing, but now the [General] ordered them to synchronize their shots. Four at once. Enchanted munitions.
They nearly killed him. The [Knight] saw the bolts coming, saw the glowing tips, and dove. He came up in a roll, and the explosion as all four hit the ground nearly kicked him off his feet.
But he caught himself, and his head rose. This time—he lifted two arms.
Battered metal gleaming to the sky. The [Knight] looked like he was celebrating. The [General] wondered if he was taunting them. Did he know the Greatbows had, each, two hundred and thirteen shots left?
“[Instantaneous Reload]. Greatbows One and Two, fire, one second delay, then the other two.”
The [General] spoke crisply through his speaking stone. But he hesitated on giving the order to fire as something happened within his ranks. What the mysterious [Knight] of Izril had been waiting for.
A…riot?
Of all the things that the [General] was ready for, a mutiny in the ranks was not it. Yet that was what happened. The neat lines of warriors ready to charge devolved. He hesitated, saw arguing, fighting—
“[General] Rel, what is taking so long?”
Great General Dionamella was impatient. Somehow, in the midst of commanding, she had noticed them slow.
“Possibly confusion spells. Or airborne alchemy. I am seeing—fighting?”
At first, General Rel did not know what he was seeing. The front ranks were turning, and he wondered if it were an [Insanity] spell by the Archmage. But no—it wasn’t bloody. Yet even as he watched, a group of riders broke for him.
“Halt!”
His bodyguard raised their weapons, but the [Knights] dismounted.
“General! Please halt your advance!”
Three [Knights] all advanced past their comrades. All six hundred had suddenly turned. A representative of the Order of the Hydra, the Order of the Thirsting Veil, and the Order of Drell all strode to the [General].
“Explain.”
“It is a disgrace, sir! One [Knight] stands at the gates and takes on our Greatbows! He is challenging us.”
The Order of the Drell’s representative gave the most coherent answer. The [General] looked at the [Knight] and now saw the mysterious Ser Solstice gesticulating again.
He was slamming his bare hand against the shield as he waited for another volley. He hadn’t picked up the axe he had dropped; there was no point. The meaning was as obvious as could be.
Come on. Hit me!
Now the [General] saw what he was doing and gritted his teeth. The [Knights] were riding down on the confused Greatbow archers, blocking the way.
“General, we demand to fight this brave [Knight] alone! He is the same one who has defeated three [Generals]. Ser Solstice, the Goblin Slayer of Izril. I have heard his name from the Order of the Hydra. Sir, we petition you for the right to duel him as honor demands.”
“Absolutely not! This is a ruse to buy time!”
“Even so! Our class demands it!”
