Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)

“Very funny. It looks real. But this is just a prank. Right? On ‘Sea Cow’. Well done. It looks real. What did you do, smear a chest with muck and seaweed?”
“No. It’s real. I swear.”
“It can’t be. It’s not—”
The Minotaur reached for the lid. Only then did Wil come alive. Niers’ warning flashed into his brain.
“Venaz! Don’t! It’s cursed—”
Too late. The Minotaur had reached for the handle set into the lid. And he yanked as he turned to Wil, about to laugh. And then—
The lid exploded. Those on board covered their faces as sand exploded from the lid. Fountaining upwards, more sand than the box should have contained. Wil saw Venaz stumbling back.
A vast cloud of sand filled the sky. The mortal [Sailors] and students looked up. Captain Therrium stared up through the water. And the clouds began to coalesce.
Far away, a [King] sat up on his throne. And his eyes burned. He felt the power. He saw.
In the sky, a figure formed. Out of the sand, in the air he stood. Wil saw an undead face. Burning eyes. The [King] moved. And Wil was afraid.
But this was no mindless undead. No force in this world controlled him. The monarch, the ruler of Khelt spoke as he gazed down on the ship. His eyes alighted on Wil, identifying the [Lord].
“Ah. Someone has finally uncovered the resting place of my treasure. Interlopers. This is not yours. But you have recovered a relic of my kingdom. And the generosity of Khelt is unrivalled. Return to me my treasure and I will allow you a half of it for your mortality.”
He pointed down. And Wil, gaping up at Fetohep of Khelt, looked down. And there—in the ancient casket lay a collection of six swords. They shone like the sky, after thousands of years.
Fetohep of Khelt met Wil’s eyes.
“The Diamond Swords of Serept. Until your deaths I will grant you half. If you take my bargain. Refuse, and the curse of Khelt shall engulf you until nothing is left. Choose your fate.”
He waited. And the [Lord] of Kallinad…hesitated. He looked at the swords. He looked upwards, at the figure made of sand.
“The Diamond Swords of Serept?”
“Yes. Forged by Serept himself.”
“They’re really here? We found them?”
The huge apparition inclined his head.
“After my predecessor’s fleets did not, and they searched for hundreds of years. As I have said, my gratitude is vast. But they are mine. Choose, boy.”
He pointed at Wil and waited. The [Lord] paused. He glanced around.
“So—this isn’t a prank?”
Fetohep stared at Wil. He sighed.
“…No.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Notes: We are close to the longest chapter written. But here we be. Interlude – Strategists at Sea!
…Part 1. I got everything I wanted into the story. And did you enjoy it? Well, I’m dead. But I got what I wanted done and the thrilling (and hopefully a bit shorter) conclusion starts tomorrow!
Not much else to say. I’m off my break and this is what happens. Boredom, action, failed romance, sea cows, undead, and treasure. That’s an adventure.
The art for today is by…er…Microwaved Mrsha Plushie. I didn’t come up with the name, but they did a fantastic image of Reiss, our favorite [Necromancer]. Is that right? Well, I love the image. Thanks for reading!
…I write a lot. I also like [Pirates]. You may not have known that.
