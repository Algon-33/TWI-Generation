Her home street was gone. The shabby apartment? Torn down and replaced by a [Healer]’s clinic. Jasi stared. It had been months.
But it felt like years. She was conscious of looks at her—she was still wearing the dress from the Djinni’s Spoon. Someone came over.
“Milady? Spare a few coppers? We lost it all in the Bloodfeast attack. Me’n my sister are starving.”
A boy cupped his hands and looked pitifully up at her. His face was sooty, smudged, and his clothing torn. Jasi saw a pitiful girl clinging to his arm.
“Oh—”
The boy pressed forwards.
“Please, Miss. We haven’t ate for the last few days—”
His eyes flickered. Just in time, Jasi slapped the hand reaching for her coin pouch down. The boy sneaking up on her from behind yelped.
“Damnit! Run!”
He fled. The other two [Beggar]-[Thieves] turned to run.
“Hold it!”
Jasi snapped and the two froze. It was useful, being able to copy a Watch Captain’s snap. Jasi had imitated Zevara there. She beckoned them over.
“I won’t hurt you. But you two should know better than to run that con here.”
“What? You’re from the street?”
The boy’s jaw dropped. He hung back with the girl, who didn’t look so waifish anymore. They were clearly ready to book it if Jasi came after them.
Street urchins, like Grev. She put her claws on her hips.
“My brother did the same thing all the time. I’d have never thought someone would try it on me.”
They gave her goggle-eyed looks.
“And why not? You walk around with that much sparkle, here?”
Jasi had forgotten how she must look. And this street—it wasn’t rich, and it hadn’t been even before the attack. She had been so poor, washing clothes for coppers.
She shook her head.
“You two—are you actually starving?”
“It’s not fun. Most folk ran off after the attack. Fucking raiders.”
The boy spat. Jasi nodded. That was what she remembered too. She dug in her pouch.
“Here.”
She tossed a gold coin at both of them. The two yelped and grabbed for it. The boy bit the coin.
“Are you crazy?”
“No. I grew up here. And don’t you dare have a gang mug me or I’ll kill you. Go on.”
The boy and girl hesitated. Then the girl pointed, eyes wide.
“You—you’re Jasi! The Players of Celum!”
The Drake saw heads turn with the exclamation. Suddenly, the entire street was looking at her. She smiled, ruefully.
“That’s me.”
“You came back? I heard you’d left! Can I have an autograph? Hold on—maybe I can get one’ve the autograph blanks! Please?”
Jasi eyed the boy, who was desperately looking around.
“I just gave you a gold coin.”
“An autograph’s worth more! ‘Specially if you kiss it!”
“Miss Jasi! I saw your play!”
Someone sprinted up to Jasi. The Drake saw a man, fumbling for…
“I am a huge fan! I wanted to go to Invrisil, but I couldn’t find a ticket! Sign—sign my shirt! Please!”
He ripped his cloak off and bared his chest. Jasi backed up.
“I’m sorry, but I just came to—”
“It’s Jasi! She’s here! Are you going to perform? Please sign an autograph! Please! It’d mean food for a month!”
More people were flooding down the street. Like the boy, they had pieces of parchment, anything possible to sign.
And Jasi started to get worried. She’d had this in Invrisil, but Emme always had bodyguards or Eltistiman around. Here? The people had that desperate look. She backed up.
“I’m sorry. I have to go. I—”
[The Actor’s Shadow]? But that wasn’t a Skill to get away. Jasi began to turn. She might have to run but—
“Miss Jasi! Please! If you could just spare a minute, an hour! I’m such a fan—”
The man who wanted her to sign his shirt grabbed at her shoulder. He lunged—
