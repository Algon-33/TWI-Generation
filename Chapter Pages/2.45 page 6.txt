The thought of her is the shock I need. I blink and grit my teeth so hard my gums hurt. Teriarch stares at me in silence for a few moments. What should I say first?
“Well, I must congratulate you for punctuality, I suppose. You took longer than I had hoped, but you are clearly dedicated to your duties.”
I stare at him. What? What’s he—
Oh. Oh right. The letter. I’d barely remembered that.
Human Teriarch sighs. He waves a hand and a bag appears and gold coins appear out of the air and drop into it. A lot of coins for such a small bag*.
*A bag of holding? No—focus. Why do I feel so—so distracted? I was—was I depressed? Did that spell actually normalize my brain chemistry or something? Focus, Ryoka*.
**But I want to smile. I want to laugh. What the—I feel so good. What is this? I’ll take it, whatever it is. I can do this.
The old man waves the bag and it drifts towards me. He looks me in the eye, his heterochromic eyes hypnotizing.
“Speak the truth…messenger.”
Did he just forget my name? Teriarch clears his throat.
“I assume that you fulfilled my request and delivered both ring and letter to Perril Chandler?”
“I did.”
He nods.
“Was there any response? I doubt it, but the man might surprise me.”
“No. He…read the letter and said it was an appropriate gift.”
While he was making a horrific monstrosity over my head. Don’t mention that part! Just speak the truth. But half-truths. Yeah.
Teriarch looks vaguely pleased. He nods, but then flicks his fingers.
“Well, it took a bit of thought. And with that, I should be fine for another hundred…blast, what about Reinhart? Hmm…”
Unless Magnolia’s older than I thought, Teriarch believes in thinking ahead a lot more than a Human. And he’s pretty damn optimistic too, unless Humans live longer than they do in our world.
But then the old man pretending to be a mage looks back at me, and my spine stiffens. It’s not a spell; I’m just tense. I have to speak. I open my mouth, but then the bag flies towards me. I catch it instinctively.
“There. Eight hundred gold pieces, as agreed. I believe it should serve you well. Now, I will send you back to your city or hovel or wherever you please.”
He waves a hand and then hesitates.
“Ah. [Open Portal]?”
Did he just cast magic without using a spell? The shimmering magic of golden motes that begins to swirl around me started before he said those words. But that’s not important.
“Wait!”
He looks irritated.
“What is it this time? I will not renegotiate—”
Is now the time for it? No, no time to hesitate. I point at Teriarch, straight at his chest.
“You…you are a Dragon, aren’t you.”
He freezes. The air freezes. For a moment the world goes s—
 
“Ooh! She said it!”
“Shh! Quiet!”
 
That came from overhead. I barely process the voices, though. Neither, seemingly, does Teriarch. He stares at me. At last, he clears his throat.
“Dragon? What? You must be…I’m not a Dragon. Hah. You must be mistaken.”
Oh my—he sucks at acting! I stare at Teriarch. He stares back.
“Don’t lie to me. I know you’re a Dragon.”
“I’m not a Dragon. You’re mistaken. I’m uh, an [Archmage]. You must have confused my noble disposition with a Dragon’s…somehow.”
“I know you cast some kind of memory spell on me. I broke it and remembered. You. Are. A. Dragon.”
The white brows of the old man draw together.
“That’s impossible! No Human could—wait a second. Did Magnolia interfere? Is this one of her…pranks?”
“A Courier had a powerful charm. It broke the enchantment on me.”
