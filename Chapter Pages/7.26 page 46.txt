Author’s Notes: That was a lot of work. I am so tired. I didn’t land every single long, in-depth scene. I had to cut for time and it’s still a mega-chapter.
But here we are. Is it everything you dreamed of? Dragons don’t appear lightly. If they did, what would be the point? Erin might not have gotten a Skill, but you don’t every level. Or every two.
And here we are. I’ve known this chapter was coming for a while, but it was still hard. As I said, hope you enjoyed! I’m going to rest. Tuesday’s chapter may be…an easy one.
Don’t forget to vote in the polls! I’ll leave you with a bit of art. For today, I have an Adult Creler by tck_tck, a great artist on Instragram! Jason, another artist, asked for the drawing as part of a commissioned victory! I’m featuring Jason’s art, and the Creler! And Drassi, by fionclissmannart!
Give them all some love!
