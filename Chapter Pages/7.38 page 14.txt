“Oh, naturally. But there are, after all, different nations with different sensibilities. Selphids don’t care. And of course—you two do have your different perspectives.”
“Yeah…?”
Grimalkin had cast [Silence], so he said this next part smoothly.
“I couldn’t help but overhear a bit. Perhaps the issue of—Turnscales in society is not so contentious. Merely Drake culture. We must seem so…backwards to other people. Even, perhaps, left behind in time?”
Another wince. The Magus sighed. Erin was close to fainting. Or running away. Or hyperventilating. She looked around. She had to—
“Aha! Kevin! My guy! Switch with me, would you? Sorry, Grimalkin! I’ve gotta get back to work!”
Erin used Kevin, shoving him into the seat. It was super-effective! At least, in slowing Grimalkin down. But she’d just exposed her weak points.
The [Sinew Magus] looked at Kevin and he tried the same trick.
“Don’t you feel as though you’re…lost in time sometimes?”
Erin froze mid-step. Kevin blinked at Grimalkin. He was unguarded. Erin had to warn them all! She spun—and Kevin nodded.
“All the time, man. I mean…what is time? Time. Is it a river or a whirlpool or is it…”
He trailed off. Grimalkin stared at him. Kevin’s unfocused gaze came back to reality.
“Time? You know, if it goes backwards, does it go up or down? Those are the real questions.”
“Er. Yes. [Chronomancers] do exist and they’ve postulated—I mean, what?”
“Sometimes I wonder—you know, the word? Some times. That’s an interesting word when you think about it. Some of the times. Which is what it means. But what about…alltimes? But that’s not one word, right? But it should be.”
The [Sinew Magus]’ mouth opened and closed as he ran straight into the most logical wall of illogic he’d ever heard. He peered at Kevin, and then he and Erin both smelled the distinct scent in the air.
“Dreamleaf.”
The Drake sighed, disgusted. Erin fled, resolving to thank Palt rather than scold him. His quarry escaped. Grimalkin folded his arms.
“Even so. That was no anomaly. I’m sure of it. But what do I do with the knowledge?”
“That’s the question, dude. What do you do with knowledge?”
“Oh, shut up.”

In the end, it had all been a failure. A big waste of time. But why—why did it matter? Money could just sit around, right? Did it lose value if you didn’t touch it? Surely not.
It was all about Selys, after all. And she told Erin what the real problem was.
“I’m just worried about the future, you know?”
Erin gave her friend a suspicious look, then glanced towards Grimalkin’s table, but he’d already left.
“Yeah. I mean, no. What are you worried about?”
“Um. Whether I’ll die in the future, whether I can defend myself or Mrsha—what I want to do with my life, how to invest my money in case it runs out, safeguarding my stuff…”
Selys ticked off the points on her claws. Erin clutched at her stomach.
“Ooh. Now I get it. That makes me feel bad just thinking about the future. Or maybe it was the clams. Did I boil them long enough?”
The [Heiress] laughed.
“Erin, you’re the worst at committing to things. At least I try. But that’s why you have Lyonette. I just wish…”
“Hey! I plan for things! I had all kinds of stuff I…introduced.”
Erin looked around for Grimalkin again and leaned over sneakily to Selys.
“Remember the hamburgers? Or pizza? Or stuff?”
“You just copied that, Erin. That’s short-term stuff. It matters, I’m talking about the future.”
“Hey!”
Erin raised a finger and had to concede—Selys was right. The [Innkeeper] leaned on the table with a sigh.
