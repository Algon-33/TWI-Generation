The [Ice Mage] froze.
“Who? Nokha?”
Again, the Minotaur didn’t respond directly to the question. He looked straight through Ceria.
“I can hear her. You shouldn’t have taken me out. She knows. She’s waiting for you to let her out.”
“Who? Who’s ‘she’? Did she do this to you? Where is she?”
Slowly, Ceria approached the walls of the cell. She stared at Calruz. The Minotaur stared blankly at her for a minute, then two. And then something changed. He blinked.
“Ceria?”
This time he looked at her. And recoiled. He was surprised to see her. Ceria backed up, clearly uneasy.
“Calruz? What were you talking about? Who’s ‘she’?”
“Who?”
The Minotaur stared blankly at her. Ceria looked around. Calruz shook his head.
“Sometimes I feel like…what did I say? What have I done?”
“I—”
The half-Elf had been prepared for something. Not for this. She took another step backwards, looking down the prison. Calruz stepped forwards. He placed a hand on the magical barrier.
“I remember it. All of it. What I did. I went mad. Springwalker, you have to believe me.”
Ceria caught herself. She glared back at Calruz, biting her lip, clenching a fist.
“I believe you’re mad. You—you turned into a monster.”
“I know. I must be punished. But part of it—I didn’t intend for it. I started losing myself. You have to believe me.”
The Minotaur spoke urgently. His hands trembled on the walls of his cell. Ceria eyed him.
“I do. I do, Calruz.”
“Please tell them that. Please. I never intended this. Tell them. Make them know.”
“They’ll never forgive you, Calruz. I don’t think I can—”
“I don’t want that. Death is my only salvation. I’ll settle my debts that way.”
The Minotaur never blinked. Ceria froze.
“Don’t say that.”
“It’s nothing less than I deserve. You and I both know that. Tell them I’ll accept whatever punishment. The Gnolls—they deserve justice. Whatever it takes. Tell them. Please.”
“Oh, Calruz—”
Ceria went over to the cell. She bowed her head and put her hand against the magical barrier of the cell. Calruz stared at her.
“I’ve lost my honor.”
“Calruz—”
Her voice broke. Ceria leaned against the wall of the cell, her shoulders shaking. It was then that Pisces decided to stop listening. He straightened and turned his head. The undead mouse collapsed.
“Well?”
Yvlon stared at him. She and Ksmvr were waiting outside the dungeon. Pisces blinked.
“Well, what?”
“Don’t pretend. What are they saying?”
“I stopped listening.”
Yvlon jabbed Pisces in the side. He yelped.
“I did!”
The armored woman eyed him, but eventually nodded.
“What do you think she’s going to do?”
“Beyond saying goodbye? I have no idea. She may wish to…stay for the trial.”
“I can’t blame her, can you?”
“Captain Ceria is blameless in the guilt of former-Captain Calruz, surely.”
Ksmvr looked anxiously between Pisces and Yvlon. The [Necromancer] nodded.
“Oh, undoubtedly. Yvlon is merely referring to Ceria’s perceived guilt. If she wishes to stay, well, I am sure we can find work here.”
“And after the trial?”
Pisces shrugged. He stared towards the walls of Liscor.
“I imagine we find work.”
“Just like that?”
“It is our function.”
Ksmvr put in unhelpfully. Pisces just shook his head.
“What would you have me say, Byres? Some grand proclamation about our future? We obtained…success in the dungeon. Ceria, perhaps, closure. But this siege, the Goblins…it has made one thing abundantly clear to me. And one thing alone.”
“Go on?”
“Stronger. We must be stronger, all of us.”
