Perhaps it’s just as well the gods are dead. Because as I hold a dying child in my arms, I can’t believe in anything greater. Not God, not heaven—
Certainly not myself.
I’ve always been a failure. It eats at me in the dark times and my happy moments. Before, I had medicine to stop the thoughts clawing at me, dragging me down. But now I see I was always right. The happy times were an illusion.
I can do nothing. I am nothing. I can’t be a hero, I can’t fight. I can’t even save a single kid.
Wilen gasps as he clings to me. He’s still alive. But not for long. I can see it. His spine and lower torso are—
“It hurts. A bit.”
He’s biting down so hard his teeth have gone through his lips. I hold him to my chest. I don’t know what to say.
“You’re going to be okay.”
He gives me the same look as whenever I make a truly terrible joke. It almost makes me want to laugh.
“I’m going to die. But you should run. He’s coming.”
I can hear the Troll thumping towards me down the street. The gargantuan bastard is taking his time, strolling along. I don’t move. I can’t.
“I’m not leaving you here.”
“You’ve got to. I am dying.”
He says it so matter-of-fact, but his small hand is squeezing my arm. I know he’s right. He does too. I don’t know what to do. He holds something out to me. A sword? No—just a knife. A kitchen knife. He must have tried to defend himself.
It falls from his fingers. He can’t even hold it. Wilen is in pain. He’s—I can see the hurt in his eyes.
So I tell a joke.
“Hey. I’ve got a joke for you.”
I say it out of desperation, out of fear. Because he hurts and I want to take away the pain.
Wilen looks at me. He tries to smile and fails. Sweat and tears roll down his face, indistinguishable.
“Is it a good one?”
“You tell me.”
“Okay.”
I take a deep breath. I don’t have a joke. But it comes to me in a flash.
“Wh-what do you call a fat [Clown] sitting in front of a Troll?”
Wilen gasps. His face goes a little paler, and he grips my arm as strongly as he can. His grasp is weakening. I look down, and see the blood pooling under the skin.
“What? What’s a…fat [Clown] sitting in front of a Troll?”
“The main course.”
It’s not funny. But he giggles, and blood trickles out of his stomach.
“That’s good. But I don’t want—”
He loses focus for a second and stops speaking. I hold him in my arms for a while, waiting for him to finish the sentence. Then I realize he’s dead.
Behind me the earth shakes and I hear a heavy laugh from overhead. I smell a terrible, putrid stench, and the smell of blood and death.
But I don’t care.
My head is swimming, but my eyes are dry. All my tears run from my heart. Like blood, dripping onto the ground. My blood.
Everything is spinning. I can feel death approaching, snuffling and grunting. The Troll.
I close Wilen’s eyes and move. I stand up. I keep moving. And I smile.
I am not happy. I don’t think I’ll ever be happy again. But this is tragedy, and I can either fold up and die, or move on.
Because that’s what a clown does. I think I get it. We make comedy out of tragedy, and pretend everything’s funny when it’s not. We…
Tell jokes so no one can see the tears inside.
The Troll is behind me. I see his massive shadow as he raises his club. Laughing. But he doesn’t get it. He doesn’t understand true humor. He doesn’t understand anything.
I close my eyes. Sometimes you just need to let go. And let the funny inside you out.
Ha. It was a pretty funny joke.
Hahahaha.
