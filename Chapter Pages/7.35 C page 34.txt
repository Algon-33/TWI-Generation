The Giant’s voice was kindly. Flora nearly wept herself. She shouted up at him and her voice bounced upwards, echoing, echoing…
“Aren’t you afraid? Of anything? Don’t you feel sad? Your children die. Your people die! Aren’t you angry? Don’t you fear dying?”
The Giants stirred. They looked down at her. And then Callidaz’s body shook. The female Giant to his left shook.
The world trembled. Flora fell to her knees. First she feared it was their wrath. Then she realized.
They were laughing.
They laughed and the mountains shook with their laughter. In the distance—the Blighted Kingdom wondered what moved the earth.
“If we feared death, we would not be here.”
Callidaz told her once the rumbles ceased. He shook his head a final time and sat back. Greenery moved around him. Earth. He sat there, still as stone.
“Anger. Hatred. Sadness. Fear. Of course we feel such things. Smallfolk wonder. But we are alike, you and I.”
The Giant’s lips moved.
“Yes. We wonder. Yes. We question. Yes. We grieve. Our little half-children die. Of course we mourn. But we also listen. They say our children wage war well. They say we are better used here than elsewhere. So we wait.”
“And if you have to fight? And you all might…die?”
“We took a side.”
Another Giant’s voice. Flora waited. But that was all.
They took a side. Slow to rage. Almost ponderous to decide, to act. But mighty. The last of the tall. When the Giants made war—even Dragons feared their wrath.
Callidaz finished their conversation. He looked down at Flora, as she held the gun. He could have snuffed her out like a candle. Without even trying. By accident. Perhaps that was why he sat so still.
“Flora of Humans. You ask if this is right. I do not know. You must choose. We are only Giants. We do not know wisdom. We trust our friends. We listen. We decide. That is how we live. Nothing more. We chose a side.”
The giants nodded. The mountains rumbled. Callidaz looked down at her.
“Someday it may not be our side. That is how these things go. But we saw. We decided. Now—we wait. In time, we will fight and die or live. We wait.”
The sun set at their backs. The darkness filled the skies. And the Giants smiled.
“Flora of Humans.”
“Yes, Callidaz?”
“You worry so over what you bring. Weapons. New things. But that is what your kind always does. You make new weapons. Well done. You change. Well done. Keep changing. It is what Humans are good at. That is why we fade. So take pride.”
He sat back and sighed. The Giant whispered, as the others sat back with him. Slowing. Waiting. Callidaz said one last thing.
“Take heart, Flora of Humanity. Of Earth. When you came here, you brought a weapon that could change the world. But when you came, you already changed the world. By saving a life.”
“I…didn’t do much. It was luck, me being able to help…it wasn’t much…”
The earth rumbled. Callidaz stared ahead.
“No. You did. Rejoice.”
He closed his eyes. And Flora turned and began to walk away. For better or worse. It was a funny thing. She did not feel better, but she knew he was right. It had already happened.
“You changed the world.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I think that’s a good way to end it. There are a lot of words I could write that give away everything. Or nothing. It’s not something I’m going to write now, though.
A shorter chapter! I had a very rough time with…life…interrupting me. But despite it being short, I think that you might uh, find it consequential.
