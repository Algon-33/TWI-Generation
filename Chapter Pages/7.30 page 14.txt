“I’m glad to have you. I mean—I’m very grateful for your help. And the rest. I think this has been great. The best time in my life.”
The Drake interjected quickly. Maviola smiled. Her eyes flicked to his face and she shook her head. Her black-and-orange hair moved in the dawn’s light.
“Olesm. I told you. I love you, as much as I’ve loved anyone. But it won’t last. I have to leave soon.”
“Don’t say that.”
The Drake reached out. Maviola hesitated, but she let him grasp her hand. The Drake held on tight.
“You’re—the best thing that’s happened to me all year. In the last decade. Don’t say you have to go.”
“The truth is the truth.”
Her voice was calm. And when she looked at him again—he felt like a child speaking to an adult. And he hadn’t felt like that way in years. But Maviola was old. Her eyes flickered like fire. But old fire, raging one last time before the darkness closed in. Gently, she put her other hand on his, clasping his claw.
“Olesm. I mean to give you fire. Me meeting you was fate. I want to believe I was sent here to help you learn to…burn. You were a faded ember when I found you. All I did was light your fire.”
“You did that. First the Council and the newspaper—it’s a huge success! Drassi actually got scouted to work for Pallass! And the money coming in from the newspaper is big. Why then—do you have to go?”
Her eyes were sad.
“Sometimes that is just the way it is. I wish I had met you long ago. I wish I hadn’t waited. I wish…”
She trailed off. Olesm tightened his grip and Maviola looked at him. The Drake took a shuddering breath. He hadn’t planned on it today. But she sounded like—
“Listen. It doesn’t have to be that way. I don’t care how sick you are. I’m—I’m resourceful. I know that doesn’t sound like much, but Erin’s my friend. If we need to get you to the Healer of Tenbault or—Saliss of Lights visits Erin’s inn. However ill you are, we can fight it.”
Maviola’s eyes widened. Then she put her head back and laughed. Olesm paused. He had been so sure he was right. But Maviola just laughed until she cried, and wiped the tears from her eyes.
“You’re too beautiful, Olesm Swifttail.”
That was all she said. And she kissed him on the cheek. Then Maviola shook her head and stood.
“I won’t go today. Or tomorrow. But soon. Let’s just make the most of today, alright?”
“Okay. But please don’t go.”
The Drake stood up, feeling helpless. He saw the young woman turn her head to the open window. And for a moment, she hesitated. Then fire laughed and embraced him.
“I have so much to do. So much I want to do, now. I’ll try. But I make no promises.”
She whispered. Then the young [Lady] took Olesm’s arm and spun him around. Her laughter filled the apartment.
“Come on. You have so much left to learn! Combat—[Mages]—let’s study for a few hours. Then you have to go to work.”
“And you? Are you going to work with Hexel…?”
Olesm looked at Maviola, whom he had hired to help him with his duties. She had been helping manage the [Architect] Lamia, but Maviola shook her head.
“Your Councilman—Elirr?—is far better at it than I. He and Hexel get along better, always.”
“Really?”
“Believe me. I know how people work. I can see it. Today, I think it’s time I met Erin Solstice. I have something to teach her as well.”
The [Strategist] caught his breath.
“What’s that? I mean—Erin? Why her?”
Maviola winked.
“She has a lot of potential. Just like you. I see that too.”
And she looked at him like he was the sun. The Drake held onto Maviola. He didn’t want to let her go.

It started with an upset [Lady]. And weak tea.
