The Watch Sergeant gasped. The crowd fled around the Watch, screaming, a few people falling, being trampled. Relc saw the [Soldiers] coming on.
Not in a mass like the crowd. In formation. That was the scary thing. They were out for blood, but they fought like a unit. Unless they were greatly outnumbered, they’d crush a mob, [Anarchists] or not.
“Watch Sergeant! They’re going to run the civilians down!”
One of the Senior Guards barked in horror. He saw a [Soldier] kicking at a fallen figure as they marched after the crowd. Relc guessed someone had killed one of the [Soldiers], and they were out for blood.
The army sticks together. The Watch Sergeant tore herself out of her stupor. Hatred for her or not, she was still a Watch Sergeant. She took a breath and bellowed into the stone that magnified her voice.
“This is the Watch! Hold your ground! We have this street under control!”
The [Soldiers] didn’t stop. They had some kind of [Captain] or [Lieutenant], Relc saw. The [Captain] was bloody-faced. Idiot didn’t have a helmet. The officer pointed and a wall of armed Drakes came at the Watch.
The Watch backed up. If there was a hierarchy of violence, they were also below the army. And the [Soldiers] saw the crowd pressed around the Watch. They saw the opportunity to trap the same people who’d been deviling them for the last four days. Take vengeance.
“Back up! Let the civilians run! Back up—”
The Watch tried to move to let the others escape, but they were hemmed in by the press of terrified people. Relc saw everyone shoving, and the [Soldiers] were pounding forwards, roaring…
“Watch Sergeant. I can stop them. Give me permission.”
A hand grabbed the Sergeant as she shouted, pushing frantically. She turned.
Senior Guardsman Relc stared at her, amid the blood and terrified faces, people pleading, screaming. His face was covered in grime, and the helmet, but his bright yellow eyes locked on hers. She held his gaze in that infinite time when everything seemed slow and fast.
Not an immortal moment. But…then the Watch Sergeant nodded.
“Go. Clear ranks!”
The Watch moved back as a [Guard] strode through the civilians, pushing through them like a rock through the current. The [Soldiers] saw a solo figure break through the wall of bodies with their backs to them.
They didn’t slow. Why would they? The Drake was big, but he was one Drake. And they were an army.
They did slow when they heard the voice. It was a bark. Not a roar. A loud voice. It had more than just volume to it; it was the voice in your earhole, that you didn’t ignore.
[Sergeant’s Command].
“Company, halt! Move your tails and I will pluck them off and shove them so far up your behinds you can chew on them!”
The [Soldiers] skidded to an uncertain stop. The voice was unfamiliar. The threat? Even the other [Sergeants] winced and stopped.
The [Captain], blood running down his face, stared at the Senior Guardsman. He looked at his company.
“What are you waiting for? Advance! I said, advance! Get those b—those criminals!”
The [Soldiers] stepped forwards uncertainly. The spear-Drake planted his spear on the ground.
“Take one more step and I will arrest you and you will be eating soup out of your boots for the rest of your lives! This is not a war!”
“I said, forwards!”
The [Captain] was losing the shouting match. But he was the [Captain]. The [Soldiers] hesitated.
Then Relc lowered his spear. He took a posture they all recognized. The [Spearman]’s guard. As if he were in formation.
“Come any closer and I will run you through.”
