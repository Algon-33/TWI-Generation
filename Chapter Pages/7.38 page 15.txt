“Maybe you’re right, Selys. I’m bad about that. I just don’t like…that kind of big stuff. I did have things I wanted to do.”
“Really? You?”
“Mhm. I was going to buy a Golem. You know, so Toren could get a friend?”
The Drake paused with a forkful of spaghetti-and-clams that Lasica had helped Erin make before taking half the clams as payment to her mouth. She gave Erin a look.
“Really? You were going to buy a Golem?”
“Mhm. Before I got kidnapped to Celum, and even after that, I was looking into prices. But Stone Golems are expensive. Like, even the cheapest ones that needed repair were over a thousand gold pieces.”
“Um. Yeah. Golems aren’t cheap.”
“I know! But I wanted one! Just imagine how useful it would have been! I had other plans too. Like…getting the inn enchanted. But look where we are. Lyonette is the one who really got Hedault to do that.”
Erin waved a hand towards the kitchen. She peered at the doorway to the garden, where Mrsha, Ekirra, and Visma were playing ‘Gnollball’ with Numbtongue, which was really him just throwing them as hard as he could from the hill into the pond.
“Some things I didn’t even imagine. Like Numbtongue. Or…I wish I had done some of the things before.”
Her eyes glimmered. Selys remembered five Hobgoblins sitting around a table as if it were yesterday and forever ago. So did Erin.
“What else?”
She was genuinely curious, but not if it hurt Erin. The [Innkeeper] hesitated. Then she smiled, ruefully.
“You know, I barely remember. Hold on, I can check! I think…”
The young woman charged into the garden, and the door vanished. Selys heard a loud thump, and cursing from upstairs. Then Erin hopped through the doorway, barely seconds later.
“Ouch. I ran into my dresser! But—data! Here it is!”
She showed Selys a little journal she took notes in. It wasn’t really a diary so much as interesting chess notations, thoughts, grocery lists, and…a page of little items, with annotations.
“What’s this?”
“My list of future-stuff. Big ideas I had. See?”
There was ‘Golems’ written on one line. With little annotations.
 
Golems—stone? Metal? Super expensive! Build yourself? Get Pisces to make?
 
It was also crossed out and ‘bad idea’ had been written there. Probably after Toren. That was one entry. Selys grinned.
“Maybe he can do that. Not all of these ideas are bad, Erin.”
“Yeah. I know, right? Let’s see what else I wrote.”
The two bent over the notes for the future as Kevin tried one of Palt’s cleansing cigars and rapidly sobered.
“Whoa. Dude. But why wouldn’t you want to be high?”
“Time and a place, Kevin. Don’t you have to practice football?”
The Centaur plucked the cigar out of Kevin’s hands. The young man groaned.
“Oh, thanks! You saved me! You know, Dreamleaf isn’t quite like weed…”
The two heard laughter. Selys and Erin were exclaiming over the paper.
“Erin! A ballista? What are you, Bird?”
“What? I wanted to put one on top of the inn! He has some good ideas! And look at this one—put the inn on wheels!”
“Do you even know how heavy an inn is?”
“Duh. That’s why it’s off the list. Ooh! Look at this one! Ping pong tables! Well, not all of these are huge. But this one is.”
Erin tapped one of her notes proudly. Selys read, frowning.
“Boom bark walls? You don’t mean…”
“I had the idea from the second inn. I was going to ask Moore if he could regrow the wall’s bark. You know, since he’s a nature mage? So if there was a siege—”
Erin made her arms go ‘boom’. Selys, Palt, and Kevin all stared at Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked around.
