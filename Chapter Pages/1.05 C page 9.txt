“You’re an idiot, Fool. The Demons, the Blighted King—they’re just sides. There’s no right or wrong! I didn’t choose to help these idiots because I thought they were right. I just thought both sides deserved a funny man helping them. It makes things more entertaining that way.”
He doesn’t respond. I drag on. Okay, now I’m up another flight of stairs. I go up, listening to the Fools’ face smack on every step.
He’s barely conscious by the time I get to the top. He mumbles and I have to lean down to listen.
“It could have ended all today. It could have. Why did you have to speak? Why…?”
I blink at him. Shrug.
“Because, Fool, it’s in my nature. It’s in yours as well. Why do you think people stare at us? We, the two sad idiots who dance around for them. It’s because this war is like a performance, Fool.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Of course you don’t. So I’ll make it simple for you, Fool. Here’s why.”
I pat him on the head and lean down. I whisper in his ear.
“I want to see what comes next.”
He looks up at me.
“That’s all?”
“Pretty much.”
“Damn you.”
“So they say. But here I am. And here…we are.”
I drag him the rest of the way down the corridor. There’s a man waiting for us there. Nereshal’s got some cuts down one arm, but he looks pretty good considering he took an alternate route here.
“Hey.”
I wave at him. Nereshal stares at me.
“Are you ready?”
“Sort of. Hold on—can I go to the bathroom first? No? Fine, I’ll just go off the edge.”
Nereshal drags the Fool upright. I push him towards the end of the corridor, and then out. Out, through a door, and into the battlements of a tower. High up. I stare down at the courtyard below. At the Demons standing down there, fighting with people at the gates, protecting the [Mage].
They haven’t spotted me. Oh wait. No, they have. One of them, the [Archer] with the big frickin’ bow, is pointing. The Demons look up. I wave.
“Demons!”
Nereshal’s voice thunders down at them. He stands back, away from the battlements, hands raised as he concentrates on a spell. I edge over, using the Fool as a shield. My voice, made incredibly large by magic, echoes down at them.
“Hi! How are you all doing tonight? Good? May you drink from the blood of a thousand Human skulls and all that. Hey, what’s with all the soldiers these days? It’s like you can’t even assassinate a Blighted King without tripping over them.”
They stare up at me. I grumble.
“No one likes observational humor. Okay, see this guy? This is your friend. The Fool. Wait, what’s your real name?”
I stare at him. The Fool holds still. He’s staring down at the [Mage] specializing in teleportation magic, far below. Now I finally get a good look at her and…
“That’s a lot of tentacles.”
“That’s her hair.”
“What’s with her arms?”
“She was hurt in war.”
“She’s looking right at us. Hey you. Mage lady! Hi! Do you know this guy?”
I point to the Fool, balancing him on the edge of the battlements. The [Mage] does seem to know him. She’s staring up at him. And what a stare. I look at the Fool. He’s doing the same kind of stare back at her. Another piece of the puzzles snaps into place.
“Hey, wait a second…you like her! And she likes you! You said you were talking to your true love back in the courtyard—fancy that!”
I slap my hand to my forehead and nearly drop the Fool. Nereshal hisses at me and I grab him just in time before he goes over the edge and falls a few hundred feet below.
“Whoops. Sorry. Now, that makes me feel awful about what’s going to happen next.”
“Kill me. She won’t betray her mission for me.”
The Fool looks calmly at me. I shake my head.
