Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

The bodyguards. Soot’s bodyguards were mangled. Had they been eating them? Even in the tribes, that was madness. Bearclaw looked around, licking her lips. Then her eyes, adjusting to the darkness saw something else.
The Gnoll’s chests were torn open. Their hearts were missing. Nokha coughed again. Expectorating. But she smiled.
“I was sick. Now, I am better. But it took too many…prey.”
“I—my gang is coming.”
Bearclaw’s words were desperate. But the insane—beast—ignored her. She hadn’t been keen on listening to Bearclaw anyways. The Gnoll woman backed up towards the door. But two Raskghar were there. They looked down at her. Bearclaw was huge. She wasn’t used to being smaller, but they were all bigger than she was.
Prey.
Nokha muttered as the two grabbed Bearclaw. The fight was short. They held her down as she screamed. The Raskghar moved forwards.
“You are strong. Good. Strength is better.”
Her voice made it clear as to what the purpose was. Bearclaw was pleading now, trying to break free. But it was too late. Nokha looked around.
“Her heart makes two. I want a pack-sister. Then we do things.”
The other Raskghar grumbled. They wanted more hearts. They were all…sick. Nokha had eaten every heart. Only she was Awakened. But the female Raskghar lashed out, striking one of the dissenters.
“No more hearts. These only! The city is too watchful. Too many noses! Obey.”
She snarled. The others backed away as the Gnoll flexed her limbs. She felt better. Months of being sick had made her weak. But this? Soot had had five Gnoll bodyguards. Five rituals. Nokha smiled.
“Two true Raskghar are enough. We cannot fight them.”
She spoke half to Bearclaw. The criminal was begging for her life. But the Raskghar didn’t care. She smiled down at Bearclaw and patted her head. Like she would a Gnoll cub. A child of a species only related to hers. She spoke, clearly.
“We are all sick. You understand? You made us like this. Surface-people. Light-walkers. Too smart. You are so smart. I, Nokha, understand this.”
She tapped her head.
“We must learn from you. You have so much to give us.”
She heard a whimper. Nokha looked around. She pointed at her favorite Raskghar. The female Raskghar smiled and bared her teeth. Nokha nodded at the others. They could still feast. They were so hungry. Those few of them who had managed to enter the sewers were the strongest of the Raskghar—the others were in hiding. Sick.
But not for long.
As the others gathered around Bearclaw, Nokha went back to investigating Soot’s corpse. So interesting. She called out, once, amid the screams.
“Save her skin. I want to wear it.”
Then—she had another thought. The Raskghar looked up and her mouth opened in a big smile.
“And save her skull. I want to know how she thinks.”
She had so much to learn. About herself. And—Gnolls. Awakening was only the start. Nokha felt the power. And smiled.
By the time the Watch found the safe-house, only Mr. Soot was left.

Mr. Soot…was dead. His plans had been foiled. Bearclaw was on the run. She had probably left the city. All in all, it was a victory. Because no one had died. That was how it worked, right?
If you counted like that, sure. It took nothing else into account. Nothing…
Like the Drake, sitting in his apartment in the darkness. Relc Grasstongue was alive. Healed, in fact.
Healing potions worked like that. Once you got rid of the poison, you were…healed. The [Healer] had been touch-and-go, but she had saved his life.
