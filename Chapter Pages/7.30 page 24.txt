Erin sat. Maviola sighed. They regarded each other a second time. Erin was shaken. Shook. But she was thinking.
“You’re a [Lady].”
“I am.”
“You have—[Like Fire, Memory]. Don’t you?”
“I was the first.”
Maviola’s eyes glittered with amusement as Erin’s jaw dropped.
“No way. But then—when you threw alcohol on me—and why didn’t you say anything?”
“It wasn’t a good time. I was impressed, to be honest. You’ve learned to call at least two different fires, haven’t you?”
“Four. Well—well, I can do three. The last one is hardest. It’s purple…”
Maviola laughed in delight and clapped her hands together.
“Purple? You mean—love?”
Erin jumped and blushed.
“Love? No, it’s happiness!”
“What? Love is purple.”
“No it’s not. I’ve never had love fire. I have glory-fire, which is pink—”
“That’s gold for me.”
The two stared at each other. Lady Firestarter blinked, and then she started giggling.
“So it’s different colors! Of course! I’ve always seen glory as gold. But you must see it as—pink! Pink!”
“Hey! Pink is a good color!”
Erin defended herself. Maviola was nodding and laughing.
“Of course! And hatred is invisible—how brilliant! I have no invisible fire. Hatred is black for me. I wonder if I could change the color? I’ve never tried.”
“But you have the Skill? Who—who are you? I heard you and Olesm were dating…”
“We’re not dating.”
Maviola’s laughter turned into an amused look. Erin blinked.
“But Drassi said—”
“We’re not—‘boyfriend’ and ‘girlfriend’. We’ve been intimate. But I don’t have much time left.”
The young woman—no—Maviola’s amused look made the two terms seem juvenile. Erin’s eyes popped.
“You and Olesm? But—wh—”
The woman shook her head.
“That’s something else. Let’s talk more about the fire.”
“No it’s not. Go back. Explain. Why—”
“Erin. Look at me.”
The [Lady] spread her arms. And Erin saw her eyes shimmer. Fire raced up her arm. But this time—it wasn’t one color.
Her hand burned with white flame. But further up, green fire, calm and cool, the fire of contentment, burned. Then red, passion, rage.
Black hatred. Maviola El stared down at the Goblin King as the Flowers of Izril began to sortie. She pointed, and the [Archers] launched a fiery volley that exploded among the ranks of the Goblins. But there were too many—
Sorrowful blue. Fulviolo El was dead. His son lay sick in bed, just a boy, as Maviola received the news. She stood there, as everyone turned to her. But she could not believe. Her brother was dead. Dead—he was—
Gold glory. She rode through a forest fire, her army marching through the fire that burned only their enemies. The Drakes were in retreat; even their Oldbloods fled this fire. Lady Firestarter charged—
Purple, deep love. Erin saw Maviola kissing Olesm—a woman dancing with a laughing man—
Like a rainbow of color, the flames raced up Maviola’s arm. But more colors than even a rainbow held. Each one was beautiful. Deep. Erin felt tears springing to her eyes. She stared at Maviola. And she saw a young woman. But in the memory, she saw Maviola aging. Her memories of her body betraying her. Yet the fire remained. And now—
The two sat there. Erin blinked. And then she looked at the [Lady] sitting across from her. And her objections faded. She saw an old woman smiling gently. Her face lined, bound by a chair. Her form withered. For a moment. But she had always been the young woman who lounged in the chair. Even as time changed her.
“Oh. So that’s who you are.”
That was all the [Innkeeper] said. Maviola almost—flinched. In a moment, Erin had seen more than perhaps even the [Lady] intended. She shook her head.
