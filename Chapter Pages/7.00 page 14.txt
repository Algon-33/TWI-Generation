“You’ll see! It is right in the new section of the city. There are apartments that have been made for all the new workers. The city, it is full to bursting, yes? But there is already a temporary wall. Twenty feet high! The Antinium made it, and the apartments. Quickly, too.”
She glared at Hesna. The Drake rolled her eyes.
“The Antinium? You mean, the bug-men, right? Are they…what’re they like?”
Some of the Humans looked like they were regretting their choice to come to the city. The Gnoll and Drake exchanged looks.
“The Antinium? They are fine, yes? Just don’t ask Workers anything. Especially not their names. There will be an orientation. And the Antinium are fine. You will barely notice them.”
“But are there bugs? In the apartment? Or is it…”
“Buggy? Not at all. They were very clean, actually.”
The Gnoll [Builder] grinned. Some of the other Gnolls and Drakes chuckled. The Humans looked relieved. But that only opened the floodgates to more questions. Selys smiled as they began pelting the other Gnolls and Drakes in line with queries.
“So—there’s a Hive under the city? And that’s safe?”
“About the spring rains…”
“Is there anywhere to play? I can’t have the children running about the city or going outside, not with all those Shield Spiders and those horrible…rock…crabs!”
“Is she here? I mean, the [Innkeeper]? I was hoping to stay at her inn.”
Selys looked around. The husband of the family from Esthelm was talking to the Gnoll. The [Heiress] drifted closer as the Gnoll blinked at him.
“The [Innkeeper]? We have many, yes?”
“Well, yeah. But I mean…her. The one from—what’s the inn called? She was at Esthelm.”
The man was getting flustered. He turned to his wife and then back to the Gnoll.
“The young woman. Human? She runs an inn around here. I was told it’s fairly famous. And she’s a bit—off—”
“The Wandering Inn?”
The chorus came from every Drake and Gnoll in line. The Humans looked around. But Liscor’s citizens were nodding. Some smiled, some rolled their eyes, exasperated. But they knew the name.
“So it’s here? I asked, but someone said it’s not in the city.”
“It’s not. It’s just on a hill. Eastern gate. You can’t miss it.”
That worried the mother and the family intending to seek it out.
“It is safe? I’ve heard all manner of things about that inn. They say the [Innkeeper] ousted Commander Deint. She started a coup. Is that true?”
“Hah! I’d believe it.”
One of the Drakes laughed good-naturedly. A [Foreman] from Remendia blinked.
“That can’t be true. I heard about that inn, but the ‘magic door’ was closed in Celum, or so they said. There’s not really an inn around here that has one, right? Right?”
He looked around. The Drakes and Gnolls just grinned at him. One of the Drakes put a clawed hand on his shoulder and the [Foreman] jumped.
“Magic door? My friend. That is the least of what that crazy Human does.”
“So you all know her? You’ve met her?”
Selys smiled as the Humans asked questions. Most Gnolls and Drakes shook their heads, but a few spoke up. One Gnoll, a headband tied around his furry head, nodded.
“I’ve had a few dishes at her place. You know, she’s invented a bunch of rare foods? She’s a genius, that one. She makes new foods, and she plays that game. Chess. She’s beaten our own [Strategist] at it!”
“No she hasn’t. That’s just a rumor. He teaches her.”
Another Drake shook her head, looking put out. The first Gnoll snorted.
“She’s not a genius. She’s insane. Totally insane. She keeps Goblins in her inn, did you know? A bunch of them, in her basement.”
“I thought that was dead bodies. She’s a [Necromancer], too.”
“A [Necromancer]?”
