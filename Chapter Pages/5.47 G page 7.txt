“Maybe…can chase away biting bugs?”
Rags frowned.
“Maybe. That useful. Little bit. But stupid spell. Wanted [Fireball] instead. Can use this, but only for one thing. Starting campfires.”
“Mm. Is handy.”
The little Goblin raised her bowl threateningly, but Pyrite didn’t budge. After a while, Rags sat back. She stared up at the stars in the night’s sky. They were beautiful. She lay back and Pyrite ate his soup silently. Then, since Rags had only eaten half of hers, he picked up her bowl and began eating. She didn’t comment.
“I dreamed of him.”
“Who?
“Velan.”
Pyrite froze. He looked up at Rags. She lay on her back, staring at the night sky.
“Not much. Can’t see much. But looked for clue.”
“And?”
“He attacked other species. They attacked back. Killed his tribe.”
“Hmm.”
“Like this. We attack, we die.”
“Humans not kill us yet.”
Rags looked up and gave Pyrite a withering glance.
“Yet. They have plan. Then we die.”
“Mm. True.”
The two sat there a while longer. After he’d finished with Rags’ bowl, Pyrite piled the two up. He stared into the fire and then spoke.
“Forty three.”
“What?”
“Killed forty three Humans. In battle. Before other Humans came.”
Rags sat up. She stared at Pyrite. Forty three? By himself? Pyrite glanced at her. His crimson eyes were tired.
“I was angry. I killed Humans. Tried to kill the armored one. And a half-Troll. And the pointy-hat Human. Didn’t kill any. So I killed other Humans. Lots.”
“I didn’t kill any. Emperor got away. Tried to make surrender. Couldn’t. Was going to kill when others showed up.”
Pyrite looked at Rags. He shifted, poked the fire with a stick and sent sparks flurrying up.
“Emperor. What was he like?”
Rags closed her eyes.
“He—he strange. He was strange. He had—”
Rags struggled to find the words and then gave up. She showed Pyrite as she spoke in their tongue to him. The strange man—young!—with closed eyes. And yet how he seemed to see her. And his smile. The way he laughed and was sad. And defied peace despite the slaughter both knew it would bring.
The rest Pyrite knew already. Tyrion’s arrival, Redscar’s injury—that was the stuff of despair and legends. But Rags had not spoken to anyone of her meeting with Laken Godart. It hadn’t mattered, but it did matter at the same time. Pyrite nodded along. He looked at Rags as her shoulders hunched and her words ran dry.
“He told me he could not make peace. Because I killed his people. He was sad because he could not. And angry. Sad and angry. Not what I thought.”
“What did you expect?”
Rags paused.
“A monster. Wished he was one.”
Pyrite nodded. That would have made things so much easier.
“Pyrite?”
“Mm?”
He waited. Rags stared at her hands.
“Was killing them wrong? They killed us. We killed them. Was it wrong?”
“Don’t know.”
Pyrite answered honestly. He could still remember the anger. He could still remember the fury as he faced down the Humans. But he remembered Sir Kerrig and Welca as well. He didn’t know. He wished he did.
He looked at Rags. She was smaller than she normally seemed. Or maybe she was just letting her guard down around him. He searched for words to say that would make his Chieftain stronger, but he had none. Things had happened. There was no changing it. But it had gone poorly. And it wasn’t Rags’ fault. But she had been in command. Pyrite understood that.
The Hob sat restlessly. Rags could see him shifting now and then. She felt tired. Hollow. The weight of her tribe rested on her shoulders. It was…heavy. But Rags refused to cave in. She refused to give up.
