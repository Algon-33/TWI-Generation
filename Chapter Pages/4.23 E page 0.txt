“I can’t believe it. It was Odveig—I mean, Sacra, the entire time?”
“Yes, Durene. I didn’t realize it until it was too late. Damnit, I feel like an idiot—”
“But how? She didn’t act like—she was always so respectful and—and not like a spy at all! I thought Wiskeria was odd when you said she might be the one, but—Odveig?”
“The best spy’s one you don’t see coming, Durene.”
“And she works for Lady Magnolia? I mean…the Lady Magnolia?”
“You know her?”
“Everyone does. She’s Magnolia Reinhart. She’s…why’d she want you, Laken? Why’d she send Odveig?”
“I don’t know. Curiosity, maybe. Or—no, it’s no use questioning it. But now she’s gone and we could have really used her, Odveig’s abilities.”
“Yeah. You know, when she hit me, I didn’t feel a thing? She just tapped my head, like that, and it was…poof! What level do you think she was?”
“High. It was a mistake to confront her. Not that I knew it was her. Now Wiskeria’s afraid she’s trapped in some political game, and the adventurers are nervous. It was a mistake to do this now.”
“But you know who was causing trouble now, right? That’s a good thing.”
“Yes, but we don’t know why, Durene. We don’t know why and if she did anything else and what she’ll tell Lady Magnolia. We don’t know—and the Goblins are still out there.”
“Yeah. They shot arrows at Gamel when he was cutting wood. Everyone’s afraid.”
“I know.”
“Oh! But they know you’ll take care of it! You have a plan, right Laken? Right?”
“I—I have something, Durene.”
“What is it?”
“It’s—well, it’s just a guess. An idea, really. The Goblins are hiding, and I’ve been taking…steps…to deal with them.”
“Steps is good. But what…? Is it a secret?”
“No. Just stupid. I mean, it sounds stupid in my head. It’s got to do with Jelov. I’ll—you know what? It’s time. I have to try it. Otherwise we’re in trouble. We’ve lost Odveig, I mean, Sacra, Durene. Everyone’s afraid. It’s only a matter of time before someone tries to run or gets killed, or people try to replace me—either way, that’s when the Goblins attack and we all die.”
“I won’t let them do that. I’ll kill them. All of them. By myself, if I have to.”
“…”
“Laken?”
“I know you’d do that, Durene. But it’s my job to—to make things easier. I’ll do it tomorrow. And the situation with Wiskeria and the others—we’ll deal with it afterwards.”
“What if she’s, you know, angry I tried to hit her?”
“Then she can be angry. But she’ll obey. We’re only coming out of this one way, Durene, and that’s if we stick together. And I’ll do it. I’ll make us fight as one if I have to force everyone to do it myself.”
“Oh. That’s good.”
“Really? That sounds terrible to me.”
“Well forcing people, yeah…but you’re you, Laken. I know you’ll help everyone, even if it means twisting their arms.”
“Hah. You always know what to say, Durene.”
“…”
“…”
“Laken? Are we going to die?”
“…No, Durene. I won’t let it happen.”
“Good. But if we do, I wanted to—”
“Shh. Go to sleep.”
“But I wanted to—”
“I know.”
“I love you.”
“I know. I love you too.”
 
Day 69
 
Three attacks. Arrows flying out of the woods and Goblins charging a group of the villagers. Both times there were only wounded, not the dead—the Windfrozen Riders chased the Goblins away before they could do more than cut at the villagers.
And yet, the pain is still there. I can hear a man screaming and whimpering before the healing potion is applied sparingly to his leg. An oval of flesh had been carved off of his leg.
