Fast. Faster. So many potions. Ryoka threw one behind her. She didn’t know if she’d drunk it or not. Or if she’d even opened it. Had it been full? She staggered.
The ground was harder. Not dirt anymore. Ryoka looked around. Something—a bright blue shape beckoned her right. And ahead. Ryoka ran after it, as fast as she could.
The tunnel was getting longer. The darkness more profound. Ryoka paused to throw up on a rock. The rock moved, shouted, and kicked at her. She staggered.
“Sorry.”
“What the hell are you—what kind of trash Street Runner are you?”
The rock turned into a person. A staring Centaur. A Centaur. Ryoka focused on her as she wiped her mouth. The Centaur was standing and pointing at her filthy leg. Ryoka leaned on her.
“Sorry. Where am I?”
“Walta’s Runner’s Guild! You just came in here and—hey! HEY!”
Ryoka pushed past the Centaur Runner. Centaur Runner? The desk swam in front of her. She saw a woman rising behind it.
“Ryoka Griffin?”
“That’s me. I haven’t run in a circle, have I? Alime?”
Ryoka glanced around. The guild looked so familiar. The [Receptionist] shook her head.
“I’m not Alime. You’ve been running for hours. You outran three ambush parties.”
“I did? I didn’t even notice them. I—I have a delivery. For the Grandmaster of the Petal Knights. Sir Nathald.”
“I know. He’s on his way. You’re sick. Miss Griffin. How many potions did you take?”
“Six? Eight?”
Ryoka heard a mutter. The woman turned to a patch of darkness on Ryoka’s left, and then to her.
“Healing and stamina?”
“Maybe.”
“Help her throw up.”
“I’m fine. I did—”
Ryoka felt an unfriendly finger in her throat. She gagged. And then she did throw up. The world hazed out, and then stopped being so dark. Someone was offering her something. Ryoka tasted water. The [Receptionist] was bending over her when Ryoka looked up.
“The [Knights] are here for you, Miss Griffin.”
The young woman just wanted to lie on the ground. But somehow, that got her up. She clutched her side, the bag of holding she’d refused to let anyone touch.
“Okay. I have it right here. I’m—”
She got up with someone’s help. The [Receptionist] pulled Ryoka to her feet with the angry Centaur. She pushed Ryoka to a group of pink people.
“One more thing. Miss Griffin. You just ran seventy nine miles in less than five and a half hours. And that’s as the bird flies. You’ve passed the qualifying speed for a Courier.”
“Oh?”
Ryoka blinked at the woman. She turned and staggered past her.
“I had help. The wind’s with me.”
The arm holding her snorted. The half-horse girl dragged Ryoka forwards, her hooves clopping on the ground.
“Centaurs are faster. This one’s half-dead.”
“She outran three ambush parties. The first is wiped out. The other two never even caught her—”
“I never even saw…”
Ryoka blinked and stopped. Her vision swam clearer. A group of pink…[Knights] were assembled in front of her. Two dozen. A man with a grey beard and hair removed his helmet.
“Miss Ryoka Griffin?”
“That’s me. Who’re you?”
“Sir Nathald. We were told to expect you. You have a [Message] of utmost importance for us. Do you have proof of Lady Walchaís’ authority?”
“I do.”
Ryoka blinked. She shook her head and nearly fell over. Sir Nathald and the Centaur girl caught her. She stared hard at the [Knight].
“Do—do you have proof you’re all Rose Knights?”
The pink-armored [Knights] glanced at each other, bemused and amused. The Centaur snorted. Sir Nathald didn’t laugh. He reached out and offered Ryoka something.
“Here. Will this suffice?”
