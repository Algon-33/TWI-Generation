“I have a dream to go home. To find my family and live happily. But even if I do—I will never forget the things I have seen. Nerrhavia’s Fallen, my home. I asked if she knew. Her Majesty. She must. I have seen terrible things. I cannot go back and live in peace. Even if I was given the chance? I cannot.”
He stared down at the [Slavers] and people fighting. His eyes locked on the [Slaves]. On the [Slave Master]. The people in chains were watching Pisces, desperately. They had the eyes Rophir and the others had once had when they stared at Czautha. But Pisces was faltering.
“Bearig. You will surely die.”
The [Cook]’s shoulders were shaking. He was sweating.
“I know. But—I will not run. Better to die than be a [Slave]—no. No! I will never be a [Slave] again.”
He hefted the cleaver and looked at them.
“Such people—they deserve worse than death. All I will give them is death, if I can. Whatever it takes—in this next minute or year. I will be free. I am no [Slave]. Nor will I see anyone else be a [Slave]. No more collars and Riqres. Never again.”
He kicked his horse in the sides and the beast took him down the hill. Slowly. Then gathering momentum. Qshom hesitated. Eloque looked at the other [Slaves]. Some were already moving forwards. Rophir leapt off the saddle.
“Bearig!”
The Dullahan jerked and stared down. But Eloque was riding after Bearig next, then the others. The [Cook] charged, straight down. Some of the [Archers] saw and began taking shots at him from the walls. Most of the [Guards] ignored him. He was one man, face white, holding a cooking tool, not a sword.
But the [Slave Master] turned. His grin as he conjured more bindings and circled Pisces…faded. An odd, uncertain look entered his eyes as his head turned to stare directly at Bearig.
Perhaps he heard it. A sound under the light of day. A rarity that only occurred a few times. When you earned it. A temporary Skill.
A revelation from the divine.
And…it echoed in the [Cook]’s ears. A will as old as his people. A voice that had set the first of them free. From Elucina, to now.
 
[Slave class removed!]
[Rebel class obtained!]
[Skill – Mortal Enemy: Slavers obtained!]
[Skill —]
 
[Rebel]. He crashed towards the [Slave Master], who rode away from him, whip cracking.

They were still losing. But the sight of a mere [Cook] charging the enemy was enough. The Stitch-man spoke.
“I have seen enough.”
“Brother Izreal. There is nothing against—”
He whirled to the others.
“There is not. But there are contradictions. Were our own people not once [Slaves]? Were they not freed? Look. Those [Slaves] fight for freedom with courage. Roshal? There is no redemption in Roshal. I am called.”
“You must not make such decisions alone. You are not the will and voice and teacher.”
One of the other sixty stood up to confront Izreal. He met the uncertain gaze.
“I am certain. It lies in my heart and the heavens. Or do you fear the might of Roshal, Lazimeh? Is it not written? ‘Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or terrified of them. For it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will never leave nor forsake you.’”
His hands clasped together. The woman kneeling next to him looked up. Slowly, the Stitch-man drew a simple club.
“I hear his voice. As He is my witness. I will go alone and smite them if I must and answer to the [Prophet] alone.”
He turned and began walking towards the fighting. Horseless. He had simple cloth clothing and a simple weapon. They had been begging and preaching odd faith in the Glass Bazaar, and thus been exiled.
