But they had not prepared for the [Innkeeper] of Liscor. The Wind Runner of Reizmelt. Maviola of House El. Saliss of Lights. Their agents raced into place. And—

The adventurers were fighting a running battle with [Assassins]. They’d been headed for the Wind Runner, in pursuit. But they were caught.
“Get them!”
It was a Silver-rank team, who’d ambushed the group of three carriages of the Ranks. Not just them—a chariot raced ahead, with a second team in the center of the fight. The Silver-ranks loosed arrows, trying to catch up to the running battle.
Adventurers across the continent were fighting [Assassins]. This group had been racing north and west since the moment they had seen their friend.
The Horns of Hammerad. Pisces adjusted their course as Ceria blasted one of the coaches with ice magic.
“Dodge them, Pisces!”
“Do you think a chariot can turn that fast?”
The undead horses galloped without rest, but they couldn’t exceed themselves either. The [Assassins] were speeding up.
“Drop me!”
“Yvlon—”
The [Armsmistress] launched herself from the chariot. She hit the ground, caught herself, and brought up the sword.
“[Sword Art: Curve of the Moon]!”
The [Assassins] in the coach ahead of her were too slow—the arc of her blade smashed through the front of the coach. The coach stopped as the horses were knocked free of the vehicle. The Ranks, stunned, tried to exit the vehicle.
They ran into Yvlon. She blocked a sword thrust with one arm and her hand became spikes that pierced the [Assassin]’s arm. He screamed.
Ceria shouted at Pisces.
“Yvlon’s back there!”
“She jumped! I’ll animate the bodies! Keep—”
The crossbows thumped. Pisces and Ceria took cover. She raised an ice barrier around them, but it slowed the chariot. Two more coaches left. [Assassins] with crossbows leaned out of the doors as they drew alongside the three Horns of Hammerad. Aiming—
Ksmvr stood up. The [Assassins] had crossbows.
He had three. Each arm held one and the Ranks saw the Antinium open up his mandibles.
“[Threefold Shot].”
Instantly, one threw himself out of the carriage with a scream.
“[Greater Dodge]!”
What a great Skill. He might have been Level 20 if he was super lucky, or Level 30? Ksmvr saw the [Assassin] catch himself on the ground.
Huh? There had been no bolt—
Ksmvr shot him in the chest. The [Assassin] went down. Ksmvr sighed.
“Deficient.”
Everyone could say a Skill. He took aim.
“[Power Shot].”
The other [Assassins] had taken cover. Now—they hesitated. Was he bl—
Two crossbows fired. Ksmvr missed one [Assassin], tagged the other in the thigh. He sat back down and pulled more crossbows out of his bag of holding. Then happily stood up and fired again. Crossbow Stan’s tactics. Ceria popped up.
“Pisces!”
“[Shatterbolt].”
“[Ice Wall]!”
Another carriage down. The Horns circled back for Yvlon. The last coach turned to flee—Pisces pointed.
“[Acid Orb].”
He hit the wheels. The Horns regrouped and turned. They were too far away. But they were coming.
“Hold on, Ryoka.”
Ceria muttered. She looked up. In the distance—
The typhoon was creating a vortex in the skies.
 
—-
 
The world dropped away below her. Ryoka gasped.
They were gone. Maviola, Saliss. The Guild of Assassins, Alevica, Mavika—
Everything. At the end of it all, just as she’d told Lyonette and Erin…it did end this way. How would she deliver the cure to Tyrion Veltras?
Fly. She had known from the start that it wouldn’t be this easy. But neither had she expected the magical typhoon to unleash itself here.
