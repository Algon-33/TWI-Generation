Lyonette hurried through the door. Erin heard her raised voice. But the action was here.
“By order of the Watch! Stop that [Innkeeper] until—”
Zevara charged into the inn with a squad of [Guards] and Liscor’s Council. They stopped, as all three [Ladies] turned to them. Magnolia Reinhart opened her hands.
“Ah, and this must be Liscor’s esteemed Council! Do pardon me. I am Lady Reinhart. I couldn’t help but visit your wonderful little city.”
“Magnolia Reinhart?”
The name began to echo around the crowd. Erin saw a few people, like Drassi, looking confused. But the older inhabitants of Liscor started at the name. Lism, wheezing, leaned on the doorframe as Krshia’s eyes went wide with shock.
“Oh. Her. That busybody?”
But the rest of the adults stared at Magnolia, with awe. And Erin remembered—Magnolia had led the first defense of the city against the Antinium, breaking their siege long ago.
History. Watch Captain Zevara stared at Magnolia Reinhart.
“A [Lady] from the north is…may I ask why you’re here?”
“Just on a small errand. Watch Captain Zevara, I believe?”
“You—know my name?”
“Of course! Pryde, what are you so fascinated by?”
The [Lady of Pride] had ducked into the inn and was looking around.
“There’s a Hobgoblin over there. Also—there’s a room full of objects. Those weights you mentioned.”
“Yes, yes. You can investigate later. Wuvren?”
The [Eternal Beauty] was standing to the side. She turned.
“Just investigating, Magnolia. It was good to meet you…?”
“Belgrade. You are very beautiful. Goodbye.”
The [Tactician] stared after Wuvren. The two [Ladies] returned as Magnolia sighed. But—there came a figure. Nalthaliarstrelous didn’t stomp or curse in the Garden of Sanctuary. He emerged, looking thoughtful.
“Good plants. Young place. Why’d you pull me out?”
He glowered at the [Lady]. She opened her mouth and Nalthaliarstrelous turned away. He gazed around.
“Hm? Hm? Where are you?”
He peered around, suddenly, frowning. The [Druid] stared under a table. Then he whirled. And met a little Gnoll’s eyes.
Mrsha stared up at the [Druid]. Nalthaliarstrelous bent down. He stared, and his aggressive features—softened for a moment.
“You? Well met, little landfriend. You’re untaught, aren’t you? Strange. Is this your place?”
She nodded, solemnly. The [Druid], still ignoring Magnolia, straightened. He swept her a formal bow.
“My apologies for intruding. ‘Tis good land. Wondrous, terrible flowers. I am on my duties. Until then.”
He nodded to Mrsha. And she nodded back. Then, Nalthaliarstrelous turned. He looked at Magnolia. And suddenly, he was focused.
“Let’s go, then.”
Magnolia Reinhart sighed in relief. She nodded to Ressa, and Pryde and Wuvren.
“I believe the door takes us to Liscor. Ressa? Reynold?”
“Done.”
The [Maid] closed the door as the [Butler] stepped through. Erin saw them shut the door—at the last moment, the [Ladies] let go and she heard the exclamations from the other side.
“What the hell is happ—”
Then the door closed. Ressa adjusted the dial to Liscor, and opened it. Magnolia Reinhart sighed.
“How useful. Come, [Ladies]. And Liscor’s Council, Watch Captain, if you’d be so kind? Nalthaliarstrelous, lead the way.”
“Hmf. All stone. Disgusting. And there’s something beneath. Damn Drakes, messing up the land and burying damned dungeons all over the place…”
The [Druid] stomped through. Magnolia nodded, and Reynold and Ressa followed. Then she, Pryde, and Wuvren walked through. Erin felt the pressure on her release. She sat back.
“Wh—”
“After her!”
Lism shouted. The Council and Watch charged through. Erin sat on the ground.
“Wh—”
