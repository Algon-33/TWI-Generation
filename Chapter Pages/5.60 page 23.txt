Someone was coming. The Goblins froze. Was it Humans? No, that was a Redfang howl! Rags’ heart beat faster. She looked up and waved her arms as she saw a group riding hard towards them. They were headed past them, towards the High Passes! Had some Redfangs survived? She shouted and the other Goblins shouted as well. The distant riders spotted them and adjusted their course. Rags was grinning and so was Pyrite—
Until they saw who was leading the Redfangs. The Goblins froze and Ulvama screamed a warning. The Hobs and Goblins moved in front of Rags, grabbing at weapons. Pyrite tried to lift his battleaxe. But on the forward rider came. He was leading barely more than a dozen battered Redfangs. They had cut their way north past the Humans somehow. But though he was accompanied by only a fraction of his tribe, though he looked haggard and lost, there was still no mistaking him.
Garen Redfang drew up in front of Rags, his Carn Wolf panting. He stared down at the tense group of Goblins. And his eyes found Rags. The Redfang’s Chieftain stared blankly at Rags. Then he nodded.
“Hey.”

He had lost his tribe. He had been rejected by his warriors, old and new. He had confronted his team. And now he had nothing left. Garen Redfang stood with Rags as his warriors, exhausted and wounded, just lay down on the ground. They had ridden through magefire and hails of arrows. But somehow, incredibly, Garen had survived. Rags looked at the burns and fresh wounds on his body and wondered if he’d been trying to kill himself. If he had, he’d failed.
The two stood together. Pyrite and Ulvama watched Rags anxiously and stared suspiciously at Garen, but the Redfang Chieftain didn’t offer Rags any harm. He stood, looking blank and tired. Diminished. Rags stood with him, listening as Garen spoke of what had happened.
“So you go to High Passes?”
“Maybe.”
Garen stared past Rags. His Carn Wolf was lapping at some water being poured out of a flask. It was injured, but it had carried Garen all this way. Rags stared at the wolf as well and shook her head. She looked at Garen.
“You lost tribe.”
“Yes.”
He hunched his shoulders. Rags pointed towards Liscor.
“You betrayed team.”
“Yes.”
The Hob bowed his head.
“You betrayed me. And Reiss.”
“Yes. Yes.”
Garen closed his eyes. Rags stared up at him and then sighed.
“You are stupid.”
She saw one crimson eye open a crack and glare indignantly down at Rags. The little Goblin was unperturbed.
“You are. Stupid. And bad traitor. Bad Chieftain. Bad brother. Bad everything.”
“Can’t do anything about it.”
Garen gritted his teeth. Rags kicked him. This time Garen roared and made a fist. The Goblins tensed.
“Do you want fight?”
“No!”
Rags glared up at Garen. He relaxed slightly, but he was still furious.
“Then what?”
“Why are you running away? Why always running?”
Rags stared at Garen. He looked confused.
“Tribe rejected me. Nowhere to go. Halfseekers will kill me.”
“Yes. So why running? Why run?”
“Because nothing to stay for.”
“Except tribe. Except old team.”
Garen opened his mouth. Rags shook her head. She had it now. She looked at Garen.
“You betray. Always betray, you say. But it was you. You betray and betray. And then run away. But that is the problem.”
She pointed back, towards Liscor. Garen followed her finger. Rags spoke quietly.
“When you betray, you should stay.”
“And do what?”
“Fix things. Try. Be loyal. Be good.”
Garen looked back the way Rags was pointing. He looked at her. For a moment he hesitated and she hoped—but then he shook his head.
“Too late. Far too late to make things better.”
