“There’s a reason I feel like I have to do it. I know—it’s not someone I know. And Tyrion Veltras—but I’d try it even if it wasn’t him, and it didn’t help with the party. I’d want to.”
“Why? If it was Mrsha, I’d understand. But why for this?”
The Wind Runner sat back and stared at the ceiling. Her next words were slow, recited not from any one quote, but many.
“…It’s not my fight. It’s not my responsibility. Someone else will do what’s right. They won’t get away with this—but I’m not going to be the one to stop them.”
Lyonette looked up. Ryoka stared at her.
“We have a Guild…and a mysterious group of…people. Who are poisoning little kids to threaten a [Lord]. I don’t know the politics. I don’t care. I know what Tyrion Veltras did to Liscor. But that? That’s…”
Her pulse quickened. Her throat tried to close. Ryoka whispered.
“There’s evil. As clear as I’ve ever seen it. Am I supposed to walk away? If someone doesn’t fight that—they win. Why me? Because it’s happening. Everyone watches someone dying, someone doing something evil. And no one raises a hand.”
She shuddered, but the words were spilling out nonstop. Trying to contextualize who she had been, who she was. Make sense of it all.
“Earth is ruled by such things, Lyonette. We built empire on the bones of innocent people. There is so much happening in my world, every second I lived and breathed. Genocides taking place while people ignored it or claimed there were rules. People being murdered. Dying of starvation when someone could have fed them. Rapists and thieves who were protected. Criminals who used our laws. Petty and monstrously large alike. I could never do anything about it. I never properly tried. I just used it as an excuse to be angry and hit things.”
Erin Solstice sat outside, her head in her hands. Ryoka Griffin’s voice was rougher. Urgent.
“I felt helpless on Earth. But in this world, even without levels—I can try. I have a chance. I’ve done it before.”
The [Princess] said nothing. She and Ryoka were both shedding tears. It felt—too raw. Lyonette took a shuddering breath.
“I understand. And it might be wrong. But even if—can’t you let them die? Because I don’t want you to die. Do you understand that? You’re too important to us.”
The Wind Runner shuddered. She looked back. A Drake proudly raised her blade as the undead closed in. She saw a Courier, offering her a charm.
A laughing faerie.
She shook her head.
“The Ryoka Griffin who risked her life was the same one who ran to get a lost girl. I don’t want to become someone else. I’ll change everything. I’ll be a better person. But I want to be brave.”
The [Princess] choked.
“You already are. Bravery isn’t running to your death. Please.”
Ryoka had nothing left to say. Lyonette finished crying. She just sat there. Looking at Ryoka.
They understood each other better. So much more than ten minutes ago. The [Princess] wiped at her face.
“I could never do anything, either. I was a [Princess] without anything. I hated that. So I ran away. Now—I almost wish I was that old Lyonette. Because she was helpless. And she didn’t care. She didn’t have a child and she didn’t worry every night—I could stop you.”
“Yeah.”
“I could. I’d have Pawn and the Antinium hold you captive. But that wouldn’t change who you are. Or why Mrsha loves you. In the end—I won’t get in your way.”
Lyonette looked towards the door. Then she rose. She strode over to Ryoka—and kissed her.
On the forehead. Ryoka Griffin blinked.
“Wh—what?”
That was unexpected. She shoved Lyonette off, lightly. The [Princess] frowned.
“It didn’t work. Hold on—”
