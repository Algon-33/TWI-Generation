Lies. He read it in every line of her posture. Tense. Wary. The skeleton paused. This was all wrong.
Slowly, Toren looked at Erin. She waited, eyes flicking past him. The skeleton hesitated.
Then he opened his jaws. The ivory teeth parted. Toren spoke.
Erin.
Erin looked at him. The skeleton paused.
“Um, hello? Toren?”
She hesitated. Toren spoke.
It’s me.
But that was only a thought. Not sound. Again, Toren tried. He opened his mouth, but no words came out. He clattered his jaw, helplessly.
“Yes. It’s great to see you. Really cool. Um.”
Erin moved around the table. Toren watched her, turning his torso. She couldn’t hear him. He tried to speak. He tried with every fiber of his being. But he was voiceless.
How could he make her understand? The skeleton looked at Erin. Could he write on something? Did he even know how to write? He could read any language in the world. But could he…?
She didn’t understand him. Or maybe she did. Erin stared at Toren as his jaw opened and closed silently.
“What is it? What do you want to tell me, Toren?”
He just looked at her helplessly. That was what lay between them. Unspoken words. Did she know what he wanted to say? Could she read into his heart? He waited. Hoping.
Erin studied Toren. And this time, he saw that flicker in her eyes growing. Something staring behind the smile she gave him.
“Toren. I have something to tell you too. Let me just go get a thing real quick, okay?”
She tried to walk around the table, towards the door. He blocked her. The young woman halted. Stared into the skeleton’s eyes.
“Toren. Let me pass.”
The skeleton felt the order. He put out an arm. Blocking her. Erin looked at him.
“Huh.”
That felt good. Toren almost smiled. He opened and closed his jaws.
Erin. No, that wasn’t right.
Erin looked at Toren.
“I’ve heard a lot of things about you, Toren.”
So have I…mother.
A dark light flickered in the young woman’s eyes. She was breathing more slowly, and her voice was growing calm.
“I hear you did some bad things.”
Mother!
Toren screamed the word. He looked at Erin.
“You killed people. Is that true, Toren?”
Mother. Erin. Hello. Can you hear me?
The skeleton waited. Erin looked at him.
“Do you…understand me?”
He nodded. Erin’s eyes widened only a bit.
“Thought so. Then—answer my question. I heard you killed people. Is that true?”
The skeleton paused. Erin stared at him. Straight into his…he nodded. Then he tapped his chest.
Can you hear me? Can you—
The first punch knocked his skull across the room. Toren’s skeleton crumbled as Erin shouted.
“[Minotaur Punch]!”
His skull hit a broken beam, cracked. The rest of Toren jerked. Erin turned and ran for the door. She hurtled for it—and Toren leapt. His torso tackled Erin, bringing her down. His skull flew back towards his head. Erin fought, knocking Toren off him
Mother! Listen to me!
“Help! Help!”
Erin screamed, but there was no one around the abandoned inn. They were all playing baseball, far from the inn. She punched as Toren grabbed at her mouth.
No! Listen to me. Talk to me! 
But she heard nothing. She wasn’t listening. Toren saw a flash—he recoiled. The edge of Erin’s knife sliced through the front of his skull. So sharp.
Mother! Are you my mother?
Erin slashed at Toren as she tried to kick him off her. Her knife went through his bones like hot butter. But the mana in the inn was already mending them. Toren stared at Erin. How could they ever understand each other? He tore Pelt’s kitchen knife out of Erin’s hand. Flung it to one side as his bones began to mend.
