The answer came back so quickly that it was a shock. Sir Kerrig waited, but Pyrite said nothing more. He chewed and swallowed.
“To live? Surely there must be something else.”
Pyrite flicked his eyes up towards the trees above. He scratched at an insect bite, shook his head.
“No. To live. Tribe wants. Goblins want. To live. Nothing else.”
“But what is your tribe doing next?”
Pyrite frowned and Sir Kerrig wondered if he’d asked the wrong question. But Pyrite just shrugged. He pointed.
“Go that way.”
Both Humans turned and looked. They saw swamp, they saw trees. Dismayed, Sir Kerrig looked back at Pyrite.
“Sir Pyrite. We are your prisoners.”
“Mhm.”
Another pause.
“You’ve treated us well, with hospitality despite the lives we took. I must confess, I did not expect your tribe to be so—civilized.”
“Humans don’t.”
A deadpan reply. Welca glanced at Sir Kerrig’s slack expression and glowered at Pyrite.
“You Goblins have been raiding Human settlements for weeks now! Why?”
Pyrite raised an eyebrow.
“Not our tribe.”
“What?”
He turned and pointed another direction into the swamp.
“Great Chieftain of the Mountain City tribe raided. Not our tribe.”
“Are you serious?”
Pyrite looked blank.
“Am.”
“You’re lying.”
Welca glared at him. Pyrite blinked at her. The young [Knight] clenched her fist.
“Everyone knows Goblin tribes raid and steal constantly! This tribe attacked caravans!”
Pyrite nodded.
“Mhm.”
The [Knights] stared at him. Pyrite waited. After a while he popped more soap into his mouth.
“So?”
“So? You were lying!”
Welca burst out, enraged. Pyrite considered this.
“Not lying.”
“You said—”
The young woman made a strangled noise as Sir Kerrig gripped her arm. Pyrite shook his head.
“Didn’t lie.”
Before either Human could respond he continued.
“You said ‘raided settlements’. This tribe attacked caravans. Didn’t raid settlements. Attack settlement. One. Only took from caravans. Didn’t kill. Not like Mountain City tribe.”
“That’s splitting hairs! You can’t talk your way out of—”
Welca broke off as she realized what she was implying. She turned pale. Goblins? Arguing over the definition of language? Sir Kerrig eyed Pyrite.
“That was why we were summoned. You attacked a small town and killed a number of residents. You hung their bodies from the roofs.”
“Mhm.”
Pyrite didn’t seem to object to Welca’s fiery glare. He picked up another soap, sniffed it. Sir Kerrig waited.
“Why?”
The Hob paused.
“Killed Goblin tribe.”
“Who?”
“Human town. Killed Goblins. Killed adults, killed children.”
The two Humans looked at the Hob. He didn’t meet their glances. Slowly, his claw sank into the soap and he tore a piece off. Chewed it. Swallowed.
“So you killed them?”
“Mhm.”
“For vengeance?”
Welca’s hot tone made the Hob look up.
“They killed Goblins. We killed Humans. Same number.”
“How do you know?”
The Hob’s eyes flashed crimson.
“We counted.”
Silence. The swamp was humid, but the sweat on Sir Kerrig’s skin was only due in part to the climate. Pyrite’s expression changed back to normal and he sat, once again a quiet, affable Hob content to eat soap. Welca tried to find a response.
“It wasn’t your tribe, though, was it?”
“No.”
“Did you know them?”
“No.”
“Why did you do it, then?”
Pyrite stopped eating soap and met Welca’s eyes.
“They killed Goblins. Why did you come to kill us?”
Because Goblins killed Humans. It was a simple logic. Silence. Sir Kerrig felt sweat rolling down the back of his neck. Pyrite seemed content just to sit there. His ears flicked as he glanced at Welca. She stared at him. The Hob slapped a fly that landed on his arm.
