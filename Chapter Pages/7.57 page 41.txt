Erin Solstice saw Maviola El’s eyes widen. She sensed…Erin looked around. Three? She noticed too late.
Fierre bit her lip so hard her teeth nearly met. Mithril dust. That was one of the ingredients for—it was so rare you only needed it for a few things. So the Guild could watch whoever bought it.
They had been. But—it had never occurred to them that the enemy of Tyrion Veltras might—
“Oh no.”
She looked about. And there she sat. Ryoka Griffin’s head rose.
“I—I think I’ve made a mistake. I’ll…just be going. Saliss. Ahem. Sorry for the misunderstanding.”
Xif began to back up. Saliss gave him a wide, happy smile.
“I’m going to burn your shop down for real this time, Xif. Promise. Well…I suppose the cat’s out of the bag. Who does that, anyways?”
He spread his arms wide. His claws open. He turned—
“I suppose I should come clean, Erin.”
She looked up at him. The [Alchemist], Saliss, looked at her kindly.
“Saliss?”
“He seemed so sad. And I was bored. Sometimes…”
The Drake looked at her sincerely. Then he bowed.
No, he folded up in slow motion. A dagger stood out in his claws—he’d caught it at the last moment. The [Alchemist]’s hands blurred.
Something flickered past Erin’s face. A thin stream of—an [Assassin] collapsed. Octavia stared at the Drake screaming, clutching at his face as the acid burned.
Another leapt—but the second jet of acid struck him across the chest and he screamed. The first was already dead, smoking. The third [Assassin] ran for the door, pushing past Liska.
“And here we go. Excuse me, Erin.”
Saliss of Lights walked for the door. The [Assassin] was fumbling for the stone. He whirled—Saliss blew more acid across his face.
“A solution to 90% of my problems.”
He laughed. Liska backed away from him, eyes wide. Saliss adjusted the dial. And walked into Invrisil.
Drama. A frozen inn. Badarrow was aiming his bow at the strange Drake’s back. Numbtongue was tense in his seat.
“What—what was—”
Xif stared in horror at the dead [Assassins]. But someone moved in the silence.
“No—stop—”
Fierre was too slow, for once. Ryoka tore out of her grasp. She followed the Drake.
Through the door. Into the street. The Drake had left a hole in the crowd. He was walking—
The loitering pedestrians. The casual gangs. They turned, appraising the sudden shouting. The crowd. They saw the naked Drake coming at them. Sauntering down the street.
They were not prepared for Saliss of Lights. He had two jars in his hand.
“Come on! Try it! I bathe in acid! No, really, I do. Keeps the scales polished.”
The [Alchemist] was shouting. The [Assassins] hesitated.
Three tried it. Saliss hit them with acid so fast they were screaming—then still, smoking forms on the street. He walked on.
Straight into the Runner’s Guild. The [Receptionist] stared as the Drake paused to do a victory dance.
“Hey. I’m Saliss. Look, I know this isn’t common. But—here.”
He handed her a vial. The [Receptionist] stared at it. At him. Saliss dangled it, then put the clear liquid on the receptionist’s desk.
“W-wh-wh—”
What is that? But she didn’t need an answer. She knew. They all knew. Runners, Couriers, [Assassins], and more, oh my. Saliss of Lights turned. And on his smile—Ryoka Griffin stopped, panting.
“I believe that was one cure for Lord Tyrion Veltras. Delivered! Just looking for a good Runner to bring it.”
Saliss leaned on the counter. He looked around, still holding the acid. Waiting.
“So? Any takers?”
