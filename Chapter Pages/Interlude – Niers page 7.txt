Interlude – Niers
Page 7
“Well, give it back. It’s no use now. I shouldn’t have written it down without warding it anyways. You could be scryed.”
“Good joke.”
“Even you could be. Come on.”
Niers held up his hands, but Foliana hesitated. She looked at the paper and then smiled slightly.
“Won’t. I’m going to show all your students so they’ll be really impressed. They’ll keep the secret, mhm. But be impressed.”
“What? Absolutely not! Give that back Foliana, right now!”
The Fraerling leapt surprisingly high, but Foliana stepped back from the table and that was that. She retreated to Niers’ door.
“Going to show them now. Bye.”
She faded from view. But Niers knew she was there and he saw his door open. He roared in fury.
“Dead gods damn it, Foliana! Give that back!”
She made no reply. She was moving and Niers had known Foliana for so long that he could vaguely guess where she was. And where she was going. He leapt from his table, landing lightly on the ground and raced after Foliana. For a small person his voice was very loud.
“Get back here! I could be wrong! This is my reputation on the line! Foliana! [Rapid Advance]!”
He charged after Foliana. She ran through the citadel, and Niers’ students and his subordinates and staff were treated to the Titan running after his commander through the hallways, furiously shouting at her. But Foliana didn’t slow. She ran on, smiling. And despite Niers’ escalating threats, he was smiling too. They were, after all, friends. So Foliana ran and Niers chased.
She was still naked.
