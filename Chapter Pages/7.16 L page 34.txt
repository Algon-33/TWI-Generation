Did you know…?
The Antinium stared at the sky. Despair. 
Did you know? That you can learn Skills? Just from training? Just from combat?
And there was a voice. It might have come from above. From heaven, if he believed. But it came from below. From inside Klbkch.
From hell, where the First Queen had died. And it spoke to him. Like her voice, which he remembered. He had never forgotten.
 
[Skill – Recaptured Sublimity learned].
 
The Antinium stared up at the sky. And slowly, he rose.
“Klb, please…”
Relc was pleading, his voice hoarse from shouting. But he—stopped.
His [Dangersense] had been telling him about the fight. Yet, Relc had tuned out what he knew. Now though—it sounded. But more than that. He was a warrior. He felt it.
So too did Zevara. She stopped, one clawed hand out. And she stared.
“What…is that?”
The Antinium was broken. Beaten. Bloody. His green blood dripped down onto the cobblestones. But—suddenly—Zevara was afraid.
The crowd felt it too. 4th Company stopped chanting, abruptly. Chaldion, who had looked away from the meaningless end, turned back. The Dragonspeaker stopped smiling. Rafaema saw the Antinium look at Relc. He walked forwards, slowly.
“A. Moment. A. Gift.”
That was all Klbkch said. Relc hesitated. The Gecko of Liscor tensed, more serious than he had been any time before. This time, he struck first.
A leap. A punch, as fast as he could move. [Triple Thrust]. For the first time Relc used a Skill.
Three punches, simultaneously. The kind of blow even veterans might not block.
They never landed. The Antinium was inside Relc’s guard. The Drake saw a flash. Something even he couldn’t see.
So f—
A blow. Relc felt something burst in his jaw. His teeth nearly cut his tongue in half. He staggered, but he kept moving.
So—
A blow on his chest. Something that went through his armor Skills. Compressed his ribs. Blood—the Drake choked.
S—
He went flying backwards. Hit 4th Company. They stared. Embria turned.
“Dad…?”
The Antinium was advancing. The Drakes and Gnolls stared as Relc tried to get up. He stood, shakily—
The Antinium hit him. He punched Relc through the spectators, into a wall. And then—his hands were blurring. Embria heard the sounds before she realized what it was.
The wall was cracking as he drove Relc into it. The Drake was being hit in the chest, stomach—too fast for Embria to keep up.
For a second no one moved. Then Captain Wikir of 1st Squad moved. He leapt forwards at the same time as Vell, Pielt, and the other officers and [Soldiers] of 4th Company present. They surged at Klbkch, duel forgotten.
It was instinct. Something—Embria was moving too. She saw Klbkch grab Wikir. He swung the Gnoll into a wall.
Something went crack. Stone, and bone. The Antinium blocked a punch, hit Pielt so hard Embria thought she heard his jaw breaking. No—it was—
She had a spear in her hands. Embria realized she was stabbing as the [Soldiers] reeled backwards, taking blows she hadn’t seen. The Antinium turned.
He dodged the spear. As fast as Relc’s best attack. Embria saw him moving as Vell howled and attacked.
Unconsciously, the Wing Commander, the [Spear Hunter] moved her spear. Impacts. She felt herself flung backwards. She’d blocked—she saw the Antinium moving. A blow at her ribs. Embria felt—
 
—-
 
Watch Captain Zevara saw the last of 4th Company falling. Embria was lying on the ground. Klbkch stood amid the [Soldiers]. He had swung at the Drake’s ribs. But he hadn’t shattered them. Punched through her.
