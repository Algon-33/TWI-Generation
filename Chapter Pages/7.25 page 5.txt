He screamed. The [Guards] hesitated. The covered wagons were moving too slowly, even divested of their cargo. The [Head Guard] pointed.
“Go!”
The escort fled, abandoning the wagon. The [Merchant] howled.
“Don’t you dare—”
Then he saw his people fleeing the caravan. Two jumped off and ran after the [Farmer]. Another hid in the grass. Half stayed with him, frantically tossing out everything to lighten their load. But his best assistant, a [Trader], took her wagon off-road, tossing everything out of it. The [Merchant] gaped around.
This wasn’t happening. He tried to lash the donkeys to make them move faster, but the stubborn animals refused to move faster—the [Merchant] looked back down the road.
“Faster. Faster—it’s just normal [Raiders].”
He tried to whisper to himself. He urged his wagon down the road as his trade goods, his life’s work, scattered behind him. Maybe it would slow—
The [Merchant] glanced back when he saw a group of four figures on the road. Riding towards him—no—one was running. His blood froze. He felt for a Wand of Light Arrows, hands shaking.
“They’re supposed to be dozens. Dozens! It’s not them. It’s just—”
An arrow passed through his forehead and straight through the other side. The [Archer] on the flying carpet crowed as the [Merchant] toppled off the wagon and the terrified donkeys slowed. The [Raider] raised their bow and shouted down at the others as they charged.
“That’s one for me!”
Then they shot forwards. The bow was raised and after firing another shot, they pulled out the Wand of [Fireballs] and shot another.

Three minutes ago.
They were indeed having fun. It was rare a Bloodfeast was called; after all, they were all infamous criminals. But—they reveled in their notoriety.
And as Ryoka had seen, their motives were basic. Simple. The [Raider] with the daggers was full of good ideas.
“A contest!”
They laughed and clapped their hands together. The [Raider] looked around at the others.
“Whoever hits the most with projectiles. Wands only. Winner claims—their pick of the spoils or whatever-this-is. Agreed?”
They waved the iPhone at the others.
“I’ll use my bow and wand.”
Their leader immediately countered. The others grumbled. The one with the spear shook their head.
“I don’t use wands.”
“Oh, be that way. Then—just total kills. Agreed?”
“How do we keep count?”
“If we all see it, it counts. Otherwise—take heads.”
“I’m not carrying heads. But I want that thing! Agreed! Most kills wins! Anything goes!”
As they spoke, the [Raider] with the scroll unrolled it, grumbling.
“[Clear Weather]. So they can see us coming. It was hard getting two of these. I want a bigger share of the loot. Think we gave that City Runner a head start?”
“I hope so! I like her. What if—hear me out. What if she survives and gets away from us? Then—I’ll hire her to deliver something.”
“You would. How long does she get? If I find her, I’m capturing her.”
The others laughed, clearly taken by the idea. Another checked the skies.
“Might be five minutes. Or three. I don’t care. Let’s go!”
They shot forwards on their horse. The other [Raiders] shouted and followed, their little promise to Ryoka forgotten.
They flew or rode or ran, casting [Fireballs] that exploded as the rainfall ceased. The [Raider] with the bow fired an arrow as they rose higher on their carpet. One of the other Bloodfeast Raiders flew beside them, checking their magical daggers.
The arrow went through the [Merchant]’s head. The bow was magical as were the arrows. The leader crowed as they celebrated.
