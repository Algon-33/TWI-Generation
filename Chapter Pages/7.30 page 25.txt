“I’ve never done that before, you know.”
“Really? It was beautiful.”
“Yes. But it’s also intimate. As you well know.”
Erin smiled ruefully.
“Yeah. That was. Wow. I’m—sorry for head butting you. Uh—are you okay?”
The [Lady]’s eyes widened. She started laughing again and plucked at her arm.
“What? Oh—this isn’t an illusion. I’m fine. I’ve taken worse blows before.”
“Phew. Thank goodness.”
Erin shook her head. She kept staring at Maviola. After a second, Erin opened her mouth.
“—You’re a [Lady]. A Lady.”
She meant it in another sense. She had seen Maviola in a ballroom, greeting [Kings], even having royalty treat her like an equal. Leading armies. But she wanted Maviola to say it. The [Lady] inclined her head. She took a breath.
“True enough. Let me say it, then. My name is Maviola El. And I hope you will let me teach you in the time I have left, my successor of fire.”
Erin’s breath caught. El. Even she knew the Five Families. But she had known the instant she stared into the fire.
“You mean…?”
“I was…once…the matriarch of the House of El. Lady Firestarter, my nickname. Maviola and Fulviolo El. My brother was always the responsible one. But he had to die and I had to take charge. That was over a decade ago. Before that? I was a wild girl. I fought in a few wars. I had quite a fun time. I never managed to find someone to settle down with. But there were enough children in my life. That is me. And you?”
The [Lady] looked at Erin. Her soul bared. The fire had been the most intimate exposure of her past that Erin had seen. By contrast, the words just reaffirmed that truth. Erin’s hand shook.
“But you look—”
“A Potion of Youth. Wonderful things. Your [Alchemist] friend made them. Saliss of Lights can restore even someone as old as me into a young body. For a while.”
Maviola laughed at Erin’s expression. Erin sat back, holding her head.
“No way. But you were old. I mean—sorry—but you were!”
“Dreadfully old! I was bound in my wheelchair. See?”
Maviola flicked a finger. A dusty, grey flame appeared. Erin saw Maviola sitting in her wheelchair. Experienced it. She felt bound, too weary, incapable of rising. Her very bones ached, despite the tinctures and potions. Erin felt the aged frustration even as she jerked her eyes away.
“No—stop it.”
“I’m sorry.”
“That’s awful.”
The woman’s lips quirked.
“It gets better. Your body betrays you. The worst part is remembering what it’s like to run about. And half-Elves getting to live far longer. I was so jealous.”
“But how—”
“Magic. Alchemy. Surely you’ve heard of magical spells?”
“But that’s—”
Erin had seen [Fireballs]. Powerful spells. Even undead. But this seemed grander than the rest. Maviola nodded.
“That’s mundane. Saliss of Lights is one of the world’s greatest [Alchemists]. He stands at the cusp of rediscovering true wonders. The kind that reversed aging. Potions that could allegedly bring back the dead, give the drinker wings. Transform them from one species into another. That is true alchemy.”
“Wow.”
The [Innkeeper] sat back. She was taking it all in. But Maviola was looking at her.
“You’re so surprised. But you’ve seen so much yourself. I saw it, in your fire. Will you…show me?”
Erin jerked. Her heart pounded at the simple request. Still, Maviola had shown her so much. Shyly, Erin raised a hand.
“I can’t do it like you.”
“That’s quite alright. If you could, I wouldn’t be here. What can you do?”
“Um—happiness is hardest.”
“It is.”
“This is—easy. Depression fire. See?”
A blue flame appeared in Erin’s cupped palms. Maviola’s smile faded. She stared into Erin’s fire. And saw—
