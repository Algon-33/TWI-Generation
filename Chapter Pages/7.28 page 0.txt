[Guardsman Level 17!]
[Skill – Eyes In The Back obtained!]
 
The Drake opened his eyes as the sun hit his head. Sometimes the announcement came in the mornings. If he fell asleep and it didn’t wake him up, it lingered in his mind. Like words seared onto the inside of his brain. He blinked a few times.
Then made a fist and punched it up in victory.
“Ooh. Noice.”
“What was that?”
“Nothing. Well, actually…”
Relc rolled over and Ryoka blinked at him. She was there too of course. And while level-ups had never troubled her, the Drake was only happy to explain.
“I leveled up. Twice, actually. In two classes.”
“Oh—congratulations.”
“Thanks. And uh—”
They stared at each other. Ryoka was in the same bed as Relc. Of course, he had known that. He hadn’t drunk enough to forget last night either. A good thing, despite how his day had gone.
Sunlight was streaming through an unfamiliar window. Relc blinked around at the nice room. It wasn’t his. It was, in fact, Ryoka’s. True to form, he hadn’t woken up in his apartment. This room was better, anyways. The sun was rising and he’d slept through his dawn routine for once.
Probably because he’d been stabbed multiple times. And for other reasons. The Drake was explaining his new level—he already felt like he had a vague sense of what was behind him. Just a wall, and the sunlight. Not like ‘eyes’ but—better than intuition.
“Yeah, that’s me. I’m going to be even harder to jump. Nice Skill—although Klbkch always had my back.”
“Right. You said.”
Ryoka sat up. Relc stared at her. She blinked a few times. And blushed. A bit embarrassed by the stare more than anything else.
“So uh…nice room.”
“Yup. Erin’s giving it to me rent-free.”
Both of them latched onto the trite conversation. But after a second of looking around, Relc decided it was a good topic.
“Really nice. Good bed, more spacious than my apartment—do you know how much she charges?”
Ryoka paused as she looked around for clothes. She found her bag of holding. There was a skittering sound from outside the window.
“Er…ask Lyonette. But ask Erin if you want a deal. I’m sure she’d give it to you cheap.”
“Yeah. Yeah…I might like living here. Y’know, if Erin has room. I’d help out! Kick Rock Crabs and stuff. But it’d be nice. You could swing a spear around in here.”
Ryoka glanced around. Relc frowned. Instantly, he began to panic.
“…Where’s my spear?”
“I think your daughter has it.”
“Oh. Right. Right.”
The Drake relaxed. Normally, he wasn’t out of reach of his spear at any time. He thought about his other new Skill. Should he…?
Nah. It’d probably try to come to him if he wasn’t out of range. And you didn’t want to get in between a recalling spear and the target. He lay back. Then sat up.
“I should go. Really cool and all—”
Ryoka glanced at him. The Drake stared around vaguely for his clothes. But propriety demanded he soon exit. To his surprise—Ryoka hadn’t suggested it already.
“I’m good.”
“Oh? Really?”
“Mhm.”
“Cool, cool. I uh—can jump out the window—”
“Or walk down the steps. Do you often do this?”
“…Sometimes?”
The Drake had run the gamut from every kind of morning after. Good, bad—this was already shaping up to be a good one. Bad ones were where the angry lover hit you in the middle of your sleep.
The two looked at each other. Ryoka—who had thought this was all a great idea yesterday—was mostly perturbed by her brain. What did you say? She was out of practice—and she actually knew Relc. She was clearing her throat—when the skittering grew louder.
