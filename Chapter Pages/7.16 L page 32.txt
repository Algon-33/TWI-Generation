Or before. They were moving so fast, exchanging so many, that the words and impacts were one and the same.
“You’re wrong, buddy.”
Relc dodged around Klbkch’s punch. He was—quick. The [Sergeant] hit Klbkch across what were supposed to be his ribs.
Chitin broke. Klbkch saw him moving left.
Kick to the side. He twisted—but the blow still caught him. Relc jumped after Klbkch, kicking.
“You’re such a smart guy. How are you so stupid? I’m supposed to be the stupid one. Well—not stupid, but—”
A punch. Grunt. Klbkch felt the blow. Heavy. But Relc’s head just snapped back. He shoulder-charged Klbkch. He didn’t stop.
He was the Gecko of Liscor. And without his blades, Klbkch only had his fists. Two of them. And Relc—another blow, and the Antinium rolled. He saw Relc waiting.
“Klbkch, buddy. You helped me. I’m trying to help you. This is the only thing I know. Because I’m sort of an idiot. Just a bit.”
Stop talking.
Klbkch didn’t know if he said it or thought it. He was shaking. His vision felt—clouded. For all it was clear. Look at him. Look at them, watching.
The cheering Drakes, enjoying him being hit. The ones watching through the orb. The pedestrians. Not all looked triumphant. But look. Klbkch saw it all.
They weren’t his. He just pretended to be part of this place. He wasn’t. They were his enemies. This was just an act. So much work. Decades.
To try to fix broken Hives. A remnant of glory.
Broken fools. Infighting Queens. Worthless. Klbkch lunged. Relc cross-countered him in midair. The Drake leapt back.
Too slow. His new body was faster than the last one, incomparable to the Worker’s flawed form. But still, too slow. Too slow compared to what he had been.
He had lost it all. Klbkch swung, saw a punch. Saw, knew where it would land. But he couldn’t block it.
Another blow, sending him sprawling. Relc said something. He was trying to talk to Klbkch. But the Antinium was just—
So weak. He had lost it all. His people. His true Queen. His body, his levels.
All of it. 
Klbkch hit the ground again. And he raged. But it was dull. Even his anger, after all this time. He was a shadow.
And the shadow saw where he should move. He saw—but he was too weak.
He would never reach the center of the hell. Even in his glory, they only reached it once. When the First Queen had died.
He had died there. So had Xrn. The first time. All of them. That day, hope, the heart of the Antinium had been snatched away.
By it. Their enemy. And all of this? The Drakes? All—
Klbkch felt a fist, punching him down. He didn’t remember standing. He saw Relc talking again.
Shut up, shut up, shut up. You don’t know anything. You don’t know what I’ve lost.
But there they were again. All of them, Relc, the Watch, the Antinium—even Erin. The Free Queen. They pretended like they knew him.
But none of them had been there. None of them knew. None of them knew the depths of his rage. The despair. What he fought for. A dream. Vengeance, justice.
What had kept him living. He had despaired, once. And sought death at the hands of Goblins.
But—how he raged, now. Raged at the arrogant watchers. At Relc. You don’t know what I was. How dare you judge me by your rules.
Even her. He could sense her, talking to him. The Free Queen. Asking—but she was flawed too.
He was alone.
Lead them. Train these false copies. The imposters.
That was what part of Klbkch said. Learn from Relc, what the Drake was trying to say with his fists, from Erin. But the rest, the old him, screamed something else.
Make an example. Tolerate them? These flawed, pathetic things calling themselves Antinium?
