Ressa accompanied Lady Magnolia to the second floor. The other [Assassins] and [Maids] remained below, awaiting Magnolia’s orders. She had no fear. Her Head Maid was enough of an escort even if Ryoka should prove belligerent, and of course a [Lady] had her own means of defense.
But Magnolia did not anticipate much trouble. Or rather, she expected she could handle whatever trouble emerged with her own Skills. She stopped in front of Ryoka’s door and knocked.
No response. Magnolia exchanged a glance with Ressa and she tried again, more loudly.
Again, there was no response. Magnolia frowned. She would have expected Ryoka to notice the inn’s occupants being roused, but ah, perhaps the girl was being stubborn. Very well.
Lady Magnolia raised her voice.
“Good evening Miss Griffin. May I come in?”
There was no response.
Strange. Lady Magnolia knew that should have worked. She raised her voice.
“Ryoka, my dear? Hello? Is anyone there?”
Dead silence. Lady Magnolia frowned.
“…Hello?”
