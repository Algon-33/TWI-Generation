Well, here’s the part I don’t like about talking to people. I open my mouth to give her a bland response. What should I say? Running is hard, but fun? It can be rewarding, but you just have to put the hours in? Some bland, useless reply like that so I can change the subject back to the others.
But I stop. I hesitate. Do I have to say that? It’s a stupid line that won’t mean anything. I hate that kind of conversation. So why should I say it?
Running. Is it fun? Sometimes. Running is fun, but being a Runner isn’t. The petty rivalries, my shattered leg, and the way Runners seem to be more cowardly than adventurers—it’s hard to just gloss over that.
So why not tell her? What was it Louis C.K. said in one of his monologues? Screw the ordinary conversation, the meaningless chatter. Let’s just have a real talk.
What’s the worst that can happen? I lose my friends? I don’t have any. It’s awkward? We’ve already had enough awkwardness to fill two swimming pools.
It’s not me. I don’t chat with people. I don’t talk. But today—
Today is different.
So I begin to speak. Erin blinks as I begin talking about running, frankly, and without sparing the details.
“You had your leg shattered? By a moving—”
She glances down at my leg. You can’t even see the scars. That’s magic for you.
“And you went to the High Passes? Where’s that?”
“It’s the other gateway to the southern part of the continent. Haven’t you heard of it?”
“I uh, don’t know much about the local geography. Or politics. Or…anything.”
Huh. Sounds a bit like me. I keep talking. Somehow, she’s pulling the words out of me.
“You fought a Silver-ranked Adventurer? Barehanded? No way.”
When did I say that? My face is getting hot. She probably thinks I’m bragging but—Erin leans over the table, eyes sparkling.
“That’s so…cool. Tell me another story!”
I blink. She’s so interested. It’s just life to me. And depressing, at that. I remember what happened afterwards, my mistakes. How can I feel proud of that? But then, why not explain that bit?
I try, but Erin shakes her head. Her smile flickers and she looks me dead in the eye.
“That’s not bad. I mean, it’s not good, but I’ve done worse. Way worse. I…got a friend killed.”
“How?”
For once, I want to know. Erin pauses, and sighs. She grabs the cup she brought and drinks long and deep. Somehow, we’ve run out of blue juice and there’s several empty plates in front of both of us.
“It’s a long story. It starts with—well, I guess it starts with Goblins.”
“Goblins?”
“Goblins. And there’s acid flies, you know, the one of the menu? And talking bug men and—okay, do you believe in Dragons? Krshia—she’s a Gnoll—she says they don’t exist, but I saw one, I swear.”
Erin begins to talk. It’s a confusing story, but I listen, asking the right questions. Not just the right questions. The questions I want to know, the little details. It’s not a boring conversation. It’s not trite dialogue. It’s real. It’s engaging.
She knew The Horns of Hammerad before they died. She was there. And she’s not just a boring person. She’s someone.
It’s—odd. Her story is bothering me. Erin Solstice. Is she—it’s an odd story. But I’m too tired to think straight. I’ve been running all day and I’m tired. But her story calls to me. There’s something about Erin. I’ll think about it later.
“Have you ever seen a Gnoll? They’re like giant hyenas that get really angry. And they sniff you. A lot. Have you ever heard one of them sneeze? So weird.”
I listen. And I’m smiling. It hurts because I’m out of practice.
But I’m smiling.
I wish I could stay.

“I should go.”
