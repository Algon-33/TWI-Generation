He released the pressure at once. But then Kevin was moving. He knocked the others aside.
“Slow the blood! Pressure—”
He joined Numbtongue on the ground. He pushed down and blood bubbled up. Numbtongue heard a cry. But Kevin was shouting.
“Push!”
Numbtongue obeyed. Rose and Joseph stood there, staring. Rose half-knelt.
“She’s shot in the stomach. Potions can’t…?”
“Poison. They used poison. You can’t heal it until it’s purged. W-what do we—?”
Montressa looked around. Rose gasped.
“Tourniquet! That’s what you do. You make—how do you make one?”
She looked at Kevin. The young man didn’t respond.
“Bandages! Someone get bandages! Joseph! Get your shirt off! Someone help us! Get a [Healer]! Get—”
He roared. Numbtongue heard a cry. Mrsha. She had seen. Moore hovered there pale. Someone shoved past him.
Snapjaw. She had bundles of towels, cleaning cloths, anything she could grab. She threw it down.
“Press! Stupid Goblin! Press!”
She shrieked at the others. Numbtongue obeyed. The cloth turned red. He reached for the bolt and Snapjaw knocked his hand away.
“Leave!”
Of course. He knew that. But he felt—
“I’m shot? Poison?”
Erin was murmuring. She didn’t understand. Her eyes were fluttering. She was biting her lip, trying not to scream. Kevin bent over her.
“Don’t move, Erin. It’s going—press! Can’t we get rid of the poison?”
He looked at Snapjaw desperately. The Hobgoblin looked around. Montressa was staring down at Erin. Rose grabbed her, shaking her arm.
“Get a healing potion! Do something! Cast a spell!”
“What spell? I didn’t study healing—”
The [Aegiscaster] jerked away. Bezale knocked both to the side.
“Pressure! [Healer]! Get a damned [Healer]! Go! Run!”
She bellowed at Montressa. She and Rose ran. The others looked on as Beza joined the group clustered around Erin.
They had no idea what to do. Only the Goblins, Beza, and Kevin had any clue.
“Press! It has to clot! We need a blood transfusion! [Healer]! Get Pallass!”
“Octavia! There!”
Lyonette shouted. She was dragging the [Alchemist] out. The Stitch-Girl stopped.
“W-what?”
“Help her!”
“How? Poison? Where is it?”
Lyonette ran forwards. She snatched up the bolt, shoved it at Octavia.
“Find an antidote!”
“Where do I…? From this?”
“Go!”
Octavia stumbled backwards. Numbtongue was staring at Erin’s face. And he saw more blood dripping from the sodden cloth. Snapjaw made a sound.
“Stay awake. Erin. Stay awake.”
“She’s—she’s losing too much blood. I think they hit an artery or a vein. Magic. Use a spell.”
Kevin pleaded with Beza. He looked around. Montressa had forgotten to run for the [Healer].
“Healing magic was lost millennia ago. There are spells like [Restoration], but that’s at least Tier 6 magic.”
“There has to be something. Cauterize the wound!”
“W-what are we supposed to do? Burn her? We’ll burn out her stomach just trying!”
Montressa spluttered. Palt looked around. Menolit was pounding towards the magic door.
“Liscor! Liscor—”
The Centaur slowly raised a finger to his head. Badarrow shoved past him, dropping his bow. Bird was behind him. They’d only now descended the stairs.
“Erin? She was shot?”
Time was—too fast. Too slow. Numbtongue felt like every second was rushing past and taking forever. He heard Palt talking to the air.
“Master Galei. Master Galei. Pick up!”
Montressa jerked around. She heard shouting. Someone had wrenched the door open to Pallass. Drassi. She disappeared through.
“Let me through! Chaldion! Grimalkin! Open the g—”
The [Aegiscaster] finally raised a finger to her own brow. She began shouting.
