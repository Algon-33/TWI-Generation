Mating Rituals Pt.2

That caught Erin’s attention. The young woman stared at the Antinium.
“Wait, there are female Antinium in the Hive? Wait—wait—aren’t those two the Soldiers that Pawn introduced me to?”
Belgrade nodded solemnly.
“Yes. They are female. I believe two pregnancies is not too dangerous, but given the complications of childbirth, we should not risk their deaths…”
“Unless they wish to bear offspring. Perhaps it is worth the risk.”
“Ah, so they say. And it is not that great a risk, yes? These…two Soldiers are female, hm? How did that come about? Or are Antinium different and we cannot tell?”
Beilmark grinned at the three Antinium. And the pieces clicked for Erin.
“Oh. Oh.”
It was just a misunderstanding. Erin put her head down and sighed. But then someone spoke up.
“Hey lads. You know you can buy sex?”
Relc leaned on his spear, grinning widely. Belgrade, Anand, and Yellow Splatters stared at him. Garry poked his head out of the kitchen.
“What? But I was informed it was illegal to solicit sexual intercourse.”
“Oh, on the streets, yeah. But why not visit a brothel?”
Relc looked around. Beilmark was falling off her chair, her chest heaving with mirth. Erin stood up. Anand was opening and closing his mandibles.
“So it is legal? I was under the impression it was not.”
The Senior Guardsman shrugged.
“Liscor’s strict about it. And so’re most Drake cities, but I bet Pallass has some regulated brothels. Very regulated, but it happens. Gnolls are different. They’re the ones who don’t like selling sex; but Drakes allow it, so long as it’s managed.”
“Relc! How do you know that?”
Erin strode over to him, finger pointing. Relc gave Erin a puzzled look.
“I’m a Senior Guardsman. Plus, I patrol there. What’s the harm?”
“Oh. I mean—don’t tell them that! Look!”
The Antinium were electrified. Belgrade huddled with Anand and Yellow Splatters and Garry who came out of the kitchen. He looked at Relc.
“We have funds. Will we be able to purchase this sex?”
“Um. Yeah. Why? How much do you have?”
“Fifty six gold pieces, eleven silver, and thirty two copper pieces.”
Garry announced instantly. The room paused. Relc blinked a few times.
“Uh—yeah. I don’t think you’ll need—even a gold piece for some of the best is like—well, you could get an hour from Liscor’s best for one gold. Most’ll be a handful of silver…they have more money than I have! Klb’s holding out on us!”
He looked at Beilmark. Belgrade seemed shocked.
“These are very generous rates, especially if offspring will be produced from the act. A bargain.”
Relc choked on his spit.
“That…never happens, Belgrade, buddy. It’s a bad thing, uh, if it happens when you don’t want it.”
“What if we would like it to be so? Could we pay for this?”
Belgrade looked at Relc. It was Erin who answered. And she was getting angry.
“It’s more than you think. And I’m afraid you can’t do it easily, Belgrade. It’s not a light thing. And you shouldn’t encourage them, Relc! It can’t happen!”
She rounded on Relc. And she was angry now. This was going too far. Relc held up his claws.
“Hold up. They can get laid, Erin. I bet you some of the girls would go for it, especially in Liscor just to say they did. Especially the big dude, Yellow Splatters.”
“What if we lack genitalia?”
Crash. Ishkr had just walked into a wall. Belgrade looked around innocently.
“Did I not say? We considered this might be an issue.”
“You lack…”
“Yes. See?”
Anand pulled back his loincloth. Erin recoiled—but there was nothing there. Just smooth chitin.
Everyone in the room looked at the Antinium. Relc’s jaw dropped. Then his spear dropped.
“Oh Ancestors. You poor guys.”
