“It is decided. The Hives will prepare. Workers must be sent. All five Hives will dig the tunnel as far as possible. Prepare your Soldiers. Free Queen of the Antinium. Klbkchhezeim.”
Both looked up. The Grand Queen looked at them.
“Prepare the Hive of Liscor for war.”
She vanished from the mirror. The Silent Queen was next.
“Wait, Klbkchhezeim, Free Queen. We will meet for the first time in years.”
The Armored Queen spoke briskly. Tersk was already giving orders.
“All must be done as the Grand Queen wills. My Soldiers will greet yours soon.”
The Flying Queen rubbed her feelers together, almost giddy.
“At last! Battle! War! A grand trick to play on the Humans and Drakes alike. My Hive readies itself. Prepare yours too!”
And then only the Twisted Queen was left. She looked at Klbkch, at the Free Queen and she spoke.
“It is done. Klbkch. Hezeim. Wrymvr sends. His greetings.”
Then she was gone. Klbkch stared into the mirror. He and the Grand Queen looked at each other. Neither spoke for a long moment. Then the Free Queen spoke.
“Klbkchhezeim.”
“Yes, my Queen.”
“You are a Senior Guardsman of Liscor, are you not? I know little of your titles. Of your life above. I have seen through your gaze but I do not understand. When you speak of your time above I am jealous. You have met others whom you speak highly of above. ‘Friends’.”
Klbkch lowered his head.
“I have, my Queen.”
“Could you slay them? Could you let them die? For the plan?”
The Free Queen stared at Klbkch. For a long moment the Revalantor of the Free Antinium stared at the ground. And then he looked up. His voice was cold as he opened his mandibles.
“If you ask it of me my Queen, it will be done. Simply give me the order and I will take Liscor for you.”
“Ah, Klbkch. But would it pain you?”
Klbkch tapped his chest with one finger. The sound was dull. He placed his hands on his sword and bowed.
“I am Klbkchhezeim of the Centenium before I am anything else. For the Hives, I would do anything.”
It was the answer the Free Queen sought. She nodded and turned away. Her voice grew distant as she rose.
“If it must be, Klbkchhezeim, we will take Liscor as required by the Grand Queen. Even if that means the complete eradication of Liscor’s populace.”
“Yes, my Queen.”
The two said nothing else. They stood, feeling cold and alien to the city full of warm-blooded people above. Cold. And old. And tired. Then they heard a voice. It did not come from the mirror, or the vessel which had gone limp. It came from behind them. A weak, warbling voice.
“Who were they?”
Klbkch whirled. The Free Queen exclaimed as she pulled herself over.
“Bird.”
The little Worker was trying to sit up. He was not bleeding, but he could barely move. He relaxed as the Queen lifted him with two feelers.
“Ow. I am much ow. I heard voices. Not just in my head.”
“You are alive. Are you well? Do you sense your injuries worsening?”
Bird thought about that.
“It hurts.”
“Yes.”
The Grand Queen bent over him. Her mandibles opened and closed and Klbkch sensed her anger, previously dormant, resurfacing.
“I will kill the one who did this, Bird.”
“Oh. That is good. I am not happy with them either. But I am mostly hurt. Where is my bow?”
Bird tried to look around and then flinched. Klbkch looked around. The bow was missing. The Queen fussed over Bird.
“Hold still. You are hurt. You must not move.”
“It hurts. It hurts muchly.”
“Yes. But you will live. You will stay here, Bird. You will stay and be well.”
“I am hurt. I am sad. Bad things happened to me. And to Miss Erin’s inn.”
“She—”
