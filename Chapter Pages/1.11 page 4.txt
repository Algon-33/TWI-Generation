“But he’s—”
“I don’t care! You don’t kill people just because they practice stupid magic! And you don’t kill people just because you don’t like them! And you don’t kill people because killing people is wrong!”
“What?”
Relc pointed down at Pisces angrily.
“He’s a criminal.”
“No, he’s an idiot. But he didn’t do anything wrong enough to die for. All he did was try to scare me.”
“He hit me with lightning!”
“You punched his brains out! That’s not enough to kill him over!”
The Drake lowered his spear.
“I can’t believe this. Are you defending him? Because he’s Human? Or do you not want the blood in here? In that case I’ll take him out back and—”
“No!”
Erin shouted at Relc.
“Are you stupid? I don’t want anyone killing anyone! You can’t do it! I forbid it! It’s wrong! It’s illegal.”
“In point of fact, my comrade’s actions are not—”
Erin whirled and pointed at Klbkch.
“I don’t care! No killing, do you hear me?”
Relc hissed angrily.
“Then I’ll arrest him and he’ll be executed tomorrow. Happy?”
Pisces turned pale again. Erin’s mouth replied before her brain caught up.
“I withdraw my testimony.”
“You what?”
“I withdraw it. All of it. I was never attacked yesterday. This mage-guy never visited the inn, and I never saw him until today. So there’s no reason for you to arrest him.”
“You can’t do that!”
Relc turned and looked at Klbkch.
“Can she?”
The ant man nodded reluctantly.
“She is correct. Without her testimony we cannot arrest him.”
Relc faltered. He looked uncertainty at Pisces and then remembered.
“But he’s still a [Necromancer]! That’s a crime no matter what he does!”
Erin crossed her arms.
“Prove it.”
“What?”
“Prove. It. Can you? Is there a way to check his uh, class?”
Relc gritted his teeth.
“…No. Not without an artifact.”
“Then go. Now.”
Relc gaped at Erin. It was surprisingly frightening. Erin could look right down his throat. He had a lot of teeth.
“Are you serious?”
“Absolutely.”
Erin glared at him. Relc lowered his spear, grabbed at the spines on his head and hissed. He pointed at Pisces.
“You take one step in the city and I’ll—I’ll—you take one step in there, and I’ll do something about it.”
Pisces was still lying on the ground. He raised one hand weakly.
“I assure you—”
Relc’s eye twitched.
“Shut up.”
He stomped towards the door.
“Humans!”
Relc kicked the door as he left. Erin winced as she heard the wood crack. Then he was gone.
Klbkch walked past Erin and nodded to her politely.
“Do not mind him. You are within your rights to enforce law within this establishment as you choose. I apologize for the mess on both our behalves.”
He left. Erin stood around the room, looking at the broken chairs, overturned tables, and general wooden carnage. Behind her Pisces got to his feet. He was still shaking and sweatily pale.
“I don’t know how I can thank you good m—Ms. Erin. Please, accept my humblest—”
Bonk.
Erin tapped him on the head with the pot. Hard.
“Out.”
“What?”
Pisces stared at her in disbelief. Erin raised the pot higher.
“Out.”
He stumbled out. Erin kept staring at the mess in the room. It had to be said. Definitely.
“Males.”
