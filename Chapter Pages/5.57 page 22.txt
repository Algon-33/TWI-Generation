“The Goblin Lord is coming. Humans are forcing him to attack Liscor. A big war is coming. Dangerous. For Drakes, for Gnolls…for Humans too.”
“That’s about it. How do you know about what’s going on?”
Erin was impressed. Numbtongue didn’t look that surprised by what was happening. He tapped one ear.
“People talk in the inn all the time. No one pays attention to listening Goblins. Even big Hobs.”
“Huh. Okay. So…what is your tribe going to do?”
“If they let the others go—”
“They will.”
“—then we will go south. No point staying here. It would be a pointless-death. Against Humans. Against the Goblin Lord.”
Erin glanced sideways at Numbtongue.
“You wouldn’t join up with him?”
He bared his teeth.
“No. He is our tribe’s enemy.”
“But you don’t know where your tribe is.”
Numbtongue hesitated. He bowed his head.
“No. Don’t even know if Chieftain is alive. I think she is. But I don’t know.”
Erin was tempted to ask who his Chieftain was. She’d never gotten a chance to talk. In fact, this was the most Numbtongue had ever said to her without being coaxed. She thought about what he’d said.
“Okay. So you’re going south.”
“Yes. We’ll take Cave Goblins south. Go west, towards High Passes. That is home. Maybe our tribe went back. Maybe—we know how to live there.”
“That’s a long way away.”
“Yes.”
Numbtongue looked towards Liscor, and then past it. He looked at Erin.
“Liscor will let my brothers go?”
Erin smiled.
“If they don’t, you’ll stay here. And that would be bad for them. They think you might join the Goblin Lord. So yeah, they’ll let Headscratcher and the others go.”
“Good.”
Numbtongue nodded a few times. Then he hesitated. He looked at Erin.
“The Human army is coming. The Goblin Lord is coming. They’ll kill a city and start a war. Will you stay? Will you run? We can protect you.”
The question caught Erin off-guard. She hesitated.
“I—I’m not going. Not yet.  But I don’t want to leave you guys. I was thinking—I’ll send a magic doorway with you. How about that? That way, you can stay at my inn.”
“You’d do that?”
“Of course. I heard how you protected my inn. And got the door back. Thank you for that.”
Erin smiled at Numbtongue. The Hobgoblin looked abashed. He waved a claw.
“We saw the door. Saw Humans—[Rogues]. Ambushed them. It wasn’t a fair fight.”
“Well, that’s the best kind of fight. And I was in jail the entire time. It’s not actually that bad in there. But I got out early because you showed up.”
“Sorry?”
Erin laughed. Numbtongue smiled, and for a second the two sat together. Erin had so many things she wanted to say, or ask, or do. But she thought of the adventurers marching north and knew she couldn’t. Regretfully, she stood up.
“They’ll let the other guys go now. Zevara says she’ll do it as a sign of goodwill—but if you’re not gone by night, she’ll start bombarding you with spells. So…I guess that’s sorta nice. For her.”
“For her. We’ll leave as soon as I see the others.”
Numbtongue agreed. He stood up with Erin and looked towards Liscor. She saw movement on the battlements and waved her hands. That meant ‘yes’, or so she’d agreed with Zevara. Numbtongue stood beside her. He hesitated.
“Is it a good idea? Going away? We—I feel like it’s running away.”
Erin frowned. She looked at Numbtongue.
“But this isn’t your battle. It’s a silly Human thing. And a Drake thing, I guess. The Goblin Lord’s a Goblin, yeah, but he’s not your problem.”
For a long time the Hobgoblin hesitated. He looked at Erin. He opened and closed his mouth and then whispered hoarsely.
“Yes, but you’re—”
He didn’t get to finish. Erin jumped up excitedly.
