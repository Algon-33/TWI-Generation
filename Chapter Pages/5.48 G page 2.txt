“Yes, Chieftain.”
Pyrite moved away, signaling some of the most exhausted Hobs to take a break. Then he jogged back.
“So. Kind Human.”
“Yes. Gave name. And helped learn magic.”
“Really?”
Pyrite looked very interested. He peered up at Rags. She nodded absently, remembering.
“Not her. Pisces. She—taught me chess. Became [Tactician]. Gave me food.”
“Hm.”
The Hob grunted with clear interest. Rags stared ahead. Oh yes. How simpler it had seemed then. She’d liked Erin. And hated her too, sometimes. For being too nice, too naïve. As if making friends would bring back the dead. But she missed Erin now.
And now—Rags’ head snapped to one side as she saw a ripple in her tribe. The jogging Goblins parted and she saw something that made her heart lurch. A fallen Hob. He’d tripped and was too exhausted to get up. He lay on the ground, panting. Pyrite pointed at him.
“Get to wagon! Keep moving!”
“No.”
Rags leapt from the back of her Carn Wolf. She ran over. The Goblins parted for her and Rags saw that many stumbled as they moved. They were more tired than she’d thought. The Hob looked up.
“Chieftain. Leave behind.”
He was breathing hard and his bare chest was covered in sweat. He was a fat Hob, like Pyrite, but younger. It wasn’t hard to see why he’d collapsed. Pyrite and several Hobs came over. They wanted to lift the Hob, but Rags waved them back. She knelt, thinking hard.
They couldn’t keep on like this. This Hob was the first, but the wagons were already overloaded. Even with the horses they’d acquired, the Goblins were hitting a wall. But what else could she do? She had the bag of holding, but Noears had told her that it could not hold living beings. Or if it did, the people inside would quickly become not living.
All the Goblins had stopped. They watched as Rags knelt by the Hob. They were waiting for her to have a good idea, Rags knew. Only, she didn’t have a way to beat sheer exhaustion. She didn’t have a plan.
But she was a Chieftain. And maybe that was enough. No, it had to be enough.
Rags looked around. The Hob was lying on his back, resigned, unable to move. He wasn’t prepared for Rags to leap onto his broad stomach. He grunted and then looked up. Rags was standing on his gut. She looked around at the Goblins. Tired faces stared back.
“Why are you tired?”
The Goblins looked at each other as Rags shouted. They scratched their heads. The answer was obvious. Rags pointed behind them.
“Humans chase us for five days! Only five days! Not even throwing fireballs anymore! Why is hard to run?”
She leapt from the Hob’s stomach and landed on the ground. Rags looked around and then slapped her chest.
“Follow me! Is not hard!”
She took a few steps forwards and turned. The Hob lying on the ground stared at her. She gestured at him.
“Up! Why is Hob with big legs slower than small Chieftain?”
“Tired. Carry lots of things.”
He grunted at Rags, almost indignantly. Rags sneered at him.
“Big Hob can’t even walk another step? Can’t even stand?”
The fat Hob glared at Rags. He shifted and sat up as if to prove her wrong. He pointed at his back.
“Chieftain not carry club.”
Rags saw the Hob had strapped a huge club to his back. It was a monster of a weapon, the kind you’d use to hunt bears or [Knights] in full armor. It had to weigh a ton. But Rags just sneered. She struck a pose and pointed to her shortsword hanging at her side.
“That because Chieftain smart. Uses sword. Sharp. Better than wooden club. Only good for firewood.”
The Hob huffed as the other Goblins laughed.
“Not if fight Gargoyle.”
“You fight Gargoyle?”
Rags paused. The Hob nodded proudly.
