They’d been healed. But a little Gnoll child stared at the shining mirror Teres held. She had one eye. The other was missing. She looked so young, to Rufelt. A Plains Gnoll. Just like—
She was missing an eye. And the bodies of the Gnoll tribe—
“Ruf? It’s gone quiet. What’s—”
In Scales and Tails, Rufelt heard a crash as Lasica dropped the plates she’d been carrying out of the kitchen. The audience of Pallass’ citizens stared. The world stared.
Noass’ voice shook.
“Even the children—what happened?”
Flos stared into the mirror. Then he turned.
“For what reason did this occur? Because they were thieves? Because they quarreled, or broke any law? Orthenon, bring forwards the one who ordered this.”
A man was dragged into the frame. He was knelt by Orthenon and Mars. The [Headman] was pale, shaking. He spat at Flos’ feet.
“King of Destruction. May you—”
Orthenon struck the man with the butt of his spear. Silence. Flos stared down at him.
“Did your village kill these Gnolls?”
Silence. The man spat more blood. Flos leaned down.
“Answer me.”
This time the force of his question was like a physical thing. Even Noass flinched. The [Headman] looked up, unwillingly.
“Yes. We killed them.”
“Why? What crimes did they commit?”
“They st—”
The lie caught on the man’s tongue. Flos Reimarch waited.
Silence.
“What did they do? Nothing? Then why did they die? This tribe came for me. What did they do to deserve death? Tell me.”
“They were yours!”
The man spat. He spat at Flos’ face. Blood spattered the [King]’s skin. He wiped away the blood as Mars drove the man’s face into the ground. The [Headman] kept speaking.
“They were yours! The beasts! You have enemies everywhere, King of Destruction! They never reached you! This is your fault!”
Mars began to press, but Flos raised a hand. He paused and his eyes found the mirror, then the kneeling man.
“Yes. Because they were my subjects. No reason beyond that. And they were not the first, were they? How many were waylaid within Belchan?”
This time his question went to the [Commander]. The man was kneeling. Zamea pushed him forwards. His face was dead-white.
“I had no knowledge of this, King Reimarch. None at all!”
“But it happened within Belchan. You had to know they entered your borders. But they never left. Your Prime Minister, didn’t he give them escorts? Track them? What were his orders?”
The [Commander]’s lips moved helplessly.
“We—didn’t escort them. Your Majesty. But—we did not know. Please—”
Flos spoke, swinging around. Still…waiting.
“They were given no escort. And no one thought to even ask about their deaths. Though you knew that my subjects had been attacked. You knew.”
He looked at the man. And there was no response. Flos Reimarch looked around. Noass didn’t say a word. He might have forgotten he was even being broadcast.
“Children to be sold as slaves. The rest cut down here. Because they came for me. They left their homes and came all this way. And died. Calling out my name. And Belchan’s ruler welcomed me into his lands with a smile. I rode, searching for them. And they were dead before I knew to look.”
He said nothing after that. Just stood, amid it all. Rufelt felt Lasica holding him. He wanted to turn the mirror off. But the King of Destruction just stood there. Then he turned his head.
“Orthenon.”
The [Steward] moved. He needed no other order. He walked past the [Headman]. Orthenon drew his sword and placed it in the King of Destruction’s hand. The King of Destruction walked over to the [Headman]. The man looked up, cursing and struggling in Mars’ grasp.
“We—”
