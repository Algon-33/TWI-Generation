At some point Erin slept. At some point Erin woke up. These were minor details. What mattered was the sound.
Knock. Knock.
She tried hard to ignore it. But it kept going and going, waking her up from her peaceful oblivion.
After a while, the knocking was too hard to ignore. Erin opened her eyes and sat up. It was far too bright in the world. And noisy.
Someone was knocking at the door. Erin thought about going back to sleep, but the knocking hadn’t ceased for the last few minutes. So she reluctantly got up and opened the door.
“What do you want?”
Pisces the friendly mage gave her a brilliant smile.
“Greetings Good Mistress. I was wondering if I could impose upon you—”
Erin shut the door. After a few seconds she opened it.
“Less words. Get to the point.”
“Um. Very well. Are you open today?”
Erin looked around.
“Who?”
“You. This establishment.”
“Here?”
Pisces blinked a few times. He spoke very carefully.
“Is this place open? Do you provide sustenan—food? I pay, I eat?”
Erin glared at him.
“It’s early. Yes, I guess I am open. Come in.”
She stomped inside. After a moment Pisces followed.
“I would like to peruse your menu if I m—”
Erin tossed a plate on the table and left. She came back with four blue fruits and tossed them on the table too. Pisces stared at the fruit and opened his mouth. He looked at Erin’s expression and amended whatever he was going to say.
“If I might trouble you for a knife and fork—”
She slapped them down on the table and walked away. She would have liked to go back to sleep, but the sounds of Pisces shifting and the clink of silverware on pottery was too distracting. Instead, she got her own blue fruit and started a fire to warm up her pasta. She munched on the sweet fruit in dour silence.
Outside, it began to rain.
