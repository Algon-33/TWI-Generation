She protested. One of the Gnolls snorted.
“Longstalker’s? That’s some tale. They’re good, traditionalists. Not like the mavericks.”
He cast a glance at the Silverfang tribe and shook his head. Inkar didn’t see what was wrong with this game, but the Gnoll clearly did.
“If you are, the Chieftain will find out! Come with us!”
His grip tightened. Inkar yelped.
“Ow! Stop!”
“Here now. At least escort her without tearing her arm off.”
Merrik, the Dwarf, scratched at his beard. The Gnoll from the Decles tribe snarled at him.
“Back off, outsider! This is tribe business and this Human broke our laws!”
Merrik frowned, but the Minotaur put a hand on his shoulder.
“Tribal business, Merrik. We respect the laws or Feshi would have our horns.”
“Pah.”
Inkar wasn’t resisting. She marched with the Gnolls, reluctant to cause an incident—and besides, Eska could sort it out. It was uncomfortable, but she was moving with the Gnolls right until a Gnoll ran into the four, panting.
Oor. Late by a minute. The panting Gnoll had run everywhere, trying to track Inkar’s scent through the Meeting of Tribes. He would have arrived sooner if he hadn’t lost it at the checkpoint.
“Wait! She’s with us! Longstalker’s tribe! My Chieftain sent me to go with her!”
He gasped. The three Gnolls halted. One eyed Orr.
“We’re Decles tribe. This Human was in the inner camp—”
“Yes! Yes, she’s with our tribe! Sorry—she’s with us.”
Orr! Inkar sagged with relief. But the three Gnolls didn’t seem happy with that. One eyed Orr suspiciously.
“You might not be Longstalkers. You could be a random Gnoll. And why would the Chieftain of the Longstalkers make such a foolish mistake?”
Orr bristled at that. So did Inkar.
“Chieftain Eska has her reasons. And both Ekhtouch and Greenpaw know a human is with us!”
The Gnolls snorted at ‘Greenpaw’, but frowned at Ekhtouch. They looked at each other uncertainly, but their leader bared his teeth.
“Fine. Then our Chieftain will investigate both matters! Come on.”
He tugged Inkar and she yelped. She was willing to go with them, but did they have to drag her? Oor frowned.
“That’s not necessary. We’ll go to Longstalker’s first if we have to. Let Inkarr—Honored Inkar go.”
The Gnolls around looked up. The Decles Gnolls gawked.
“You must be mad. Honored…? This is a bad ruse. You’re both coming with us.”
Oor reached for Inkar.
“I don’t think so. If you want to ask—ask Longstalker’s or Ekhtouch! Inkarr, I’m sorry. Let’s—”
“Don’t.”
The other Gnoll pushed Oor back. The [Warrior] stumbled—and then his eyes narrowed. He looked at the three. They glared back, fur rising. Inkar tried to say something.
“Oor, it’s fine. We’ll sort it out. Peacefully.”
“I’m not going to let them drag you to another tribe’s camp like a criminal, Inkarr. I am Longstalker’s warrior! Let her go!”
The other Gnolls shook their heads. One growled.
“Decles doesn’t answer to Longstalkers. Follow us if you want to, but we’re taking her—”
He yanked Inkar and she stumbled. That was the last straw. Oor went for him. Which, in the annals of combat decisions wasn’t the most intelligent.
There were three of them and one of him.

Tkrn was busy showing the other Gnolls proper form for swinging. He didn’t notice the fight and commotion at first. Then he heard a shout.
“Stop! Stop it!”
He looked up. So did other Silverfangs and Gnolls. One called out.
“What’s that?”
“Fight. Two other tribes. Don’t worry; Plain’s Eye or Az’muzarre or a Chieftain will sort it out.”
