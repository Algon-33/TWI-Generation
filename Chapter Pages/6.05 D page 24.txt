“It’s a vote of confidence. Who else is going out and actually taking on monsters? Us. And the Swedes.”
He nodded at Siri and Tofte. The Norwegian man looked up.
“Some want to. But not when they know what it’s like.”
The others nodded. Once you’d actually come face-to-face with a monster—even a zombie, you learned how real it was. Hell, even a zombie…Daly remembered having to slowly hack at the zombie’s head, just to bring it down. And the smell, the feel of metal hitting bone…
In the silence, Daly looked around.
“We’re not all experts who live out in the bush. That’s true enough. But someone’s got to do this job. Push comes to shove, we’re our company’s first response.”
“And we volunteered. We didn’t have to.”
Daly nodded he glanced at Dawson.
“Anyone tells you how we should wander off and kill a Spear Spider with a boomerang, you just tell them we’re not used to this. If they want to join up, they can. But it’s not a fun job. I’m proud of you all for stepping up.”
There was a moment of silence. Then Dawson offered a tired smile.
“Love you too, Daly. No homo.”
“Aw, you idiot…”
The group broke up. Daly sighed as they trooped up the stairs—to share a room this time. He stayed up, wondering if he could nap in the living room or if the ants would start crawling in his ears.
Eventually Kirana finished her work and turned out the light in the kitchen. She headed upstairs, missing Daly. He was sitting so still he was invisible. And he had a Skill.
[Faint Presence]. An [Axe Warrior], a [Carpenter], and a [Rogue]. Apparently he might become a [Ranger] if he kept at it. Daly sighed. And then he heard a faint sound.
Someone was coming down the stairs. Daly looked up, about to call out. And then he saw Blake. Daly froze. His hand reached for his side. And then he reconsidered. He reached for something else instead. Blake walked down the stairs, barely making a sound. Quiet, slowly. He looked around the room, and then crept for the door.
“Going somewhere?”
Blake spun. He saw Daly, sitting in the shadows, one hand resting on the table. The other was on his lap. Daly pointed.
“I’m not the suspicious sort. But we had one incident where a bloke tried to rob us and then do a runner.”
“I wasn’t. I was just—I needed to step outside. Be alone.”
Blake gulped. Daly eyed him, then shook his head.
“Outside? You’ll just run into Lizardfolk. And there’s no alone when you’re with even one of them. Have a seat. Here’s the best you’ll get, probably.”
He pulled up a chair. Blake hesitated, and then sat across from him. He stared at Daly.
“I wasn’t going to take anything.”
“I believe you. What’s wrong. Can’t sleep?”
“No. It’s—I did sleep, but then I woke up. I couldn’t get back. All of this—it’s too much to believe.”
The New Zealander uttered a short laugh. It was more like a bark of sound. Daly nodded.
“It’s tough. But believe me, it’s real. If pinching could wake me up—it’s all real.”
“I know. There’s no way I’m dreaming. But I want to be. You know?”
Blake ran a hand through his hair. He felt silent. Daly waited.
“About when we came here. What I said—we got jumped on the first day, you know? Not by bandits or—[Bandits]. By other people. From home.”
“Really?”
Daly didn’t move. Blake looked up.
“Yeah. I don’t know who they were. They just came out of nowhere. This guy ran up—they’d smelled us cooking that fish. They told us to hand it over. One of the Italians said no. They started shoving each other and then—they just attacked us.”
“What nationality were they?”
The other young man looked up. Daly elaborated.
