It was all Rags could think of. Ulvama sighed, but didn’t argue. Rags was Chieftain, and strangely, none of Tremborag’s Goblins questioned it. Pyrite muttered something and both female Goblins looked at him.
“What you say?”
“Chieftain, what happens when get there? Fight Reiss? Run?”
“Don’t know. Just keep walking.”
Pyrite grunted. Ulvama looked scornfully at the huge Hob.
“Pyrite is slow. Could go faster without him.”
She seemed to be holding a grudge. Rags poked her in the side and Ulvama yelped. The little Goblin glared.
“Going fast enough. Pyrite weak.”
“Can he fight?”
The [Shaman] looked challengingly at Pyrite. The other warriors marching behind them looked at each other. The Hob who’d been entrusted with Pyrite’s axe shook his head. They didn’t question whether Pyrite could fight. He’d cut down so many of Reiss’ warriors that they’d been too afraid to even loot his body.
For his part, Pyrite just looked at Ulvama and shrugged, though it cost him to do so.
“Am tired. When fighting starts, I will have energy.”
That was all. Ulvama nodded reluctantly. She cast her eye to the sky and the bright, spring day. It didn’t feel like a day for war. She raised her fingers and pointed.
“[Sky’s Blessing].”
Rags looked up as Ulvama’s fingers and skin paint glowed. Suddenly, the air felt fresh and invigorating, and it felt like she was marching with the wind at her back. She stared at Ulvama, and then at Pyrite. The [Shaman] looked away from both of them.
“March faster, stupid Hob.”
Pyrite smiled. So did Rags. The Goblins walked on. Rags tried not to think about what would happen when they got to Liscor. She told herself she’d deal with it when it came, but the truth was she was too late. Reiss had won. Whatever would happen would happen without her there. And she feared the worst.
To take her mind off of that, she looked at Pyrite. At Ulvama. They were both Tremborag’s Goblins, at least, they had been at one time or another. She looked at Pyrite.
“When did you leave Tremborag mountain?”
He blinked. For a second she thought he’d avoid the question, like he sometimes did, but the big Goblin just sighed. The time for secrets had long since passed. Now he just looked embarrassed and tired.
“Long time ago. Very young Goblin. I was…five? Had a fight with Greybeard. Greydath. Decided to leave. Start my own tribe. Become strong. Become Goblin Lord.”
The other Goblins gaped at him. Pyrite shrugged, flushing a bit.
“Stupid. Young and stupid. Thought it would be easy. So I made tribe. Made big tribe.”
“Goldstone Tribe?”
Rags was confused. Pyrite shook his head.
“No. Other tribe. Called it—uh—Mountain Fierce Warriors Tribe.”
He looked ashamed. Rags stared at him and Ulvama sniggered. Pyrite scratched at the back of his head.
“Didn’t work well.”
“Why?”
He shrugged again.
“Had Hobs. Trained warriors. Had thousands of regular Goblins. But—stood out. Picked too many fights. Humans came. Destroyed tribe. Nearly died. Learned…learned Chieftain is not as good as Goblin Lord. Not nearly. So gave up. Became wanderer. Formed other tribe eventually.”
“But didn’t try to become Lord?”
“No. Not again.”
Pyrite shook his head heavily. He looked at Rags.
“Too much. Greydath—Reiss—Lords are too much.”
Overwhelming. Rags remembered what Greydath had said. Reiss had beaten Pyrite, even though he was a [Mage]. And Greydath—she nodded soberly.
“Much. But good to try.”
She heard a snort from Ulvama. The [Shaman] glared at her.
“Don’t need Goblin Lords! Why do stupid Goblin Lords and males fight all the time? Garen, Reiss, Greydath—stupid! Should just live in tribe.”
