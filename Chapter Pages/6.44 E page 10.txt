The others looked at him. The [Summer Knight] was bent as Ryoka approached with Prost, Rie, the others. Prost called out and the group turned. Ryoka saw the [Knight] turn to face them and froze.
His armor blazed with the colors of his season. Gold and red and orange. His sword still burned. But the man was different. He had been changed.
“Who are you people?”
Prost demanded. The [Witch Hunters] looked at him. One nodded.
“We are members of the Hunter’s Guild.”
“The what?”
“Terandria.”
Lady Rie murmured the words. Her eyes were wide. The other [Hunters] nodded. One went to Raim’s side. He was bent over. Another ran for the orb on the ground. Ran, not walked. The woman with the bow had turned, scanning the distance. The one with the crossbows spoke tersely.
“We are hunting the Stitch Witch, Belavierr. Your pardons, but she is a wanted criminal.”
“We know. That is—her coven—”
The [Hunter] looked up. He lifted one crossbow as seven [Witches] approached.
“We have no quarrel with you. But we will not be stopped so close to our goal. [Witches], hold. And you. Are you the [Village Head] here?”
“No. [Steward] to Emperor Godart.”
The [Hunter] paused. But then his head turned, his eyes flicked to the horizon. And Ryoka felt it too. Then she saw movement.
“Tagil—”
“I see it. Whoever you are, all of you, get your people into that village. We’ll cover you. The Stitch Witch is hurt. But she’s desperate. And she knows we can find her.”
“Raim!”
The [Huntress] archer called out nervously. The [Knight] was moving towards them, supported by the man with the hammer. The [Summer Knight]’s voice was beyond weary.
“The Order. We have her. I can finish her. I cut away her immortality. But—”
“We see it.”
The scrying orb was speaking. Ryoka saw a huge conference table, staring faces. [Knights], gathered in the circular reflection. Ser Raim nodded. Then he pointed. Prost, Rie, Ryoka, all looked up.
“She can die. But she has sent her minions against us. We must track her down.”
“Protect Sylind. If she dies, Belavierr escapes.”
The [Hunter] drew his crossbows and shot. Ryoka didn’t see what he aimed at first. Then, as both crossbows reloaded and she shot again, she saw them.
A legion of warriors made of cloth. Not one or a thousand, but tens of thousands. Taxidermy monsters, indistinguishable from their real counterparts. A patchwork giant, as misshapen as a Snow Golem, lurching forwards. And then—Ryoka’s heart stopped.
A Dragon, crawling towards them. But the scales were purple cloth. The creature fake. But the threat real. And in the sky came howling faces. Half-real things that flickered and made Ryoka want to tear at her ears. The others paled, but the [Hunters] set themselves.
“Looks like bound wraiths. An entire army of cloth monsters. Brace.”
The crossbows shot. Ser Raim gasped for air. He turned. And Ryoka saw that he had burnt himself away. But the ember flickered. Belavierr’s death coughed. Then he straightened.
“Knight-Commander. A word.”
