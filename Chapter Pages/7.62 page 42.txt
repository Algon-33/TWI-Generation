“Will you allow this? Have you no honor left? I seek no mercy from the Spider. But have you no soul?”
“You are the embodiment of my enemy.”
Az’kerash paused. Maviola El looked at him. Then she closed her eyes.
“Then begone, monster. Spider—do your worst. I will not break.”
“You will. You do not know anguish.”
Belavierr’s eyes glowed. It was the only light in the room. Maviola lay, panting. The [Witch] reached for her.
“When you give me your all—I promise you one thing.”
“That I will suffer? I w—”
“No. When you give me your all. You will be smiling.”
The Witch laughed. It was an unpracticed sound. Maviola saw her raise a hand—
Az’kerash walked forwards. He raised a wand.
“[Deathbolt].”
He pointed it at Maviola’s chest. The [Lady] convulsed as the black magic struck her. The Necromancer spoke.
“[Deathbolt]. [Deathbolt]. [Deathbolt].”
The [Lady] died. Toren saw the life go out of her. He felt a pang in his chest. And somehow—relief.
Maviola died there, a smile of surprise on her lips.
Belavierr stared at Maviola’s face in shock. Then she whirled.
“You killed her. Why?”
Her hands were grasping. Az’kerash looked at Belavierr.
“You have your vessel, Belavierr the Witch. We will cooperate. Until my Chosen are done. And your servants. Then—you will leave this place. And you will not return.”
“Why have you changed your mind?”
She tilted her head, confused. Az’kerash looked at what had been Maviola El.
“A brave woman’s words. My Chosen, my children, do not need your lessons. Only your magic.”
“One is the same as the other.”
“Perhaps. My words stand.”
The Necromancer looked away. Toren shrank as Belavierr stood there. Was it rage he sensed? Confusion? Her expression was blank. Her eyes flickered.
“I remember now.”
The second time, Az’kerash stopped on his way out of the room. He turned back. Belavierr produced a needle and thread. She bent over the body.
“Remember what?”
The Stitch Witch began to sew.
“They called me evil. I remember. The Witch of Calamity. The Temptress. Spider. So many names for me. Sometimes they called me good. The String Folk did. Then they called me evil. I wondered how to be…evil.”
She looked up, holding Peril Chandler’s gaze.
“I have only ever done as I desired. I have always stayed true to myself. So that is evil.”
He looked at her, the Necromancer and the Witch. Looking at each other directly. And somehow—never seeing each other eye-to-eye. Then one left.
The dark castle lay still.
Time passed. The worst had happened. And the worst still—the Stitch Witch smiled, unpracticed.
Then the Summer Solstice began.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: A second chapter. It wasn’t as good in many parts as I wanted. However. That was the substance of it. I’m going to look it over—but probably publish it.
Volume 7 is ending soon. No art for today.
