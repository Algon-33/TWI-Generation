Solstice (Pt. 9)
Page 1

The world shifted. The hilltop of gentle grass, the stone gateways—changed. Not disappeared. They blended into another form.
A truer form? No. Just a different perspective.
The flowers were swords. And the hilltop was barren.
Just dirt. Dust. A substance that was less than either. A powder of the end of the world.
On the outskirts of the lands of the fae—nothing existed past this place. And each hilltop? A gateway.
This one stood with doors sealed, until you opened it. A vast structure of some metal Ryoka had no knowledge of. And planted on the hill were…swords.
Weapons. Buried in the earth. A warrior’s salute. Broken flags. Armor, hung and torn from the blades the owners had borne.
To war.
How many times? Ryoka’s eyes widened.
Her friend stood there, pale among the starlit sky. A shimmering light like the countless stars beyond. Distant realms amid the blackness.
“You have been in that world before.”
 
“Many times. Once, we came as friend. Later—as warriors. Look.”
 
Ryoka was afraid to. She turned—and the world changed again.
Statues stood in the hallway. The door at the end looked like Erin’s door. Just a simple wooden door, waiting for someone to open it.
But the hallway was vast, so long she would have to run for days without end just to cross it. It was so long because each space was occupied by a statue.
A statue—like the garden. Each one of a fae. 
Some were like Ivolethe. Members of the Court of the Fae. Others? Ryoka saw a true Brownie, whose shape Nama had borrowed. Humble pixies. And proud folk like Silver Pine, as tall as the world itself.
She saw Dragons. Wyrms. She saw so many countless statues, all named. All reverentially treated.
Flowers. Swords. Statues.
“No. No.”
A terrible fear gripped Ryoka as her feet carried her down the hallway. She did not want to see. The last piece of the truth was at the end. Two in one.
A flower.
It was not the tallest. Not the most unique on the hill, even. Ryoka’s feet halted unwillingly in the grass. She had seen it once before. She had wept for it then. And not known why.
Two blooms twined together. Two ideas.
Summer and Winter.
Ryoka saw, across every perspective. It had always been there. And it was written in her tongue. In English. Spanish. French. In all the tongues of Earth. And all the ones she did not know.
Written in a way she could understand it. Writ in every tongue, in every tear.
 
Here lies Maeve. Queen of the Faeries.
Here lies Titania. Queen of the Faeries.
 
Slowly, Ryoka sank to her knees in the grass. The flower bloomed. The twin statues stood. The two swords stood in the dirt.
Ivolethe was weeping. So was Ryoka. There weren’t enough tears, though.
“How? How did it come to this?”
Ryoka turned to Ivolethe. The Winter Fae spoke through her grief. A simple answer.
“We kept our promises.”
That was all. Ryoka collapsed. Ivolethe urged her upwards.
“I have a promise to fulfill, Ryoka.”
But the Wind Runner had no will to ask her. Not one more. Too many. Too many. She looked at Ivolethe.
And the day ended.

Abruptly, Numbtongue wondered what he was doing. He raised his head as the night echoed around him.
Mrsha was asleep in Lyonette’s arms, tears still drying on the [Princess]’ blouse. Everyone was silent around them.
Antinium, staff, Bird—but they were in Timbor’s private room.
Not The Wandering Inn. Why? Why had they not been in the inn on the Summer Solstice?
Numbtongue only asked these questions because Shorthilt and Pyrite did. They had been screaming at him all day and he had not heard.
“Reiss? What happened?”
