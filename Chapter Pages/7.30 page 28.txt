“Don’t be modest. I hate false modesty. You know what you’ve done. All I want to do is give you more power. If I had met you when you were younger—you could have burned Skinner out of existence yourself. I could have, at any rate.”
She smiled, conjuring a little ball of fire in one hand. Erin stared at it.
“…Is that magic? I can’t do magic.”
“No. The power of my aura. I’m fire. I don’t know what you are, but we can find out. Erin. Will you let me teach you?”
The [Innkeeper] sat there. Then she stood up. She looked at Maviola. Here she was. Someone with Erin’s very Skills. Someone who was a master. Erin looked at Maviola.
“…Sure. But also—do you want to go to a party? Can you make it that long? No, you have to.”
Maviola blinked.
“A party?”
The two began to talk. Animatedly. Arms were waved. But Erin found herself sitting across from…a friend. Odd, but she knew Maviola better than perhaps the [Lady] had intended.
[Like Fire, Memory]. But also—[Immortal Moments]. A Skill Maviola hadn’t accounted for. And that was the thing. The moments might pass. But they were still immortal.

The fire was wondrous. Golden. It blazed like gold in Maviola’s hands. She stood in the [Garden of Sanctuary] and Erin marveled at it. So did Mrsha. The Gnoll girl sat, staring at the two as they stood on the hill. Lyonette and Numbtongue peeked through the door.
“This is my glory. Yours is different. But with time—practice—you can make it stronger. Each one has vast utility. I cannot believe you gained your Skill barely a month ago!”
Maviola’s voice was almost indignant. Erin shrugged helplessly.
“It’s a great Skill. And I did get it at Level 40.”
“Yes, but—with this Skill? What kind of class do you have? Wait. I know this one. [Magical Innkeeper]. I suppose it’s a rare class. Still—I’m a [Lady]. Your Skills match mine.”
Maviola made an unhappy face. Erin rubbed at her head. Maviola’s memories were bouncing around in her skull too.
“It’s weird. But I’m also from…Earth.”
Lyonette slapped her face. Numbtongue copied her. Maviola just nodded.
“What a strange place. But I know it. Together, your flame and mine is too—too intimate. I saw too much thanks to your [Immortal Moments]. Just as well I didn’t conjure a flame with me and Olesm, hm?”
She grinned as Erin turned red. Mrsha rolled down the side of the hill in disgust.
“No thank you. Can you just show me the fire, please?”
“Certainly. Watch.”
Maviola concentrated and the golden flame turned into a ball of fire. She drew her arm back and threw it.
Golden flames arced through the air. Erin yelped.
“No! Don’t set my garden on fire—”
The flames landed, burned. But consumed nothing. Erin stopped. Maviola looked at her.
“Glory burns nothing. It’s fleeting.”
“Your glory doesn’t burn anything. But mine does!”
The [Lady] frowned, crossing her arms in vexation.
“Hm. This is harder than I thought. Our fires are clearly different. But at least—I can show you a few things. You can throw your fire. Also—do this.”
She set herself on fire. White flames burst from her body and Mrsha scrambled backwards. Then she crawled up the hill and tried to touch Maviola.
“No, Mrsha. Don’t. Shoo! Shoo! Go play with the beavers.”
Erin tried to urge Mrsha away. The Gnoll looked up at her. But this was more fun! Maviola smiled.
“Here.”
She offered a bit of the white fire of kindness to Mrsha. The Gnoll gleefully took it and watched as it licked over her paw. Erin protested.
“Hey! That’s—”
“It won’t burn her. See?”
Mrsha tried to wipe the fire onto the grass. It burned very slowly and went out after a few seconds. Maviola looked at Erin.
