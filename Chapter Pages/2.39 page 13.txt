It’s like someone’s sent a jolt of electricity down my spine. My eyes fly open, and my heart begins to beat again. Anger stirs in my chest, a dark, twisting thing.
“What did you just say?”
“I met Lady Magnolia. Look, she sent a carriage to my inn, Ryoka, and I thought—”
“You just got in, didn’t you? Just like that, without a second damn thought?”
“I—”
Erin spreads her hands out helplessly. As if to say ‘what should I have done’? It makes me even angrier. My voice rises, and Mrsha, half-dozing, looks up.
“What did you tell her?”
“Um.”
Erin scratches her head. She can’t even remember.
“Nothing much…? But she knows I’m from our world. I mean, another world. And uh, she’s got other people.”
“Other people from our world?”
Damn her. My heart is beating faster. Erin nods.
“Yeah, she’s got a bunch of girls and guys. They’re younger than us, but they want to become adventurers. But uh, Magnolia doesn’t want them to leave. She’s afraid they’ll tell the secrets of our world.”
“And she knows those secrets? She knows everything?”
Erin can’t meet my eye.
“…Yeah. She knows about guns and stuff.”
“Fuck.”
I hit the table with my good hand. Erin looks worried. She reaches out to me, but I knock her hand away.
“I didn’t tell her anything important, Ryoka! She just wanted to know if I could be trusted. She tried to use a Skill on me, but it didn’t work—”
“You shouldn’t have been near her in the first place!”
I jab at Erin with one finger. She looks indignant.
“Why not? You met her!”
“Before I knew how dangerous she was. But you—you should have thought before you spoke to her! Did you even hesitate? Or did you see a shiny coach and just decide to get in?”
“Ryoka, that’s not what happened. Listen.”
Erin frowns, but I’m done listening. The beast is in my chest, and the fury is consuming my mind. Too late.
“No. You listen. You going to meet Magnolia is exactly what she wanted. She knows you’re from another world now, you idiot! She had no way of telling, but you gave it away—probably the instant she suggested she knew! And now she knows I know you, she’ll use you to get to me!”
“She wouldn’t do—”
Erin hesitates. Even she can’t finish that sentence. I glare at her. Something’s in my chest. It has control of my tongue.
“You don’t think. You just dance to her strings like a damn puppet, you moron.”
The other girl’s brows snap together.
“Don’t say it like that. I didn’t do anything wrong! I think Magnolia’s on our side.”
“On our side?”
Something in me snaps. All of the hatred, the anger, the frustration and fear and loss—it spews out of me, like poison.
“You fucking idiot. Don’t you ever think? No. you don’t. You just go ahead and do whatever’s in your empty head without a second’s regard for the consequences. Because of you, one of the most dangerous people in the world knows your secret and she’ll never give up. This is all your fault, you airheaded brat.”
I can’t stop the torrent. I don’t even want to. Erin stares at me first in shock and hurt, and then outrage.
“I’m not an idiot! Ryoka, just listen—”
“Shut up.”
“No! You shut up and listen!”
“So I can hear more of the lies Magnolia’s put in your head? But you believe what she’s told you without any doubt. Just how stupid are you!?”
I’m going too far. I know it, but I can’t stop. Erin’s face freezes.
“Don’t call me stupid.”
“Why not? You’re the dumbest person I’ve ever met.”
“Ryoka. I’m warning you—”
“Oh? And what will you do?”
“Just don’t call me names! Listen to me for a second!”
“No. Fuck you. You’re an incompetent buffoon.”
I poke Erin in the chest, hard. Too far. Stop. Erin grabs my hand.
