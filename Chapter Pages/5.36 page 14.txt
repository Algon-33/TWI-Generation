“And letting her go? Not just outside, I mean. What if we went to Celum, took her outside the walls, and…let her go there?”
The Redfangs exchanged a glance then shook their heads. Numbtongue explained haltingly.
“Can’t let go. She will go back. Or die. A Goblin alone dies to monsters. To adventurers. It is one of the worst deaths. Slow, lonely death. Wandering death. Cruel death.”
The other Hobs nodded as one. Erin looked at them. So. It was too dangerous to keep her, too risky or cruel to let her go. That was why they would kill her. It was practical, like the Goblins. It was also wrong. She sighed.
“Okay. I see what you were thinking. And I think you’re wrong. Let me explain.”
She reached for a pawn, took Headscratcher’s bishop which she’d cornered, and spoke absently.
“Here’s the problem, I think. You say that Pebblesnatch is the enemy. You say she’s dangerous. If we let her go she’ll turn on us. We can’t keep her. So we need to kill her. And I say—why do we have to do any of that? Why can’t we help her?”
She looked up expectantly. Numbtongue shook his head.
“Help? Her? She is other tribe. Other tribe has many Goblins who will kill—”
He emphasized the word.
“—Us. Why help them? We can’t help them. Too many. Too far away. What point? Why help enemy?”
“Good question.”
Erin rested her chin in her hands. She eyed the board.
“Whenever anyone says something like that—we can’t help them, or they’re the enemy, or how hard it would be, it’s sort of like a game of chess. That’s my analogy. I like chess. We’re all trying to get ahead, to survive. We’re all playing chess, if you think of it like that. So everyone wants to protect themselves, their side. The king. See?”
Erin pointed at her king, safely hidden behind her pawns. Headscratcher and the other Goblins eyed the white king on their side. It was being menaced from all angles by Erin’s pieces. They found that ironically familiar. They nodded and Erin went on.
“That’s how people play. Life, like chess. It’s all about sides. Us. Them. Me. You. But here’s the thing. Life isn’t a game of chess. You say that Pebblesnatch is the enemy, Numbtongue? In that case, you’re playing a game. Your side is the Redfangs, you, and my inn, I guess. And my side would be Pebblesnatch. And the Raskghar.”
The Redfangs stared at Erin’s side of the board. They eyed their disadvantaged position. Erin rolled her eyes.
“It’s a metaphor. It’s not representing how things actually are. Look, it’s your side and her side. That’s how you’re playing. But I don’t think that’s a healthy way to look at things. It’s too limiting. Sometimes I think we should do this.”
Erin spun the chess board. Suddenly, her pieces were in check and Headscratcher’s pieces were on the attack. The Hob blinked. He stared at Pebblesnatch, who’d woken up and was trying to bite at the ropes tying her down. Erin smiled slightly.
“Weird, isn’t it? Now you’re winning. Go on, move a piece.”
She waited as Headscratcher did. Erin continued to play, reversing the board yet again.
“The thing about sides, Headscratcher, you guys, is that they’re made up. Chess is a game. It’s not real. But we pretend the sides are real. Just like we pretend there are sides in real life. What makes the Raskghar our enemy?”
“They’re trying to kill us?”
Ishkr blinked as Erin looked over.
“Right. But are they trying to kill us because they’re hungry? Are they just monsters? If they are, I guess we might have to fight. But what about the Cave Goblins? Are they our enemy? Or are they being made to fight?”
