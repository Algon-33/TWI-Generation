Badarrow stirred. He looked at Rags. She glanced at him.
“Inn important. But…small. Dangerous. Badarrow, goes. Searches for Goblins.”
“Me too.”
“And Snapjaw. But later. And maybe—make Wyverns tame. Going to have to learn how to fly. Maybe make saddles, rope in case fall.”
Rags was already thinking over the logistics, sighing. So much poo. And they’d eat so much. The other Goblins looked at her. Redscar grinned.
“Chieftain going somewhere? Inn?”
The Goblin Chieftain paused. She pursed her lips, and then she shook her head.
“No. Maybe. Going to find other Chieftains first. The two in the north.”
The others looked at her. Rags explained.
“Other Chieftains. Ones who refused to fight Reiss, join Tremborag. Strong.”
Snapjaw nodded slowly. She remembered. So did Redscar.
“The [Witch] and the [Fighter].”
The giant Goblin leader and the Goblin [Witch]. Redscar looked mystified.
“Why? Fight? Say hi and slap back?”
“Allies. To go up. And to find key.”
Rags’ eyes glinted. She couldn’t remember enough. Her tribe was too small. But—she looked at the key Garen had left everything for. So did Redscar, Badarrow. Snapjaw glanced up, following Rags’ finger.
The Goblin pointed at the heights of the High Passes. Redscar stared up at the hidden summit, behind the clouds. And he grinned.
“A challenge worthy of Redfangs.”
“Something to do.”
Rags agreed. She smiled. Badarrow looked at her.
“What about this?”
Rags patted the bench.
“Goblinhome? Goblinhome remains. And Goblins come here. Get larger, bigger. Safety.”
She nodded to them. And the others nodded. Rags yawned. She sat back, as Badarrow offered Snapjaw a blanket he’d brought. And she shared a drink. Redscar sighed as Rags closed her eyes. The four Goblins sat together. And Rags closed her eyes. She slept peacefully, for the first time in a while.

And the Dragon paused, after the little Goblin had left. He thought about their conversation.
Such a small thing, a whim. For him. But it had mattered. He looked at the Dragonthrone. And he shook his head.
“She was strong. For one so young. But then—they are so young. And even their Goblin Kings…”
Teriarch remembered the past. And it could be painful. But he could see a Goblin King, standing in front of him. One of many. And Goblins. They blurred together. And they became the little Goblin.
“Once again, and yet again. Let it be.”
The Dragon began to slumber, and dream of ages past, long conversations he himself had forgotten. But before he did, he idly opened one eye.
“Ah. Those pestilential Wyverns. Hm.”
Yawning, the Dragon idly composed something in his head, sent it off with just a thought. Then he settled back.
And a [Message] arrived in the Mage’s Guild in Liscor. And in Pallass. And in every Mage’s Guild within two hundred miles of the High Passes. The kind of [Message] that made the [Scribes] pause and slip as they transcribed. The kind to make someone look twice as it was rushed to the Adventurer’s Guild.
A…notice. A bounty. It read as follows:
 
Forsooth! The Frost Wyvern population in the High Passes is getting out of control! A particularly aggressive Weyr of Wyverns has descended and is causing havoc. Any brave adventurers of good courage and skill at arms should rid the good folk plagued by this menace! For their deeds of valor, each shalt receive a reward of the following:
