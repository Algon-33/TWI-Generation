She has many gifts.
 
That’s the problem, isn’t it? Many gifts. A nice home. A rich family with a father who is influential. All the things to make me spoiled. Useless.
 
I have not built anything. Lost anything. I have nothing to fight for. No cause. I am not a rebel without a cause because I have nothing to rebel against.
 
Society. But that’s just an excuse. I hate everything and everyone. Sometimes. Another excuse.
 
I am a prisoner. But not one tethered by social class or money or any of the things that most people struggle against. I am a victim of my success. I have never had anything I truly needed.
 
Question. What does Ryoka Griffin need?
 
So useless. I came here to deliver something and there’s nowhere else to go. I wouldn’t even know where to start. There are no clues. This is an empty place. Do I just start running in a random direction and pray I find—something?
 
Teriarch. That bastard. Giving me a useless mission. How dare he order me—
 
He seemed sure this Az’kerash existed, though. And he is powerful. But something is off about that mage. Is he an Elf? Who lives in such a dangerous place with no apparent defenses? Even if they were magical, why didn’t I trip them?
 
I am lost. Bereft. What do I do now?
 
Question. What is Ryoka Griffin’s next step?
 
What do I want? After I deliver the ring and letter and go back to Teriarch, then what? Do I keep running?
 
No—learn magic. From—not Ceria. Someone else. Learn more magic without those stupid Classes and Levels. Learn spells—a way to run faster? Something to defend myself with. Earn money. Once I have enough to buy potions and keep myself fed wherever I go I can start travelling.
 
Where? …Anywhere.
 
And then I’ll climb the highest mountains. I’ll go out at sea and see the full fury of an ocean storm for myself. I’ll see all this world has to offer. I will test myself against this world and see wonders. That is my dream. That is what I’ve always wanted to do.
 
To be alone.
 
To be free.
 
To hold my own destiny.
 
And then I’ll die. At some point my luck or my body will run out. If I keep climbing mountains, eventually I will fall. That is the knowledge every climber lives with. If I keep running eventually I will stop. But that’s enough. If I can live enough, that would be fine.
 
What does Ryoka Griffin want? Answer:
A place to die.
 
It’s wrong.
 
I know. But there’s nothing else for me. The only joy I’ve ever felt is in the moment when I run past my limits, take a breath at the top of the world. Stare up at the night sky and feel insignificant realizing how vast this infinite universe is.
There must be something else. Something. Or else all you’re looking for is a way to kill yourself.
 
What does Ryoka Griffin want? Addendum:
Something to die for. Something worthy of dying for.
 
I would have been a charity worker in my world when I graduated from college. Or—a soldier. A mercenary perhaps. A vigilante? A firefighter. Nothing that was safe. Nothing that would fit with the grain. I’d always be trying to push at the limits. Find something worth giving everything towards.
 
I hurt them. I made them suffer. And they were good. If—
 
Too late. I’m broken. A jagged piece of glass who cuts everything that touches me.
 
I wish there was another way. I guess I’ll keep searching until I run out of food. What else do I have? What else could I do?
 
What does Ryoka Griffin lack? Answer:
A friend.
 
My thoughts—grind to a halt. I stop. For a second I turn and stare back the way I’ve come.
 
Yes.
No. It’s stupid.
 
But.
