“Yes. You will live. Sleep now, Gamel. Sleep—and rest while I can still let you.”
He closes his eyes. I can’t tell if he’s dying or not. I put my hand on his chest and feel nothing.
I look around. The lines of bodies are long. But I sense many chests rising and falling.
Thirty one dead, forty six wounded. Of that number, eight had wounds that could not be healed with potions. A young man lost three fingers. A wife a leg. One of Berniar’s riders lost an eye. Some should have died from the wounds they took.
But they lived. Because I commanded it. They lived when many should have died.
The Mossbear is gone. It left after eating some of the dead Goblins. I think it was wounded, but not deeply. Wiskeria summoned it from its cave.
A last resort. An emergency measure. That’s why she wanted the fur.
These are all numbers I see. In my mind. But it doesn’t change reality. I stare at the few people who are upright. Some are still holding their weapons. A shovel, a rake, a frying pan of all things. But they killed with them. The blood is still on some.
I have made warriors of these humble folk. I have turned farmers into killers and taught them what death is. Is there anyone who wouldn’t be changed by such an experience? They have killed.
Goblins. They killed Goblins. But Goblins are too much like people. The people of Riverfarm and Windrest will remember this day for the rest of their lives.
Prost finds me kneeling next to Gamel. He takes me away for a moment. When he speaks, it’s a simple statement.
“You saved us.”
“You saved yourselves.”
“No.”
He shakes his head.
“You saved us. I felt it. When you spoke—”
“I manipulated you. I took away your will. I forced you to—I had no right. Surely you agree.”
He shakes his head again. There’s pain in Prost’s eyes. His wife was the one who lost her leg. But his children are alive. I look into his eyes and see little gratitude. It hurts too much for that. But neither do I see anger or hatred, either.
“Not for us to say, my Emperor. We are yours. We gave all we had to you for our lives, and that of our families. We are sworn to you. Servants, subjects to a ruler. If we wished for freedom, we could only but rebel and break our oaths. We would be damned for that.”
“Some oath. What do you get, then?”
“You, lord.”
I look at Prost. He reaches out.
“You. We are yours and you are ours. So it is for every ruler and his people. They are his, or hers. And they belong to their people. One cannot live without the other. For better or worse, they are bound until one is gone.”
“Is it a Skill? Part of my class?”
For the first time in a long while, I see Prost smile. He shakes his head.
“It is not just part of classes and levels. It is the bond we have made. You gave us hope and purpose. You gave us life when the snow buried our home and our families. You pulled us out with your bare hands. How could we not give you everything we have in return?”
He leaves me with that. I go back and find Wiskeria. She’s sobbing over one of her friends. When she sees me she bows her head.
“I don’t know what—I heard you. I felt you. I—I can’t go back to Invrisil after this. I can’t.”
I kneel as she chokes on her words. She looks at me with tears in her eyes.
“Part of me died here. Part of the Celestial Trackers. We’re gone. We put too much of ourselves into that battle.”
Of the Trackers, four out of twelve survived. Of the Windfrozen Riders, five. I look at Wiskeria. At her as she is, raw, grieving. It’s not the time. But there’s nothing else I can give her.
