“Marian! Marian! Maelstrom’s Howling is making moves! The Professor was right!”
The voice came back, frantic.
“I know! Dead gods! I thought this was just a lesson, but maybe the Professor sent Kissilt and Cameral because he thought we needed backup! I’m trying to investigate—I’m going to be pulling these Bushrangers around! I’ll tell Kissilt not to break our cover. That fathead nearly gave it all away when he saw me! Just keep observing!”
The Lizardgirl nodded. She saw Geneva close the door to her office, but she hadn’t figured out how to tap the office yet. Nor had she figured out how to convince Geneva that she wanted to meet the Titan of Baleros. But she would.
Inside the office, Geneva Scala sat down. She spoke, very slowly.
“Okasha. I do not want to get into a relationship with Timashi. Even for a night.”
“But I do. What if we flip for it? Huh?”
The [Doctor] produced a coin. Geneva shook her head. Her voice was quiet. But she had to say it. It was time to say—
“Okasha. I am not comfortable with being with Timashi. Even if it is ‘your time’. I am not—willing to do this.”
“But it’s our body, Geneva.”
Okasha’s voice was reasonable. Friendly. Geneva began to shiver. And stopped.
“Okasha. I think it’s time to talk about our relationship. This is my body. I’m grateful for everything you’ve done to help me. But—this is my body. Do you understand?”
There was only silence for a second. Geneva tried to move. But then—she began to chuckle. And then laugh.
The [Doctor] threw her head back. And she stood up and laughed, spreading her arms as she looked at herself in the little mirror on her desk. And Okasha laughed at Geneva.
“Geneva. You mean, our body, don’t you? Let’s talk. I was thinking it was about time too.”
And she kept laughing.

Umina listened to the [Doctor] laughing in her office. And she had no idea why. At the gold? That could make anyone laugh. Umina’s eyes had popped when she saw the donations.
But this laughter was different. And the [Doctor] was—talking to herself? Umina saw her sit down behind the closed shades. She began to edge closer, to listen, looking around to see if the other [Nurses] or patients were watching.
Then the speaking stone chirped. Marian’s voice came through, frantic.
“Umina! Umina! Another huge development! Can you get out of the clinic? You have to see this!”
“What? What?”
The Lizardgirl clapped a claw over the speaking stone, looking around. Marian shouted back; she was galloping towards something.
“You’re not going to believe this—”

Geneva, Okasha, sat in her chair. And she looked at herself. She smiled.
“You know, Geneva. You never appreciated me. Not once. No ‘thank you, Okasha’. No appreciation for the hard work I do. And you know what? It’s hard work. When you drink like a [Sailor], who manages your liver? When you overwork, who takes care of your muscles? Maintains your body? Me. And you just don’t know how hard it is.”
Geneva looked at Okasha.
“I’m sorry. I’m—thoughtless.”
“Oh? Like the thirty-hour work sessions where I beg you to rest? And you don’t listen? Me, stuck in here for months before you let me have a few hours to be myself? I can’t leave because you’re paralyzed.”
Okasha snapped back, poking at the mirror. She took a few breaths, luxuriating in the feeling.
“Well—it’s okay. I like you, Geneva. I really do. You’re so—caring. But you can’t take care of yourself. That’s what I’ve learned. You need me. It was a good thing we came together.”
“That I was paralyzed?”
The Italian woman’s eyes were locked on herself, unblinking. She saw her lips curve upwards.
