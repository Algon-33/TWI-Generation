Some followed. A girl. A young man from Canada named Rémi. But fifteen entered. The young man from Portugal, Davi, was unsettled. He filmed the inside. The cavernous room, the smiling people. 
The strange cries of a baby. The meat they were given, succulent, free of charge by Athal, who grinned as Davi and the others scarfed the food after a long time on the road.
 
“Stop.”
Fetohep was touching Trey’s arm. The young man didn’t know it, but he was crying. His finger shook. But the last video—
 
“Something. Wrong.”
A voice. Cracked. In pain. Davi’s face appeared in the frame. In darkness.
In the background, someone was crying out. Rhythmically. In pain. Davi was clutching at his stomach.
“The meat—it was—a trap.”
He whispered to the camera. Someone was moving in the corner. Davi looked up. He saw the man from Cameroon. With a knife, stained red. He reached down, his body jerking. He was already…transforming. Davi shook his head as the knife lowered—the man staggered away.
“What did we do wrong?”
That was all Davi said. He tried to say something else. But the broadcast continued. As he jerked—the others fell silent, given a last mercy or…too far gone.
They changed. And a young man picked his way across the ground, ignoring the pakheil as they screamed. Athal picked up the camera, investigated it eagerly.
“Look! An artifact! They had an artifact! Tell my father—we can sell this—how does it work? Why is that thing flashing red? One? 1%? What—”
 
That was the last. Trey saw the screen go dark.
There were a few…pictures. Of Athal. Of a few people, blinking stupidly into the camera. He must have used it. But the camera had run out of power. And Athal must have thought it was just junk. So he’d put it in the bag. And the pakheil—Davi—had remained.
Until he’d attacked Trey. And then—
“He’s still there. In A’ctelios. He’s probably alive, even after he was—nothing dies there. He’s alive. And he’s—him.”
Trey wept onto the camera as it turned off. Fetohep sat next to him. Staring at the dark screen.
He had witnessed it all. The [King] was silent. And Trey?
He had tried to kill Baosar. He had failed, but Gazi had done the job. Trey wished now, he’d killed Athal. That he’d had the power to burn A’ctelios Salash to ash.
But they’d run. And Davi was still alive. Part of Trey wished he’d never known the young man’s name. Because it was his face Trey saw in his nightmares. Eating down the meat and remarking how good it was. Thanking the inhabitants of Tombhome for their generosity.
“I will never forgive them. I won’t. Someday. I’ll come back. And I’ll bury Tombhome again. I will kill them all.”
That was his vow. Trey looked up at Fetohep. And the undead ruler looked at him with sympathy.
“Trey Atwood. This evidence of wrongdoing by A’ctelios’ inhabitants I cannot forgive. Nor will I ever forget it. The Carven City will be held to my justice. Khelt is not weak.”
“It has to be erased.”
The young man reached out. He grasped at Fetohep’s robes, speaking pleadingly. And Fetohep—hesitated.
“There are things worse than A’ctelios’ depravity, Trey Atwood. I do not ask that you understand. But I rule Khelt. And I have seen Crelers and worse. A’ctelios is madness. But it is a weapon to be borne against all foes. It is—”
“Madness? Madness is a weapon? What enemy do you use it against?”
Trey looked at Fetohep. And the undead ruler’s fiery eyes dimmed. But he replied.
“Dragons. And far worse. When they are needed, A’ctelios’ mad legions will fight.”
“So you won’t destroy them.”
