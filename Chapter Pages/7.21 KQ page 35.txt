He was good. Not that the [Sword Captain] wasn’t winning, but the [Prince] had an innate sense of battle. The [Sword Captain] was twice as fast as he was, but The Griffin Prince’s skill with his axe and buckler was learned from combat experience. He managed to deflect another slash just based on the other man’s posture. The [Prince] charged in and the [Captain] cursed, unprepared for the bold move.
“Get him!”
The [Griffin Riders] roared as The Griffin Prince slashed with the axe. The [Sword Captain]’s eyes widened.
“[Flicker Step]!”
He vanished out of the way. The [Prince] pursued. The [Sword Captain] gritted his teeth. He stepped back.
“[Blade Art: Eighteen Silverfish]!”
The young man brought up his buckler with a curse. The other man’s blade blurred. And the lancing cuts struck at the [Prince]. But he’d dodged back just out of range; the tips of the sword cut into his body, drawing blood, but shallowly.
Still, the Griffin Prince staggered. And the [Sword Captain] saw his chance. He leapt forwards, body flickering. His Skills enhanced his movement. His sword came up, enhanced again by Skills and magic.
“[Decapitation Slice].”
A second Skill. It could be dodged, but the cut was perfect. The Griffin Prince jerked backwards—
His head hit the ground. The body fell. The [Sword Captain] heard the Griffin Riders fall silent.
The [Farmer] and his family screamed in shock. The [Sword Captain] staggered. He must have—taken the [Prince] by surprise. Panting, he whirled.
But The Griffin Prince’s escort was frozen in shock. The [Captain] laughed shakily. He turned to the [Mercenaries].
“Send word to his Majesty. The Griffin Prince of Kaliv is dead! He—”
The man saw one of the [Mercenaries] go white. He spun. And then the [Sword Captain]’s blood froze in his veins.
He had cut the [Prince]’s head off. He had. But the body was standing back up. And the head was back on his shoulders. Red gore was visible from inside; skin and bone had been cut.
But it was reattaching itself. Black thread was stitching the wound closed. And the young man’s head was looking at the [Sword Captain].
Sadly. The black thread sewed the gaping wound closed. And then disappeared, becoming flesh. The Griffin Prince grimaced, wincing with the pain. And he shook his head. His voice was somber as he gestured at the [Captain]’s crimson blade.
“Brave warrior. You will need a better blade than that to free me from my curse.”
He walked forwards slowly. The man from Ailendamus went white. His surefootedness was suddenly gone. He stumbled backwards.
“Monster.”
The [Captain] whispered it. He had heard rumors. But this? He looked at his sword.
“It’s magical. I killed you.”
“Weak magic. My sin runs deeper than that. Now. Put up your sword and surrender. Or die.”
The [Sword Captain] hesitated. Then he closed his eyes.
“Men! Kill them!”
The [Mercenaries] hesitated. But the Griffins screamed and attacked. There was nowhere to run. Lily aimed her bow, shot one [Mercenary] from the saddle. Then she drew a spear.
“Up! Knives, up! Dive!”
Knives, her Griffin, flew upwards, and the five [Griffin Riders] dove at the [Mercenaries] who shot arrows and spells upwards. The Griffin Prince’s mount fought on the ground, shielding the [Farmers].
And the [Prince] and the [Sword Captain] fought a second time. This time the [Warrior] used all of his Skills.
“[Flash Cut]! [Flicker Step]! [Sword Art—]. Die, damn you!”
The [Prince] charged into him. He wasn’t using any Skills! He just—knew battle. More than the [Sword Captain], who was nearly a decade his elder. He took a cut across the face, but kept coming.
