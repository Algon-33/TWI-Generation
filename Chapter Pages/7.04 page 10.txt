Bird shouted for the first time, in actual distress. Erin tried to talk over him. Lyonette raised one finger.
“Bird, it’s only for one week. And listen—you caused an awful lot of—”
“Bird, be quiet and listen to us—”
The Worker ignored both of them. He flailed his four arms and began to kick the air. The Fortress of Fluff fell down around him.
“Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Wah. Waaaaaaaaah! Waaah!”
“Bird—”
Erin stared at him. Was he—crying? The Antinium could not cry. But Bird was imitating a wailing baby. Well, he was shouting the word ‘wah’. But it was similar. Erin looked helplessly at Lyonette. The [Princess] was staring at Bird.
“Waaah! Waaah! Wah! Waaaaaaaah! I am crying! Is it working?”
Lyonette was opening her mouth. Erin felt the [Princess]’ aura gathering. But—Erin looked at Bird. She thought of the blue flame she could conjure. She put out a hand and Lyonette looked at her. Erin took a deep breath as Bird kept shout-crying. She focused.
“Bird! Be quiet!”
The air—went still. It wasn’t pressure so much as weight. Erin focused. And below, for an instant, her guests looked around, feeling a huge—weight on their shoulders. Not pressure—Erin remembered making her inn shake with force. But this was different.
She concentrated. The area of effect narrowed, until it was only the room. She felt Lyonette pushing back. Erin focused on Bird. The Worker’s flailing slowed. He wasn’t being crushed. She was just…weighing him down.
Focus. Erin wanted him to be serious. She didn’t lean. It was an odd sensation in her mind. Unlike any other sense Erin had ever employed. She couldn’t explain it, but she’d done it before. Now, doing it intentionally, Erin felt fatigued. But that was enough. Erin released the weight.
Then she put both her hands on Bird’s shoulders. And he stilled, looking at her. Erin spoke slowly, looking into Bird’s multifaceted eyes.
“Listen to me, Bird. I know you’re not happy. And young. And I know you like birds and you’re…Bird.”
He opened his mandibles. Erin raised a finger and he went still. Not because of her aura. Just because of her look. Erin stared at him.
Like fire.
“You’re Bird. And you can be silly and wonderful and…young. But I remember when you first came to the inn. You can be serious. You’re smart, Bird. Smarter than anyone thinks because you pretend. Or you—you can be serious. You know you did something bad. And this is punishment. It’s fair. You do understand it, don’t you, Bird?”
He looked at her. Erin waited. He remembered it too. She saw the shaking Aberration in her inn. Heard the distant horns blaring from Liscor. The undead.
“I am Knight.”
The Antinium looked at her. Naming himself. They all did. Her chess club, those brave Workers. Erin still remembered them. The ones who had never had a chance. Named after the legends of chess in her world. Knight, Milner-Barry, Calabrian—
He had been there. Before he was Bird. And the little Worker, bigger than Erin, but little, slowly nodded. And his voice grew…sharper.
“I understand. I do not like it, but I understand.”
No less Bird. But he paused. His tantrum ceased. It wasn’t a child who sat there, looking at Erin and Lyonette. Antinium were never children. This one had found his childhood, but he was still—
Bird. The Worker paused. He bowed his head.
“I am sorry for causing trouble, Erin, Miss Lyonette. I did not mean to. I just wanted to hunt the Wyverns. I will be punished and obey.”
Erin Solstice sat back. She heard Lyonette sigh in relief. Erin looked at Bird.
“Good. You know you can’t go to Pallass, Bird?”
“Yes. I am very sorry.”
