The [Cook] stared at Rags. She stared back.
“Food?”
He nodded. Rags hesitated. She debated between throwing something or casting a spell, but then her stomach rumbled. She folded her arms.
“Fine. But I was dreaming.”
“Food is important. Chieftain is too small.”
So said the [Cook], and his word was, apparently, law. Rags glowered up at him; Calescent wasn’t as heavy as Tremborag; he was stout, not fat. But he insisted Goblins should eat at least twice a day. He knew what it was like to starve.
“Goat?”
“Some attacked.”
Rags paused as she reached for the stone spoon. She looked up urgently.
“Any die?”
“Only goats.”
The [Cook] fluttered his fingers. Rags relaxed. She sipped from the hearty broth. It was good. But also—
“Spicy.”
The spices were hot! Rags took a few bites and felt herself heating up. Calescent disagreed.
“Mild.”
Rags glared at him. But she didn’t argue with the [Chef], and Calescent was a [Chef] these days. He was also, incidentally, one of the most feared fighters outside of the Redfangs. Poisonbite could kill you slowly with her toxins, but if Calescent went into battle he carried a small sack of his hottest spice blends. And he’d throw it in your eyes as he hacked you apart with a cleaver.
“Too hot. Water?”
The [Chef] had a small stone bowl of clear mountain water, but he was reluctant to give it. He pointed out quite sensibly that Rags could eat some of the potato to cut the spices. She glared and held out a claw.
“Water.”
Rags took a sip to quell the burning in her mouth. Then she paused as she stared at herself in the bowl of water.
The reflection was bad, but Rags had seen her image before. And she knew she was…taller.
Just by a few inches. But the little Goblin had grown. Rags had been small, for a Goblin. Young. Now, she was taller.
Not a Hob. She hadn’t gone through the growth spurt like other Goblins had. The Hobs speculated she was too young. But some of the others wondered if it was something different. Either way, Rags was taller.
Older, too. She’d begun bleeding from her crotch too. Which wasn’t pleasant, but it was a shared experience. Closer to an adult.
Taller, older. But not wiser. Or smarter. Just older. More tired. Rags looked at Calescent.
“Good food.”
He glanced at her disapprovingly. Rags hadn’t finished more than half the bowl. To be fair—the [Chef] had loaded it with enough to feed Badarrow to fullness, but Goblins seldom turned down food.
“Not hungry? Can get spice-less food, if you want, Chieftain.”
His tone indicated that this would be a crime against cuisine, but he’d do it. Rags shook her head. She put the bowl down.
“No. No. Get [Shaman]. Um…Snapjaw. You come too. Had memory.”
“Maybe wait for Snapjaw. Busy having sex.”
Rags shrugged. Okay, she’d wait. The [Chef] paused.
“What memory?”
He was referring to her power. The power of all Chieftains and [Shamans], to dream of the past Goblin’s lives. Rags could do it, and the [Shamans] that had come from the Mountain City tribe, but they were all low-level. Ulvama too had died during the battle…
“Dreams. Know how to make…strength drink. Also, more about healing. Have mixture. Write down.”
She looked around. Some of the precious parchment and paper that Rabbiteater’s exploits had bought was sitting on a table. Rags got out of her bed and began to write. Calescent took both bowls and went over.
“What plants?”
“Some…stupid roots! Always roots! And this one. Big, fat. Green leaves, white bulb. Edible.”
“Fennel.”
