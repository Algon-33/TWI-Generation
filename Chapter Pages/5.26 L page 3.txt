“Sometimes you can’t solve other people’s problems even if you want to. Sometimes people have to go through their struggles alone.”
A sad look stole over Erin’s face for a moment. Pawn looked up at her and opened his mandibles hesitantly.
“But why?”
“Why? Because you can’t solve everything for other people.”
“Why not?”
“Because you can’t, Pawn. It just isn’t possible. It’s their problem, not yours.”
Part of Pawn rebelled at what Erin said. He looked at her angrily.
“But that is not right! If someone is hurting, surely they must be helped. Is not leaving them alone worse? It is not right!”
Erin nodded.
“It’s not good, I agree. But you can’t make someone happy. And trying to force your help on someone makes it worse, Pawn.”
“But—”
This was not what he had wanted to hear. Pawn opened and closed his mandibles, softly clicking, trying to say something in response. But he couldn’t. Erin was right. He had gone too far. And he had made Lyonette angry. It was just that he still wanted to help. Erin stared at him, waiting. At last, Pawn asked another question.
“What is a ‘ball’?”
“What?”
Erin blinked. Pawn hunched his shoulders sulkily.
“I want to know. Lyonette told me about it. A ball is for dancing? [Princesses] do it?”
“Um—well, not just them, but yeah. Balls are for dancing. People dress up and dance in a big open room. It’s a fancy thing.”
“Have you ever done it?”
“Nope. Why, did Lyonette miss dancing?”
“A bit. She said she is not a [Princess] here. She has nothing of her old life. But she was a [Princess]. I thought I could give it back. I thought—”
Erin cut Pawn off gently.
“You can’t make her. You can talk to her. I think she’d be happy to talk to you. But not if you’re trying to get her to do something. If you go back tomorrow and say sorry, I think she’ll forgive you. But you can’t keep…its not good to dwell on her problems. She’ll be fine. Okay, Pawn?”
Pawn looked at the ground. He opened and closed his mandibles softly. Erin waited.
“Pawn?”
“Okay.”
He said it in a small voice. Not because he agreed. Just to make Erin stop asking. He knew she was trying to help. He knew she was probably right.
He’d tried to help Lyonette. Too much. That was what she was telling him. But part of Pawn, a small part, rebelled against what Erin was saying.  It wasn’t that. It wasn’t just losing her class. He thought there had to be something more. He’d wanted to—
Pawn didn’t know. He didn’t feel better. He’d hoped that was what Erin could do. Make him feel better. Make everything alright. But she hadn’t. She’d only made him feel—guilty. Awake again. Conscious of his duties, of the people who were hurting.
His Soldiers. His Workers. His…people. Pawn felt a terrible weight settle on his shoulders.
“I have made everyone upset. I do not know if I can be forgiven.”
Erin’s smile lit up part of  Pawn’s heart.
“Of course you can be, silly. Everyone’s upset, but they’re worried. Even mean old Klbkch.”
Pawn nodded a few times. He looked up, hesitantly.
“Will you come with me?”
“Of course.”
Erin watched Pawn slowly stand up. She smiled and hugged him. He let her. She smelled like a bit of rain, fried food, her inn—and humanity. As she let him go she smiled again.
How wonderful. How beautiful. Pawn followed her as she led him out of the barracks. He felt quiet inside. The grief was still there, but subdued for a moment. The guilt and pain—he could live with. She had helped.
