Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 15
The Drake was a bit relieved. She hadn’t been sure, entirely sure what the answer would be. She looked around as the others debated.
“Well, Erin should hear the Earl out. Poor man’s got to go. It’s flattering, really.”
“I’d be intimidated. An Earl?”
“That’s like Goblin Lord, right? Very important?”
Drassi shrugged.
“I don’t kn—”
She jumped. Snapjaw was there. She stared pointedly as Badarrow talked to Numbtongue. He looked around and waved at her. Snapjaw folded her arms.
…Yes. Look at that. Then why hadn’t Erin…? Some were obvious. Olesm had been obvious like the sun. Palt? Ditto. Now, it might be preference. But while Selys could have believed that about another Human, Erin?
Let’s see. Goblins’, and there had been as many as five, but you could understand that. Olesm…Palt…and Culyss?
No, he didn’t count. Selys sighed. She was curious to wonder how the Earl would approach this. He was clearly smart enough to get past Erin’s first defense: obfuscating obliviousness. But could he go the distance?
For that matter—whose side was this group on? The answer, it appeared, was obvious.
They were on the side of the most interesting thing that had dragged them away from their jobs and everything else. The possibility of the L-word. Or possibly the R-word. Not so much the sex word.
But the possibility there was love. Or romance. Or…at least watching the wagon-pileup that might occur. All these things were valid reasons.
“Okay. If he wants to…I don’t know. Lasic—Montressa, Drassi, Selys. What am I supposed to do?”
“What do you mean, ‘do’, Erin?”
Drassi bent down. Lasica folded her arms.
“And why did you ask them?”
“I thought you’d forgotten how dates work—ow!”
Lasica smacked the back of Erin’s head. The others chuckled. But it became clear to almost everyone that the issue was now more than Erin’s objections to being romanced herself.
She was clearly nervous. Afraid. Erin, who had done so much. And why?
Why not? Had not each and every one there not felt the same trepidation? A countless number of fears.
What if I embarrass myself? What if I ruin things? What if I’m hated? What if—
A commonality they all could understand. Well, perhaps not Mrsha or Visma. They looked at each other. And Montressa had it. She glanced at the shuffling Centaur, at Kiish, who’d returned to stare at Erin as if all this was her fault.
“Erin. I think what you should do is just…relax. Can I give you a hand with that?”
“If I could, I would, Montressa. I just don’t know—”
“Don’t do anything. Just be…[Calm].”
It wasn’t any other kind of spell. But the glowing hand made Erin jump—then relax.
“…Hey. That’s better.”
Erin exhaled. Selys saw Drassi give Montressa a thumb-claw up. The [Aegiscaster] nodded.
Next came Jelaqua. The Selphid actually had some good advice as Erin breathed and Mrsha and Visma ran off to find Lyonette. Belgrade had vanished upon hearing a condensed version of what was happening.
“Erin, just relax. Have fun! No one’s expecting anything of you so you don’t have to promise anything. But…take it seriously.”
Erin nearly needed another [Calm] spell.
“H-how, Jelaqua?”
“Well…imagine if you think it’ll work. Look around.”
Erin did. Jelaqua pointed.
“Think it’d work out with that Drake?”
“Culyss? No.”
“Well, there you go. Hey! You! Out! You’re not needed!”
Jelaqua shouted at Culyss. Erin tried to stop her. But the point, however made, worked.
“That’s right. Just—Erin. Just see how it goes. Do you think there’s even a chance? Haven’t you daydreamed about stuff like that before? Like…”
