“No.”
“My friend. I cannot help you anymore. Everything has changed.”
The fae wept. Ryoka knew it. The fae were struggling just to keep the gateway open. Ivolethe pointed at it.
“We cannot be trapped there. Surely we will return. To do battle. But this day—oh, Ryoka. It is just what I feared when I was told of us.”
She shed more frozen tears. Ryoka looked at the Faerie King, watching. Then at Ivolethe.
“What? Can’t you tell me all of it?”
“No. It will give them…strength. You must find it out yourself. Seek the truth. Seek the wind. You will have it now. You can be more than wind. My King.”
She bowed and Oberon nodded. Ivolethe whispered something. Then she kissed Ryoka’s forehead.
“Go with our ways. Seek out…Goblins. Seek out friends.”
“B-but Erin. But everything. What am I supposed to do?”
Ivolethe shook her head.
“The wind can guide you. More than that? I—I do not know anymore. What can we give her?”
She turned, suddenly desperate. The other fae of the court, great figures, all looked at each other.
“Something. A great weapon! Melidore, your sword!”
“It would only become theirs. You know that, Ivolethe.”
The faerie’s eyes closed. Ryoka saw her shoulders hunch. The Wind Runner looked at the trembling gateway.
Back. Back to…what? Failure. It had all fallen apart. Her great meeting, her time with the fae in these lands? She had searched for a cure. And she had failed.
“No. You did not fail. You have changed. And you will bring that with you.”
Ryoka turned. The Faerie King stood next to her. She saw Ivolethe look up, tear-stained eyes wide.
Oberon had no voice of power. He did not need it. He spoke naturally to Ryoka. He was a horned man. A figure with stag horns, like some stories showed him. He looked at Ryoka.
“A terrible foe of ours waits beyond. One we could not match alone. You have seen what it cost us once.”
“Yes. But—”
But what am I supposed to do? The Faerie King smiled.
“Few are ever alone, Ryoka Griffin. But it is a terrible burden. And you bear another.”
He looked up. And Ivolethe’s head rose. Ryoka Griffin faced the King of Faeries.
“There’s a prophecy about me, isn’t there?”
“Yes.”
One fathomless eye regarded her. Ryoka shuddered.
“Is it…like the King of Knight’s fate?”
“Nothing so certain. It is an if. Then. You have come far, Ryoka Griffin. And it may be the journey ahead is painful. This world is.”
He regarded the gateway. So—then. Oberon turned. He bent and regarded her with kindly eyes.
“If you wish it, I will send you to your first home. And let prophecy end.”
He pointed. Ryoka’s head turned. She saw a blank gate spring to life. She gasped. So too did the court of the fae.
“My king—”
Ivolethe cried out. Then went silent. Oberon nodded to her. Then to Ryoka.
“If you wish to abandon it…”
“No.”
He blinked. Once. Ryoka blurted the word out so fast she interrupted him. She caught herself.
“No. I’m sorry, your Majesty. But I’d never choose that. Ever. I have…friends. I can’t run away.”
Go to Earth? Abandon all this? Even if she forgot it—what else was there?
Oberon smiled.
“Very well. Then speak with your friend.”
He stepped to one side, away…towards another hilltop. Ryoka was confused.
“He is so relaxed.”
She confided in Ivolethe. The Frost Faerie looked at him, and then laughed sadly.
“Ryoka Griffin. Ye art the only fool who’d both refuse the Faerie King’s generosity before he even finished speaking and call him relaxed.”
Ryoka blushed. She stood at the fading gateway as Ivolethe looked sadly at her.
“I wish I could help you. But…”
“Faeries aren’t you-know-whats.”
