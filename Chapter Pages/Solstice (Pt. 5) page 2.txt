Solstice (Pt. 5)

“Hold up. I don’t want to hurt you!”
The boy halted. He squinted at Ryoka suspiciously.
“Hurt me? You—intruder! Begone before I tear you limb from limb!”
He swished the stick menacingly at her. Ryoka raised an eyebrow. She had not expected this. But whoever he was, the street urchin’s seeming failed to alarm her.
“Look, kid.”
“How dare you! What are you doing here, you, you—mortal?”
The boy did a double-take. He squinted at Ryoka. Then his jaw dropped.
The stick lowered, to the relief of no one but perhaps the stick. The boy blinked at Ryoka.
“A mortal? Here? After so long? Are the gates open? Hath the Faerie King’s great grief lifted? Her Majesty returned?”
Hope lit up his eyes. Ryoka blinked. Like Nama—she had the definite impression this boy was something else, but she couldn’t tell what it was.
“What? No, no. I just came here for the Summer Solstice.”
The boy tilted his head. His glittering eyes turned shadowed at once.
“Oh. An intruder. So it was you the Winter Court seeks with such passion.”
He grumbled, kicking at a stone. Ryoka saw it fly past her head.
“Watch it, brat.”
“Call me ‘brat’ again and I will kill you, eat you, and shit your remains upon my home for trespassers to find.”
He warned her, raising his stick. Ryoka’s jaw dropped slightly. That was a hell of an insult for a kid. Was he a kid?
“Well, you look like one to me. Sorry…young man? How old are you?”
“Old! Older than you!”
His voice wobbled uncertainly. Ryoka raised one eyebrow.
“Uh huh.”
She was put in mind of Sammial Veltras at once. But the boy was young and old. He regarded Ryoka for a moment then snorted.
“A mortal. Well, if you must pass my lair, do so! I have no wish to deal with frost or a lone mortal on this day. You may pass, mortal, for the novelty of it.”
He pointed, bowing slightly and glancing up at her. Ryoka hesitated.
“…Thanks kid. So I just go over…?”
She pointed at the wall. The boy was immediately furious again as Ryoka climbed towards the pub.
“Kid? How dare you! You insolent—do you know who I am? And where are you going? That wall is there for a reason!”
Ryoka turned her head. Then rubbed at her ears. Was that a faint…hum beneath his words? Or from somewhere else? She pointed at the distant building all aglow.
“I’m trying to go in. By which I mean—”
“I know what you mean! Wrong way, fool! And don’t go over that wall!”
A tug at her arm. Ryoka nearly overbalanced. The boy dragged her back with surprising strength. She pointed.
“But the pub’s…there. See?”
Ryoka tugged at one ear absently. The boy stared at her. Then at the pub. His jaw actually dropped.
“Are you stupid or something? You want to go there?”
He pointed at the shining building. Ryoka gazed at the distant revelers. She shaded her eyes.
“Those are fae, right?”
They looked like the Summer Court. The boy nodded slowly.
“Surely.”
“Then that’s where I want to go. It’s an inn…”
“Of kinds. But you do not want to go there, surely.”
“Yes, I think I do. Look, kid. I’ll just climb over and—”
“Do not!”
He was urgently tugging her backwards now. Ryoka knew something was…off. The kid? There were no kids she’d seen before now, which told her he was someone else. Like Nama. But the inn was so inviting. So warm amid this city.
“You’re staring at it. Look away!”
“I am. See?”
She felt like the inn was the most beautiful thing she had ever wanted. Like she was a…a…moth.
“No, you’re not. Don’t climb over that—”
Ryoka climbed over the wall and wandered across the ruined street towards the inn as the voice became a buzzing in her head. The fae loitering around outside blinked as she approached.
