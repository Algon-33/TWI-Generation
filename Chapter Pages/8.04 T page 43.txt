Two dozen bursts of light tore at the veil. Their leader gasped.
The veil flickers. She heard the warning siren in her mind, and how many times had she ever heard…?
Her daughters cried out in dismay. She rose—and a tide of black water shot across the ruined floor. Eldavin levitated over it; it surged upwards and he cut the spell at the base. The water flooded around and then began to vanish.
“A powerful [Mage] indeed. Daughters—go.”
They hesitated. Then all seven stepped back. The [Depth Mage] stood up—and all eight removed their veils.
What they presented to the [Mages] of Wistram was the same face. One far older than the rest, who were sequentially younger. The same face.
Not just—related. But exactly the same. Just in different stages of age. Half-Human, exceptionally pale of skin because she crewed vessels that sailed dark currents where the sun’s rays were forgotten. And she had learned a magic fitting to that place, supreme in darkness.
The other half of her face? A starfish’s rough skin, reddish, hard. Her daughters, clones of one self.
“Grand Magus Eldavin. Do you pick a fight with the representatives of the Drowned Folk?”
“I pick a fight with anyone and everyone in this moment!”
He snapped back. The half-Elf’s blood was burning. He was half-smiling, half-furious. He strode about the destroyed banquet hall; the woman turned to face him, her fingers moving shadows around her.
“I am Grand Magus Eldavin. And that seems to mean more than it did when I left. I knew Zelkyr of old and Chandler both! They do not even dare to say his name here. But you will respect my will!”
Feor had destroyed the summoned things and was watching Eldavin. His staff poised. Viltach was ready to jump back in, having geared up, furious. The [Depth Mage] was drawing from her daughters. Eldavin was panting, reaching for a mana potion. Both his opponents tensed—
And Eldavin whirled.
“[Spell Purge]!”
He pointed. Both Feor and the [Depth Mage] raised their guards—but Eldavin wasn’t aiming at them. He aimed at a patch of air to his left. It rippled—then vanished. The old half-Elf traced it across the ground.
“Come out before I force you to.”
He growled. The air seemed to quiver—
Then a Centaur trotted out of the air. He looked extremely put out. Everyone stared.
None more than the Ullsinoi. For as he had appeared—
Galei and Taxiela had vanished. And this Centaur was far older than Galei. Moreover?
He had scales amid his fur. On his skin, even face and arms. A product of mixed species. Eldavin’s eyes narrowed.
“Who are you?”
“Call me…Gaxiela. I was just admiring talent from up close.”
The strange [Mage] winked. Eldavin aimed a finger at him. Then whirled left.
Feor, ‘Gaxiela’, the [Depth Mage] of the seas, and Eldavin saw Valeterisa walk towards Eldavin. The half-Elf opened his mouth.
“Y—”
Valeterisa spoke.
“[Bound Fireball], [Bound Fireball], [Lightning Bolt], [Gust of Air], [Burst Arrows of Light], [Thunderclap], [Roving Silent Sickle], [Stone Lance], [Stone Lance], [Stone Lance], [Stone Lance], [Tidal Wave], [Spray of Needles], [Darkness Pool], [Burning Floor], [Merda’s Push], [Multiplied Stone Fists], [Enhanced Flame Spray], [Caustic Acid]—”
Her voice was layered multiple times, such that she was casting multiple spells—and sped up. Feor saw Eldavin—vanish in a spectacle of lights.
Everyone clapped their hands to their ears, except those smart enough to have used spells already. When Trey could see and hear again, he saw Eldavin, panting, laying sprawled on the ground.
