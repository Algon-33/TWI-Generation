The City Runner sat there, shivering. Lupp looked at her with old eyes. Then he laughed.
“No. I thought so too. It would’ve been me there, after my wife. I checked the barn three times. But no. He left.”
Ryoka started. She looked up at Lupp. Then she laughed, hoarsely, and grabbed the drink. They’d had the same conclusion. But—then she stopped, the bitter liquid at her lips.
They’d had the same conclusion. She lowered the cup, looked at Lupp.
“This farmer. Why did he leave?”
Lupp tossed his shot down.
“Because he was a miserable bastard. Was for over ten whole years. I never asked. But I think he hated every second of being a [Farmer] that last few years. But he stayed—it was a family business. His father was a good [Farmer]. The man buried him and tried to be a great [Farmer]. But he wanted to do something else.”
He looked at Ryoka.
“Needed to. Something ate away at him until he was hollow inside. Just like you, Miss Griffin.”
The City Runner looked at Lupp. She grinned, honestly.
“Yeah. You saw right through me.”
“Strange. I don’t know my own daughter. But I look at you and sometimes it’s like staring into a mirror. It’s not good for such a young woman.”
Lupp raised his glass, eyed it, and put it down. Ryoka rested her arms on her knees.
“There is something. I have…something to do. Those young people I mentioned? I helped them—because I wanted something from them. Something valuable.”
“Really?”
The [Farmer] didn’t ask questions. He saw Ryoka shift, nearly touch the bag of holding. In it were a laptop, devices.
Treasure.
But Ryoka Griffin just looked up.
“Yes. Something very valuable. There’s something I’ve been meaning to do, Lupp. But it’ll take a while. I could—die.”
“If it’s not a secret, what is it?”
The young woman sat in silence. She looked up, slowly.
“That [Witch]. Belavierr. When it was all over, she met me one last time, Lupp. And she made me an offer.”
The [Farmer]—stopped. He looked at the young woman, swimming in the shadows by candlelight.
“They say a [Witch]’s bargains are something you should never take lightly. And seldom agree to. Dire methods for dire need.”
“Oh, yes. They’re right about that.”
Ryoka exhaled. She looked up at Lupp. And her eyes were also glistening a bit.
“The thing is—they always offer what you want the most. I didn’t tell you this, Lupp. But I’ve gotten my friends killed. People like me here. Fierre, Alber—everyone in Reizmelt. But I left all my mistakes behind. In the south. People died because of me.”
“Sometimes that happens. Sometimes a fellow has to run far away. No shame in that.”
The [Farmer] watched the candles flicker lower. He sat across from the City Runner. Ryoka took another gulp of liquid that burned.
“Yeah. But you can’t run forever. I should know. You get really tired. Lupp. My best friend’s name was Ivolethe. She wasn’t like you or me. She died saving me. But you know what?”
“Yes?”
“She’s alive.”
Ryoka’s eyes burned. She looked up at the [Farmer] and clenched her hand so tightly the glass cracked. Ryoka let go, looked at Lupp.
“Alive. But I’ll never see her. That was her—punishment. It’s not distance. It’s…a curse. Magic. The kind only a [Witch] could undo.”
The [Farmer] looked steadily at Ryoka. She didn’t know if any of this was even coherent. But maybe it was to him, who lived in a world of magic.
