The Bloodfeast Raiders came through the gates. The first houses began to explode as they cast their spells. Ryoka Griffin muttered as she tried to stand.
“…my fault.”
She touched her shoulder. And her head went white. The young woman rolled over. She stared at the sky and thought she heard them laughing. Amid the cries of fear.
Celum. This was Celum. Ryoka was so glad…it wasn’t Liscor. Or Erin’s inn. She covered her eyes, as if this was a dream. The City Runner whispered.
“I’m back. Did you miss me?”
She tried to not to cry before the blackness and screaming became one.

She woke up covered in ash. Someone was shaking her.
“Ryoka? Ryoka?”
The young woman looked up. Someone familiar was speaking to her. She looked up and saw—Fals.
He was covered in the same layer of black ash and soot that she was. For a moment—Ryoka couldn’t fathom why. Then she sat up and saw.
“Oh.”
Celum was gone. The northern gates were torn open, the walls collapsed in seven places. Scorch marks littered the battlements. But that was nothing to what the city itself had endured.
Houses, wooden, fragile housing had gone up in smoke. The [Fireballs] had wiped out a third of the city by themselves and the flames—almost half. In the raid, no one had fought the fires.
Few had even fought the [Raiders]. Ryoka saw people wandering around. Bodies being dragged out over overturned houses. She was—lying among the ash.
Perhaps that was why the [Raiders] hadn’t found her. Fals had. The City Runner had a potion in one hand. He seemed shocked to see her.
“Is that you? Ryoka? They said someone called the alarm…your shoulder.”
“Fals?”
Ryoka blinked at him. Then she felt at her shoulder. The potion had closed the wound—but it still hurt. Phantom pain. She looked at Fals, the dried blood on her clothes.
“I’m so sorry.”
“For what?”
He gave her an uncomprehending look. Ryoka tried to stand up. He caught her.
“Steady. You were hit. Ryoka—lie down. I’ll get a [Healer].”
“No. This is my fault. I have to—”
“You warned us. Erin’s been looking for you, Ryoka. Where have you been?”
“Reizmelt.”
“Where?”
The young woman shook her head. Fals was carrying her. He looked—burnt. She tried to ask what happened. He brushed it away.
“Pulling people out of the fires. We couldn’t stop them; the rains started after the [Raiders] left.”
“They’re gone?”
He nodded, face blank. Even hatred wasn’t enough—so he was just cold.
“Three hours ago. They destroyed the city for nearly an hour, then just—left. Reinforcements arrived from Remendia, Wales, Ocre—after they were convinced the Bloodfeast Raiders had gone.”
He pointed at [Soldiers], militia from other cities helping bury the bodies. No one in Celum was doing much. They were just—walking around. Looking for something.
Normalcy.
Ryoka Griffin let Fals take her down the street. Then she said something. He leaned over.
“What?”
“Runner’s Guild. Or—or City Watch. I have to make a report.”
Worriedly, the City Runner checked Ryoka. She was healed, but—her face was white.
“Ryoka. We should get you to The Wandering Inn.”
“Door’s gone. So’s Octavia.”
“She’s in Liscor. Look—Wailant has a door. Just sit down. Help will be coming. I’ll send a [Message] to Wailant when I can, or run over. Just sit—”
“No. Runner’s Guild. I have to…”
Fals gave up. He steered Ryoka towards the Guild. It was as good a place as any to rest.
