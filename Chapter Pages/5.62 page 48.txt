He was dying. He was already dead. But some part of him held death back. He sat at a table, slumped over. He turned his head as Erin stopped. She stared at him. A—face stared back.
Perhaps he had been handsome once. Perhaps his smile had once been reassuring. His eyes might have terrified. He might have inspired hope, or confidence, or hatred. But now he was just dead. She stared at the Goblin.
“You’re him.”
He took a breath.
“Yes.”
They stared at each other. Erin looked around.
“You’re dead.”
“Almost.”
It was a dream. In a trance, Erin walked forwards. She poked at his side. The Goblin didn’t wince.
“Does it hurt?”
“No.”
“What do you want?”
“Just to sit here. Until it ends.”
“Oh. Okay.”
Erin took a seat across from him. The Goblin stared at her. He was taller than her, but not as tall as he’d seemed. He looked tired.
“Can I get you anything?”
“Nothing.”
“Okay. You…speak well.”
“Yes. I learned to long ago.”
The two stared at each other. Erin trembled.
“Tell me this is a dream.”
“I wish it were.”
The Goblin Lord looked at her. Erin shook.
“Why did you do it?”
“I’m sorry.”
It wasn’t an answer. Erin punched at him. Something broke. The Goblin Lord’s head lolled back. And then forwards. His voice was quiet when he spoke. Sad.
“I never wanted this. I only wanted my people to be safe. For there to be a place—one place in this world—where Goblins could live. One place.”
Erin didn’t respond. She buried her head in her hands. Reiss looked around. His eyes reflected nothing but death. He whispered.
“I never wanted this. But I wanted this. I wanted to take something from them. Everyone who had taken from me. I wanted—to hurt them.”
“It’s not right. They did nothing wrong.”
“Didn’t they? They lived while my people died. That’s enough.”
“It’s not the same. They didn’t know.”
“They kill Goblins for sport. For money. Like rats. Monsters.”
“I know. I know. And I hate them for it.”
Erin whispered. The Goblin Lord nodded.
“You hate them as I do.”
“I do. But I’m one of them.”
“So. What do you do? Do you kill them? Or are you on their side?”
The Goblin Lord looked at her. Erin shook her head.
“I—I don’t. How could I? But I don’t kill Goblins either. I—there’s a sign.”
“A sign?”
She got up to show him. The Goblin Lord read it. And he laughed. He laughed and laughed, wheezing until there was no air in his lungs.
“And this works?”
“No. I don’t think it ever works. But I keep it up. And I give Goblins food. I—I tried to keep them safe. And they died for me.”
“That is what we do. It was not your fault. It was their choice. And his fault. And mine.”
The Goblin Lord nodded jerkily. He looked at Erin. She was curled up in her chair.
“I asked them to fight.”
“They would have anyways. They loved you, I think.”
“I wish they hated me.”
“How could they? You fed them. You gave them—things. You cared. They followed you. I wish I had seen it.”
“It was beautiful.”
Erin closed her eyes. The dead Goblin smiled. Then the smile vanished.
“If only I had seen it. If only I had been there. I wish I had met you long ago. If I had—”
He broke off. Erin looked up. Blood had stopped running from his wound long ago. Erin could see his lungs inflating slowly. Bone and flesh lay exposed. But Reiss refused to die.
“This isn’t our world. We’re just monsters. Why? We didn’t ask…we didn’t want to be. Why us?”
The Goblin Lord spoke bitterly. He looked past Erin.
“From the start we were made like this. Enemies. From the very start. That was what he said. Why us? Was it punishment?”
