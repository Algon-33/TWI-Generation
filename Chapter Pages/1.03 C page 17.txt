I stop. I don’t know where I am, but I suddenly see something at odds with the brightly lit passageways behind me. Ahead, there are no mage lights. Only blackness. Thick and consuming.
“What? What’s…?”
I look over my shoulder. A shining light hangs in the hallway behind me. Ahead of me…darkness. No light.
I feel a chill. What’s this? This is like a bad—bad horror movie. Or something else. I look at the light behind me again. And then ahead.
“Hello?”
The darkness…calls to me. I take a step forwards. Where are the mage lights? They have to be here. They said—
This is it. I’ve gone insane. Or this is real. I reach out and my hand is suddenly grasping a knife.
Darkness. It can’t be a coincidence. In a castle where the light is supposed to be on all the time? I feel a presence. And I know.
“This is it, isn’t it? You’re here. You’re messing with me. It isn’t just me. Is it?”
No response. I take a step forwards, hesitate. Every instinct tells me I should back away from the darkness. But why? I have nothing to lose. And if I turn away, I’ll always wonder if I was going crazy or not.
If I die, at least I’ll know. I walk forwards, knife at the ready.
“I won’t run. Not this time. I’m coming for you, do you hear me?”
My voice is loud, but still sucked up by some kind of unnatural silence. I walk forwards. Now I can barely see anything. But I can hear…something.
Whispering. Footfalls. I turn my head. Nothing’s there. The voice in my head is gone.
I feel something is nearby.
“I know you’re there. Come on.”
A movement. I spin. Just the darkness. I really am losing it.
It’s in my head. It’s right here. I’m going insane. This is reality. The darkness closes in, and then I think I see a light. I feel my way down a corridor. Yes, there’s something ahead of me.
Is this it? Suddenly, I see a bright light and realize I’m an idiot. One of the mage lights just went out! And I thought…I thought…
I’m losing it. But then I walk forwards a bit more and realize it’s not a mage light ahead. Instead, I see advancing ghostly blue flame. A…lantern’s light. Yes, ahead of me. Moving.
Dark. A flicker of movement. My heart races. There is something here. Something—
Him. Me.
Then I step closer, and see what’s holding the light. The figure turns, and the lantern swings. I see a face like leather, two horns curving downwards, bright green eyes—
A Demon soldier stands with lantern in hand, a bloody sword in the other. I stop, staring. He stares back. And behind him, I see a man with his back against the wall, next to an ornate door. He sees me at the same time I see him.
“Fool?”
He half turns towards me and I see his eyes widening. He shouts.
“Get away, Tom! Warn the others! There are Demons—”
The Demon soldier whirls around. He raises his sword with a snarl and the Fool raises his hands. The Demon strikes low.
He slashes the Fool’s belly open, pulling out a chunk of his insides. The Fool gasps, grips onto the Demon as if to hold him there. The masked Demon lowers him almost gently to the floor, and turns towards me. His horns flash in the light of the lantern he’s holding.
I back away. This is a nightmare. Only, it’s not one I thought would be here. My hand raises, it shakes as I hold the knife in front of me. And now I hear the voice.
Kill him. You know you want to.
“Stay back!”
The Demon advances on me. Then he stops. A hand grasps his cloven feet. The Fool. He whispers something up at the Demon. The soldier turns and kicks the Fool in the face. I hear a crack and the Fool goes still.
