Two out of my six chapters have gone my way, but I’m still stressed because it’s not about getting a passing grade, I need a 100%. Each chapter needs to get everything in it and do it well enough. Did I pass this one? Let me know, and hopefully you see me next chapter with more dreams. Seriously. I’m not making this up. I am having weird dreams.
