Imani hesitated. She looked down at Mrsha, and felt a kindred spirit. And Lyonette watched. Numbtongue stood with Bird, observing the way the seven children looked at that magical place. Looking at Imani.
She hadn’t ever been safe. Felt safe. She had come into this world and it had been purely unfair to her. Without reason, or logic. Bad things had happened, and there was no excuse for it.
They knew that full well. The [Princess], the [Druid], the [Bard], the [Innkeeper], and the [Hunter]. That was one of the things that unified them. Casual cruelty by mocking fate.
But look. The Gnoll girl led the young woman into the garden. A safe, magical place. The little champion led a frightened stranger into a beautiful place. Up a hill. And Imani’s voice caught as she found the hilltop.
It was empty, for her. But she sat there and felt—safe. She closed her eyes as the big Gnoll girl sat next to her and offered a little yellow flower that shone with gold. And she breathed easier.
For here was safety. You felt it in the air. Rose gasped as she saw the Sage’s Grass. Kevin blinked around.
“No way. What is this?”
“A safe place. The safest place I know of.”
Erin answered for him. A [Druid] had been granted entrance to this place despite her Skill, but that was probably his class. But Grimalkin had not, with all his power. So she had to believe it was secure. If you tried to enter with malicious intent, you would have to break this inn first. Erin Solstice had made this garden. And it was safe.
She looked from face to face. And then she said it, complete.
“I’m Erin Solstice. This is my inn. This is my place. And you’re welcome to stay here a while.”
Lyonette smiled. And her eyes lit up. She saw Mrsha, her darling daughter, sitting with Imani on the hilltop. And Lyonette felt something rising in her. A certainty. She walked up the hill, and her new Skill burned in her chest.
Something to inspire. Maviola looked at Olesm. That was what he needed. And she told him that. Fire was honest.
“No one ever gave you your fire. It was always in you. They just lit the spark. You let it go out. But it’s still there. I know it.”
The Drake wanted to believe. But he too was no fool. He ducked his head.
“You say that. But I can’t just—change. I needed Erin. Maybe she didn’t make me. But I needed her.”
“I know. You’re like—charcoal.”
“Thanks? In that I’m single-use?”
“No! Listen, you idiot. You’re capable of doing so much. But sometimes you need a push. Sometimes someone is good in a group instead of alone. And that’s fine. You just need a spark.”
She grabbed him, and turned, laughing. The air shone with dancing magical sparks. Like fireflies. Olesm looked around. Maviola was—igniting. Her black hair began to turn to flame. His eyes widened.
“Who are you? Really?”
The [Lady] smiled. She drew closer. On the hilltop, Lyonette scooped up Mrsha. Erin smiled, tired, but—willing to try as she saw the young people so like her.
It wasn’t perfect. It was flawed. But today, at least—Erin smiled. If she was petty enough to turn away a stranger at the door, she wouldn’t have made it this far.
“I’m so proud of you. My little hero.”
Lyonette du Marquin whispered to the Gnoll. And Maviola drew Olesm closer as the flames engulfed her. But they burned no flesh or scale. Only spirit.
“They call me Maviola. Lady Firestarter. Look at me, you beautiful ember. Show me how you burn.”
She bent forwards. And kissed the Drake. She whispered.
“[A Little Bit of Courage].”
His eyes widened. And the spark lit.
Lyonette kissed Mrsha’s forehead.
“[Boon of the Princess].”
