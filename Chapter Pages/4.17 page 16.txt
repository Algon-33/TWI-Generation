Ivolethe floated up, smiling broadly. She tapped Ryoka in the chest, grinning and shaking her head.
 
“Showing off? That was the best time for it! You didn’t try. In that moment, ye were Ryoka at your most natural. You did not feel. You saw. And the wind saw you.”
 
“I did it?”
Ryoka stared at Ivolethe. She stared around, at where Fals was gingerly trying to do a handstand, at Garia, who was determinedly punching the air and Mrsha, doing flips as Wailant tossed her up and Viceria watched with a wand at the ready, just in case.
Then she looked at Ivolethe. To her surprise, there were tears in the faerie’s eyes.
“What’s wrong?”
The small Frost Faerie shook her head.
 
“Ah. I did not know. I did not know what else Humans came up with. I lived with a body like yours for years, but this?”
 
She did a corkscrew in the air, flipping over, a perfect copy of the move Ryoka had done. Ivolethe laughed.
 
“This! This is new. This is something else. And for this, Ryoka Griffin, I thank you. For showing me something I have never seen.”
 
She landed on the ground, and took a few steps. Ivolethe kicked up into the air and back flipped up past Ryoka, into the sky. Her laughter was all Ryoka heard. It filled the world as Ivolethe flipped upwards, not flying, but borne by the wind. Ryoka stared as the faerie flew and whispered one word.
“Grace.”
