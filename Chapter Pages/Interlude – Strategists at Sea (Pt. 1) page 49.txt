Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)
Page 49
“We found a…shipwreck. The very same ship charted by Archmage Zelkyr in the past. It’s guarded by a rather large crab and it’s quite—dangerous. There’s an active war golem inside. But I’m sure that there’s a bounty of treasure. If you wanted—as a reward for saving our lives—we could give you the locations.”
Wil carefully spoke. Rasea was just smiling at him.
“Well, that would be…wonderful indeed, Lord Kallinad. A crab, you said? And an Archmage’s treasure. That’d surely be an amazing haul. However—we couldn’t take that from you.”
She didn’t blink once. Wil’s heart sank.
“You…wouldn’t want to test yourselves against such a foe, Captain Rasea?”
“Well—it seems like a foe like that’d be very—dangerous. Especially war golems. With their fucking beams. I mean—whatever they do.”
Wil glanced over the side. He stared down the length of the Illuminary. And he noticed part of the hull looked…patched. He glanced back up at Rasea. She winked at him.
“Might not be the easiest catch, Lord Kallinad. You have any more…spots? We’d settle for—one.”
The [Lord]’s heart sank. He looked at Rasea. She might be a poor liar, but she could spell out her demands. And she had a simple trade. He hesitated.
Two spots left. He looked at Rasea. If it came to it or having to fight her—he’d make the trade. But he had one last attempt.
It was stupid. It was not going to work. But here be [Pirates]. So the [Lord] straightened. He stood at the railing, and gazed at the Illuminary’s crew.
Madmen. But not monsters, like some [Pirates]. He had seen Rasea laughing as she fought.
Adventure-seekers. So perhaps—
“Are you a romantic, Captain Rasea?”
“Who, me?”
The woman looked taken aback at the question. She blinked a few times.
“Well, I’ve teared up at a few stories. And I took to sea rather than maraud about on land. So you could say that. After all—I’m a [Pirate]. What’s more romantic than the sky and open sea, eh? Especially danger. Monsters. Treasure.”
She spread her arms. And her crew cheered. Wil nodded. He pitched his voice, looking her and her crew in the eye.
“Well, Captain. It occurs to me—that you could well speed me on my voyage. Were I and my friends to join you. But where would be the adventure in that?”
The [Pirate Captain] paused. She looked thoughtful.
“How do you mean?”
“This is our first adventure.”
Wil indicated his friends. They stood behind him. Venaz, Feshi, Yerranola, Merrik, and Peki. The [Lord] spoke on.
“We’re students of the Titan of Baleros. But this—this is the first adventure we’ve had. At sea. With a…map. Given to us by the Titan himself. Our first voyage, really.”
“Ah. Now that is a glorious moment. And has it been all you’ve dreamed of?”
The woman’s eyes lit up. Wil smiled, crookedly as she did with her sharp teeth on one side.
“Less. And more. Far less, sometimes. It was boring. But then—we saw something incredible. And it might be only the start. We sail to the House of Minos, to Izril. It might be the beginning of a story.”
The Illuminary were nodding. And Rasea’s eyes were shining. She envied him. The first experience. And Wil Kallinad looked at her.
“I’d like this adventure to be mine, Captain Rasea. I know it’s impertinent. But—could you see your way to leaving this adventure to me?”
She blinked at him. The crew stirred. Lasc looked at Wil as if he were insane.
“You want me to turn my ship and leave you to your adventure?”
“Well, otherwise it wouldn’t be much of one. Not with Captain Rasea the Shining, would it? And I’d like it to be something…memorable.”
