Something exploded. Ryoka saw a blast of fire, saw the splinter of wood. One of the servants coming in through the right door jerked. She saw a splinter of wood enter through the woman’s neck. She collapsed. Bekia whirled. She stared at the fallen maid. At Ryoka. Then someone tackled Ryoka.
“Down! We’re under attack!”
“Get them to the safe room!”
The Earthworlders were shouting in panic. The servants shot out of the room. Ryoka heard a shout. Screams. A roar.
“To the front! It’s not Ryoka! To arms!”
Whoever was on top of Ryoka let go. The City Runner rolled, getting to her feet. One ear was ringing. She stumbled past Rose and the others. And she saw—
The front of the mansion was gone. The gardens and walkway were on fire. Ryoka saw Bekia standing with the battleaxe gleaming in the sunlight. She was staring at a man. A silhouette, rather. Garbed entirely in black.
An [Assassin]. He stood behind ranks of black-clad figures, all wearing dark colors. Some wore dark armor, others bound cloth. A few had masks. One or two were even bareheaded.
Assassins. Ryoka’s breath caught. Where had they come from? Then the leader spoke.
“Strange. The Gnoll’s a high-value target. Miss Runner, you ran out of time.”
He nodded cheerfully at her. Ryoka recognized the voice. It was one of the loiterers who’d called out to her. He nodded at his companions.
“Ignore the City Runner. She’s not on our list. And the extras. Be professional about this or I will kill you.”
He pointed. Ryoka whirled. Rose and the other Earthworlders were stumbling out of the broken mansion, wide-eyed. Bekia turned her head.
“Get inside! Now!”
“Is this a joke? Oh my god, it’s like the other time at the mansion! They’re coming after us!”
Galina screamed. The [Assassin] looked at Bekia.
“We’re not here for the civilians. We’re here for you. Reinhart’s staff. You may surrender. The Guild of Assassins has marked Magnolia Reinhart’s—”
Thunk.
The [Assassin] blurred, dodging left. One of the black shapes folded up behind him. The leader tsked as Nerrissa lowered the crossbow.
“Fine. Go.”
The [Assassins] charged silently. Ryoka saw half of them throw something and dove.
“Down!”
The wind blew fiercely. It knocked the Earthworlders off their feet. Ryoka hit the ground, but most of the [Assassins] weren’t aiming at her. Ryoka got a kick as the group flailed, but she was on her feet.
She saw a full-scale battle behind her. The staff were fighting with the [Assassins], pulling back into the mansion. The leader beheaded a [Maid] and a [Butler] with his sword as Magnolia’s staff drew their own weapons. He leaned back as Bekia swung her axe. She halted mid-swing, brought the axe down.
“You filthy rats!”
The axe glowed. The magic in it exploded outwards. The lead [Assassin] cursed and vanished. The ones behind him weren’t so lucky. A scythe of gold cut through three. One spun away, grabbing at his arm. But he never made a sound.
“Fall back! Behind me!”
Bekia roared. The [Maid] swung her axe as if she wasn’t wearing a maid’s uniform. So quick—Ryoka saw her bisect a jumping [Assassin].
“Oh my god.”
Someone threw up behind her. Ryoka turned. The Earthworlders were staring at the violence.
“Get to cover!”
Ryoka snapped. She grabbed Rose and pushed them. Imani was already inside. Ryoka saw more staff flood down the steps. She stared. These servants were armed.
