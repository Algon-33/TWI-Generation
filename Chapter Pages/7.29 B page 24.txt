“They probably think it’s another world power. Or damn aliens. Who suspects magic?”
“They should be able to detect it! Isn’t anyone looking? The FBI—”
“Two thousand people go missing every day.”
“On security footage? Bullshit! Shut up, I’ll kill you—”
“Silence!”
Aaron shouted. Elena looked at him. The others calmed down. Aaron wished Telim had given him some more calming potions. He needed them.
“That’s all Erik knows. Don’t bother him. And don’t tell the others. There’s nothing we can do. Unless we get access to a way to communicate with Earth—we can do nothing.”
“But we have to tell them we’re here. Alive.”
Haley whispered. The others nodded. They looked at Aaron.
“Blackmage. Can you hack the phones? We’ve got computers. Other electronics.”
Aaron Vanwell felt the pressure of so many expectations. He shook his head, his shoulders slumping.
“I’ve tried. All I can do is create a fake network. There’s a resonance between phones. I hijacked that to talk to everyone the first time. I can do it again—Wistram is trying to boost the signal. But there’s nothing from home.”
Because they were in another world. You could expand the signal to go thousands of miles. But how could you make it cross dimensions? Or whatever separated them? Aaron had to believe—the answer lay at a higher level.
“We’re trying. For now, we’ll meet up again. Remember, keep it secret. Don’t tell anyone with loose lips. No [Mages] know about this. We’re in this together. We’re not in different factions. We’re from Earth.”
Elena went around the room, and the others nodded. Some were doubtful; perhaps the word would get out. But they had to try.
“Aaron, you said you had one last thing to bring up. What is that?”
Jacques looked at Aaron. The [Engineer] took a deep breath.
“I’m—there might be one ally in Wistram. At least, someone we can trust. He helped me find this room. I’ve been asking around, but I can’t find a trace of him. If any of you sees him—let me know.”
“Who is it? A [Mage]?”
“No. I think he’s a ghost. Of an Archmage.”
The others fell silent. Elena’s eyes narrowed slowly.
“You didn’t tell me that, Aaron. When did you meet him?”
“During the winter.”
A few of the others looked up slowly. Haley leaned forwards.
“I haven’t seen ghosts. And I’ve seen a lot of weird things. But no talking paintings or ghosts. Yet. [Necromancers] are banned in Wistram, or so I hear.”
“Yeah. That might be why he’s hiding. But if you meet him—you’ll know.”
A few raised eyebrows. Shun raised one hand.
“What’s his name?”
Blackmage glanced up. He spoke the name.
“Emerrhain.”
The others looked blank. They promised to look out for him. Or check the history books. But that was the funny thing. Aaron was aware that even Wistram’s history books didn’t go back beyond the tens of thousands of years at most. But he’d searched for all this time. And he’d never seen the man’s name before. But he’d known about the secret study and this place.
So what else could he be? Elena stared at Aaron’s face as the others began to leave the room. And she shivered.

Those were the things Earthers did. Plot in secret, have fun, work on their projects, and study magic or their passions. What else were they to do?
In a way, they were doing what all [Mages] did at Wistram. And if they weren’t allowed to leave—they were treated well. Elena wanted to leave.
But she was a minority. The others would love to leave, to see the wondrous sights or have an adventure—but only for a while. Wistram, as a place to live, was rather fine.
