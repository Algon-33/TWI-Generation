Then they were facing the waving [Bandit Lady], the desperate battle around Pomle as Nerrhavia’s Fallen struggled to withdraw and Savere and Illivere began to fall back, one with a Golem in tow. Pisces was waving at Merr.
“We have to protect them from Roshal! We have to defeat Nerrhavia’s Fallen.”
He turned to the others, and Yvlon shook her head.
“No—I need to talk to Yisame. We might be able to get them to withdraw.”
She wasn’t sure how likely that was, but Ceria took one look at the screaming [Siren] and hesitated.
“I, uh—I don’t think Revine’s going to forgive me.”
Ksmvr lifted all three arms.
“And I would like my sword back! I wish to clarify, I only loaned it to Empress Nsiia. I believe we are owed interest.”
Every eye was on them, from the horrified courts of Nerrhavia’s Fallen to secret fans of the team to the enraged Roshal [Slavers] to Pisces’ comrades. Even Savere had to admire Ceria as they shot towards the waiting [Martial Artists].
“Now there’s a Gold-rank team. Crazy as loons.”
Salii muttered as the stolen chariot screamed towards their lines. Then she looked up.
“Ancestors.”

“Yvlon! Stop! Don’t do this!”
Prince Zenol was racing after Yvlon. She could not take up arms with Tiqr! Everything else could be excused, no matter how angry Thelican was, but for her sake—Queen Yisame’s—
He had only one shot. The [Prince] raced clear of the fighting, ignoring Tiqr’s soldiers coming for him. He tensed—
And [Like a Lion, He Leapt]. Scimitar blazing with magic.
The four adventurers saw him. One of them turned and saw the [Prince] coming in what could only be described as a hostile maneuver. The Antinium whirled with two shining blades—and jumped.
His team turned to follow him, and every head craned up as Zenol and Ksmvr locked gazes. The [Prince] hesitated in that moment.
Was he going to…? Ksmvr had joined Tiqr. The Antinium was staring at him. They were on different sides.
But they had fought together. Zenol’s blade felt like it was wavering in his hands. The Antinium’s swords flashed uncertainly. They were on a collision course, and Zenol uttered the only prayer he knew.
“Nerrhavia’s bones guide me…”
He raised the sword as Ksmvr’s blades flashed. A boot kicked Zenol out of the air.
“What—”
The [Prince] fell, shouting, as Ksmvr twisted too late. He tried to cut at the figure on the carpet, but the masked rider just laughed and caught the blade. The other Revenant piloting the flying carpet watched Zenol fall.
“Got one. Coutei—where are our targets?”
“Below! Strike whatever armies they are! In the name of Khelt!”
Ksmvr, struggling in the impossibly strong grip, stared as undead Revenants, three, each on a flying carpet, dove through the air. The last, a passenger, casually put Ksmvr in a headlock.
“Don’t fight, strange whatever-you-are! By Eternal Khelt—stand aside or die!”
Of course, the bewildered forces had no idea who the undead were. Indeed, the sight of undead on carpets? Every bow went up in Nerrhavia’s army below.
That was their mistake. One rider peeled off instantly. The Scourgeriders of Emrist swept down. One targeted the chariot and three adventurers. The other two blasted over the [Soldiers]. One raised a bag.
“[Create Cloud: Paralysis Dust]!”
A cloud of yellow particles swept behind the undead in its wake. The other was less merciful.
“[Fireball]. [Fireball]. [Fireball]. [Fireball]. [Fireball]. [Fireball]. [Fireball]—”
