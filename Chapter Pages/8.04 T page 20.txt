The last Empress of Harpies, Sheta, fell. And all that she had built fell to ruin.
The first and only [Dragonprince] died, he who had charmed them and given even them something to believe in.
Gone. 
The old Dragon had seen it. Heard it all, so many times.
There they were. Bright stars, beautiful souls, blazing bright. Fading in moments. Gone—gone—taken in a moment. An accident. A blade in the dark.
He thought he had seen it all. And still, they surprised him as they died. Still, it tore a piece of him away, as if there had been barbs.
Suddenly, all the little joys and petty annoyances were gone. The half-Elf uncurled by fractions.
…He was Teriarch again. In this moment. And he wanted to be back in his cave. To sleep, and not wake until all that he had known was changed again.
He listened to a familiar sound. Sobbing.
The young woman was crying, pleading with him. Begging and offering trinkets from another world. Knowledge.
She thought he was gone. Slowly, he bent and picked up the little stone.
“Child. I’m here. Speak to me.”
The old man sat there, on the bed. And he listened. He listened to how the [Innkeeper] had—

“Checkmate, I think.”
She smiled at him during the third game. Not a smirk, but a small, pleased smile. She couldn’t help it. Nor was she gloating, not really.
It was such a genuine smile, of someone truly pleased with herself, that he couldn’t be mad. Well, for a moment. Then he’d tossed the board.
But he’d gone to her later, and looked at her again, even as she made comments about being a bad sport. And she knew more of him then. And he knew her.
He remembered her name and face. For here was someone who had bested a Dragon.

Erin Solstice. Eldavin’s head rose suddenly.
“Say that again.”
“She’s not…dead.”
“How?”
“We froze her. Listen, listen, please…”
He did, with heart pounding. And it changed again. In his mind, he saw a broken body. A great warrior-queen, laid low. Preserved by a grieving [Archmage] who called for someone to heal her.
A Dragon who knelt after slaying the greatest filth Crelers had ever wrought. Her kin, who labored to save her…
“Alive. No. Neither alive nor dead. You are sure?”
“I haven’t…haven’t seen her. But I know what they did.”
“Freezing. Why ice? She’s no [Cryomancer] or Ice Dragon…”
Yet there was a kind of logic there. Teriarch listened, mixing analytical disbelief with hope and…
“The fae think she’s alive. Or she can be healed. Ivolethe was trying to help me, before…and [Detect Death] and [Detect Life] both don’t work!”
“That does not mean she is safe. Is she warded? Against ghosts?”
“I…I don’t know? I’ll ask.”
Teriarch thought.
“If she lies in the [Garden of Sanctuary], she is. And this news…you met with him. You travelled to another world. You met with the King of Chivalry?”
“I have his autograph.”
Eldavin sprayed the mana potion across the room. He stared; he’d been running low on mana and had to sip one of those odious things. He stared, affronted, as mana potion ran from his nose.
Bodies!
“Please, Eldavin. Help her. Help me. I have…other things. Whatever you want.”
“You know what I have said, girl.”
Yet…that was just automatic. He was thinking. Ryoka gulped loudly and wetly.
“I do. But please? I can’t…I did my best. And I…”
“Hush. Before I speak on that, say it again. What did you say before that?”
Another gulp.
“They’re back. I…Laken got a text. He’s like me. Haven’t you seen…?”
“I am not close to that—device. You saw it? And…describe the meeting with the fae again.”
She did. And now Teriarch conceived a mortal horror the like of which he had not felt since the Creler wars.
