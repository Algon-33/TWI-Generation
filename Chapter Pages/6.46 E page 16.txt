“Perhaps you remember them. But fewer still could put out a fire today.”
Califor’s voice was sharp. Tired. Belavierr paused, and then nodded.
“My daughter remains. She refused to leave.”
Nanette’s breath caught. She looked at Miss Califor. The older [Witch] bowed her head.
“Stubborn girl. She made her choice.”
Belavierr’s gaze didn’t waver.
“Yes. And I have yet to make mine. Tell me, Witch Califor. Do you know of a way to stem the fire? I can think of only one way.”
Miss Califor paused and nodded.
“I know of the same way myself. But the cost is not one I would pay. Nor do I think you wish to pay it. But it is possible.”
“Yes.”
Belavierr whispered the words. She looked back. And Nanette saw she was afraid. Her eyes turned back and Nanette stared into that ringed, orange gaze. Belavierr paused.
“She is my daughter. But the choice is mine.”
“That is every [Witch]’s decision. I would not fault you either way. To protect Nanette, I abandoned the coven. I would do it again.”
Miss Califor’s voice was quiet. Belavierr nodded. She hesitated, and then she reached out. She and Califor both stared at the extended hand.
“Witch Califor. I bid thee farewell. If I meet other [Witches], I will speak your name to them.”
Nanette’s eyes widened. Califor stared at the hand. And then, slowly, she reached out and shook it.
“Witch Belavierr. I bid thee farewell also. If I should meet other [Witches], I will speak your name to them. Farewell.”
Belavierr nodded. She rode past Califor. And she looked at Nanette.
“Witch Nanette. Farewell. I have a choice to make.”
“I—I bid thee farewell, Witch Belavierr. If I should meet other [Witches]—”
Nanette choked on her reply as she took the hat from her head. Belavierr’s eyes were so very afraid. The Stitch Witch paused, waiting. Nanette only cried. Belavierr paused. Her eyes focused on Nanette. She put her hand on Nanette’s head. Patted it once.
“Once, Wiskeria was as small as you. I remember those days.”
She waited as Nanette put her hat on her head. And then she turned. She looked old and tired as she sat on the saddle. But she straightened. And the Stitch Witch, Belavierr, looked back at the fire. It blazed behind the three [Witches]. Belavierr sighed. And she turned and nodded at Miss Califor.
“For my daughter, Witch Califor. I might do anything.”
Califor only nodded in reply. Belavierr tipped her hat. And then, slowly, she kicked her horse. It trotted forwards. The wrong way. Belavierr rode towards the smoke. Towards the fire Nanette and Califor had left. She didn’t hear Nanette shouting at her.
“Nanette. Let her go.”
Miss Califor watched Belavierr’s back. The Stitch Witch sat straight, head bowed. She rode back through the flames. Califor and Nanette watched her go. And Nanette saw Miss Califor sigh. The [Witch] turned and jerked her head.
“Come, Nanette. We must keep moving.”
She strode forwards, leading the horse carrying Nanette across the burned land. Miss Califor kept her gaze ahead as her apprentice kept crying. She only looked back once.

Ryoka saw it burning ahead of her. So much fire that it didn’t seem real. It looked like the entire world was on fire. It was like staring at hell. A vision of it.
She was afraid. Terrified. The wind wasn’t coming to her aid. It was shackled. Forced to blow against its will. But fire and pressure had created that tornado. And now it raged, hurtling towards Riverfarm. Ryoka had struggled to stop strong breezes. How could she stop this?
