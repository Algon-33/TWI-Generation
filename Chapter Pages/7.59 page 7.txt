Some of them were uncomprehending. But some of them who’d been with her looked up sharply. Cara focused on the orb in Abebi’s hands. She let one of the [Clothiers] present her with a selection of outfits.
“That one. Hurry up. Just cover any mistakes. And—let me think.”
“Song?”
Thien looked at her sharply. Rae was still uncomprehending. Cara bit her lip.
“Something action-packed. Just find one. It’s not the song that matters. I’m trying to…if I were closer, I could summon aid. But…”
“You’re going to sing? But Cara, they’re a continent away! Even the [Strategists] were saying—”
Cara looked at Rae. She snorted.
“There’s nowhere my voice can’t reach. Tell Aaron I need a favor.”

Someone started playing a song out of the scrying orb. Ryoka saw Saliss twist.
“Ancestor’s tails, what—”

The Singer of Terandria appeared on the screen, in a corner of the broadcast. Erin nearly broke the glass.
“What? What? This isn’t the time for—”
“This one goes out to the Wind Runner of Reizmelt, the [Alchemist] of Pallass, Lady El and whoever believes in doing the right thing!”
The Popstar of Terandria began to sing. Erin’s jaw dropped. She saw Drassi and Sir Relz reacting, asking furious questions—no one had told them either! But then—

Ryoka sped up. She felt her body, shaking with nervous adrenaline and the potions, relax. Something like actual rest replaced the magic and alchemy. Maviola’s flagging mare perked her head up and snorted.
“What the—”
“That’s a [Singer]’s Skills.”
Saliss looked at the orb. Then he grinned. The [Assassins] behind them were covering their ears. Ryoka heard a pop song—was it that loud and objectionable?

[Banshee’s Voice]. [Melody of Speed]. [Song of Rejuvenation]—
Cara sang.

“Let’s go!”
Saliss leapt off Maviola’s back. They were coming down the road, the three forced back. He raised a potion and lobbed it ahead of him.
“Damn, I need to ration these—”
The Potion of Firespark Blast flew through the air. Ryoka saw it flying ahead as the group of oncoming [Riders] split into two. They knew how to dodge the [Alchemist] by now. The potion curved, trying to tag the left group—but too slowly.
Then it split in midair. Two potions landed. Ryoka flinched as two fiery explosions laced with sparks obliterated the leftmost group. The other group of [Assassins] instantly peeled back.
“What the—”
She stared at Saliss. He could duplicate his potions? The Drake was staring at his own throw with wide eyes. Then he looked up.
“The Old Man.”
She didn’t know what he meant at first. Saliss strode forwards. Suddenly—he was lobbing potions fast. They split in midair, curving with unnatural speed. And he was moving like—
 
—-
 
“[Army: Duplicate Projectiles]. [Path to Victory]. [Battalion: Arcs of the Swallow].”
Chaldion of Pallass’ eye glowed. He sat in the war room, alone. He had dismissed the lesser [Strategists], the [Generals].
His Skill did not affect the other two. One was a [Lady]. The other…an entry on Grimalkin’s lists. But the last was his family.
Saliss. And he would not die here. The [Strategist] was watching the projection. The [Singer]’s voice, which was like a shriek to the [Assassins], was aiding the three. Her voice could reach around the world so long as there was Wistram to send it.
Clever. Was it enough? Chaldion was using an hourglass, managing his Skills. Saliss had taken advantage of the increase in his already nigh-unstoppable firepower. The [Assassins] had backed off.
