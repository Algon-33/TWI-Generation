Cara didn’t reply at first. Wearily, she passed a hand over her face. Smearing the makeup.
“Abebi. You’ve known me longest. So I’m going to tell you this. Once. All of this is a mask.”
She pointed at her face.
“Mask. And below that’s another mask. Because we’re not safe. I pretend to be the flashy Singer of Terandria because we need money. The others need it to live, I need it to buy artifacts, that replacement inhaler for Desmond—we need money. And that’s why we’re touring.”
“To find the best place to settle. I know.”
Abebi nodded. Cara did too.
“Terandria’s safest. So it seems. But no kingdom’s perfect. And nowhere is safe. We’re being…hunted. We need allies. Those [Knights]? Maybe we can trust them. We need to trust someone. Because I’m just a [Pop Star]. I can’t protect us if push comes to shove.”
“But you’re the highest-leveled among us! By far! You’re Level 40.”
Cara had hit that level last month. The [Singer] smiled crookedly.
“So what? Abebi. You think if Wistram tries to arrest us, we’ll get away?”
“The audience loves you! Can’t you hear them out there? A [Prince] wants to marry you!”
“Fuck him. Our fans will turn on us. I’m a celebrity, Abebi. A star. I shine—and then I’m forgotten in a year or two. We make the money we can, find good allies. Maybe Ailendamus. We back the winning horse. But we need help. Do you think I can stop a nation? Tell me—when has a celebrity changed anything?”
She sat there, smiling cynically at Abebi. The [Manager] hesitated.
“Are you sure? You’ve been so worried—why not go with those Wistram [Mages]? That Blackmage person?”
Cara grimaced.
“I got a letter back from Elena the other day. Want to see it?”
“You did? Why didn’t you tell us?”
Abebi eagerly took the letter. It was from Elena! She had volunteered to go to Wistram. Abebi read through it. It was filled with talk of Wistram. Aaron and the magical experiments—encouraging the others to join her. Her face—froze. Abebi looked up from the letter.
“It—this is from Elena, right?”
“Yup. And we have some of those [Mages] following us. Keep asking to speak to me, to escort us to Wistram. All nine of us. Which means Elena hasn’t told them about the others. Good thing we switched the hiding place, right?”
The [Thespian] leaned back, sighing. Abebi read the letter again.
“She didn’t use any of the passphrases we came up with.”
“No shit?”
Cara covered her face. Elena had been given a number of innocuous expressions she’d work into correspondence if everything was okay. That they weren’t there meant it wasn’t. The [Singer] spoke bitterly.
“It’s a trap. I knew it. They’re probably keeping her hostage. She can’t leave. Fuck those Illuminati-[Mage] cunts and their academy. And thanks to that jackass—blackmage—they’re onto us. Don’t share that, Abebi. I’ll tell the others after this tour.”
The Nigerian [Manager] nodded palely. She put the letter down, hands shaking. Cara went on.
“It’s Plan C or Plan G. We have to get with someone who’ll back us. Who can resist Wistram and…that’s all. That’s why we’re doing this. That’s why the masks. Abebi. You all don’t even know my real name.”
She looked at Abebi. The smiling [Singer], the bitter pragmatist—which one was real? Abebi looked at Cara.
“It’s not Cara O’Sullivan?”
For a second, the [Actor] stared at her. And Abebi saw her face, blankly staring. Unmoving. Then the [Thespian] smiled.
“Of course it is. That part’s a lie. Come on. I want to see if one of those [Knights] stuck around.”
