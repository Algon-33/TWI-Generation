Erin came to the first door in the hallway and rapped softly on the door. Pawn listened. He couldn’t hear much from inside, but at Erin’s knock he heard a quiet shuffling. It wasn’t Lyonette who opened the door, but Mrsha. The Gnoll cub stood clumsily on two legs as she pulled the door open.
“Hey Mrsha. Hey Lyonette. Sorry to bug you.”
The [Innkeeper] called cautiously into the room as Pawn tried to look over her shoulder. He couldn’t see past her. Erin stepped into the room as Mrsha stared up at Pawn. He stared back and waved one of his hands at her. The Gnoll didn’t wave back.
“No, don’t get up Lyonette. I didn’t want to bug you but Pawn’s here and he’s worried. You don’t have to—it’s okay? Okay, Pawn? Come on in.”
Hesitantly, Pawn stepped into the room as Mrsha dropped onto all fours and padded back inside. She crept up next to a young woman sitting with a blanket around her shoulders. Lyonette’s eyes were red and she was holding a wet handkerchief. She looked up at Pawn and tried to smile.
“Hi Pawn.”
“Good morning, Lyonette. I am terribly sorry to bother you. I was worried when I heard you were upset.”
“Thank you, Pawn.”
Erin stood up. She looked at Pawn and Lyonette, wavering.
“I have to get back to work. Lyonette, are you okay?”
The younger girl gave Erin a watery smile.
“I’m fine, Erin. Don’t worry about me, please. I know you have a lot to do.”
“Okay. Pawn? If you want to talk I’ll be in the kitchen later.”
Pawn nodded distractedly as Erin left. He kept staring at Lyonette. She was still crying. Tears ran from the sides of her eyes and she kept dabbing at them. Mrsha curled up next to her. Pawn had no idea what to say. At last, he tried to speak.
“I am sorry to bother you, Lyonette. I could come back later if you do not wish to talk.”
“It’s fine, Pawn. I didn’t want to make you worry. I’m just—having a bad day, that’s all.”
“Oh.”
What a wholly unsatisfactory response. Pawn searched for good words and found none. He almost regretted coming upstairs, to be honest. What could he say? He shouldn’t have bothered her. And yet—it was Lyonette. His friend. Was she his friend? He thought she must be.
She had been there when he first started to lead the Soldiers. She had taught him how to act, how to stand tall. She had fed them. And now she was crying and he had no idea why. He hadn’t known. That made Pawn’s chest hurt.
“May I ask why you are upset?”
Lyonette sniffed. She looked away.
“It’s…personal.”
“Oh. I see.”
Crestfallen, the Worker looked down at his feet. He was still wet. He should go. But he didn’t move. After a moment Lyonette looked up at him and sniffed again.
“It’s not that I don’t want to say. It’s just—it shouldn’t matter but it does. I lost it, Pawn.”
“Lost? What?”
“My class.”
Tears trickled down Lyonette’s cheeks. Pawn stared at her. She couldn’t mean her [Barmaid] class. If she was crying, then—
“You lost your [Princess] class?”
Lyonette nodded. Pawn was stunned.
“How?”
The young woman shook her head.
“I must have stopped being a princess. At last. I should have known it would happen. I work at an inn as a [Barmaid]. I’m far from my kingdom. I—I should have known. And it shouldn’t matter.”
She sniffed and Mrsha reached up to pat her leg. Lyonette gently stroked Mrsha’s head. Pawn felt like an outsider. He should not be here. And he had no idea what to say. She had lost her class.
“You should have it back. I will pray for your class to return.”
Lyonette blinked. She stared at Pawn and then laughed. It was a weak sound and there was nothing funny in the way she laughed.
“What? No. Don’t do that. It’s fine, Pawn.”
