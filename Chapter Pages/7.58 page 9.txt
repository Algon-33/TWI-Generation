When the [Princess] sat down, she was calmer. She looked at Ryoka. Lyonette composed her breathing, checked herself. When Ryoka looked up, the [Princess] spoke slowly.
“When we first met—truly met, not me being an ungrateful child after Erin rescued me—I liked you. I hated Erin, at the time. Remember? With Maran and Safry?”
“I remember.”
“You listened to me—you discovered a [Princess]. You were kind. I liked you. But then you left.”
“After Regrika.”
“Yes. And—you left Mrsha behind.”
“I—”
“You were looking for Erin. But you left her behind after Regrika. I know Ivolethe died. But you still left. And you didn’t write until months had gone by. We wondered if you were dead.”
Ryoka hung her head. Lyonette pointed towards the door Mrsha had gone through.
“Do you know how many nights she cried for you? For you, the person who’d rescued her. And you were gone. I hated you for that.”
So did Ryoka. She shrank in her seat. Lyonette regarded her, and then went on.
“But then you came back. I was jealous because Mrsha loved you. She’s my daughter, you understand? I was jealous and that wasn’t fair.”
“No. It’s—Erin told me of what you’ve done. You deserve to call yourself her mother. You are, I mean.”
The [Princess] nodded.
“That’s not why I hate you. Not all of it. It’s a lot of things, honestly. Part of it is jealousy, I can admit that. But part of it—you run here, you run there, but whenever you come to the inn, you just dump your troubles on us. First Mrsha—but then the Earthers. Then you run off. And you’re so—so arrogant. You act like you’re the only person who thinks about the future, but you’re terrible at committing to a plan. Like with Xrn.”
Barbs and needles and thorns in her skin. Ryoka waited. Lyonette was unloading all the things she hadn’t said before. The [Princess] exhaled.
“Even then. I could look past all of that. But you’re just so damned selfish. You don’t get to run off and risk your life whenever you feel like it. You have people who depend on you. You have a responsibility.”
She pointed at the door, at where Mrsha had been. Ryoka looked up at her. Lyonette’s finger began to shake. The [Princess] gulped down another breath.
“I’m not saying you’re wrong. You saved Mrsha. And you woke the Archmage of Izril—you’ve done amazing things. No one could deny that. But—I don’t want Mrsha to love you anymore.”
She sniffed. The [Princess]’s eyes were filling up. She looked at Ryoka.
“I wish she didn’t love you. I wish you’d never come back and she grieved and cried but forgot about you. Because someday, someone is going to have to tell her that you’re dead. It won’t be decades from now. It might not even be years. And that person will be me, or Erin.”
The Wind Runner’s stomach dropped. Her body felt cold. Lyonette was wiping at her eyes.
“It could be tomorrow. You care about everyone. Everyone but yourself. You’re going to die on one of these runs and I don’t know what will happen to Mrsha. Why do you have to do this?”
Ryoka wiped her eyes. They were stinging. So that—
“I didn’t think of that.”
“I know. But we do. Mrsha does. I do. Erin does—the inn is dangerous enough. But that’s not like this. This—you don’t have to do this. This isn’t a monster coming after us. This is your choice. Please don’t do this. Why do you feel like you have to?”
She’d said her piece. And Ryoka got it, now. Lyonette’s furious despair over…Ryoka. Someone who was there, and not. A lovely aunt for Mrsha, a friend, a good person to have—
Until she was dead. And Ryoka had seen death too many times. Valeterisa’s mansion? The High Passes? She danced with it. She…
