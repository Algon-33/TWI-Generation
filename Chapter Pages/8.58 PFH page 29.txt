She lifted her wand. A pillar of earth like a battering ram punched out of the air and towards her head. How did she do it that fast? Ceria Springwalker looked up—
And the pillar punched through her body. She stood there, then threw up her hands.
“Oh no. You got me!”
The [Captain] blinked at her. Then whirled.
An [Ice Lance] hit her barrier and knocked her backwards. She caught herself—aimed around.
“She’s damned invisible, [Captain]!”
A [Pirate] called out. The Selphid snarled.
“I don’t need your help, you idiots! I—”
She hesitated, looked around, and spat.
“So that’s what that fucking thing does.”
Ceria peeked around one of her [Ice Walls]. She also poked her head over a little ridge of ice. A third Ceria stood in the open, aiming her wand at the [Captain].
Illusions. One shot an [Ice Spike] and the [Captain] dodged—and the [Ice Spike] passed straight through one of the [Pirates], who recoiled with a yell. Another [Mage] looked at the Cerias, wide-eyed.
“I can’t tell which ones are fake!”
Illusion magic. Her circlet was shining. The [Captain] whirled, blasting at the Cerias—a wall of ice rose, ten feet tall, and then tried to fall on top of her. The Selphid kicked off it with an oath—she flew through the air.
Rampaging. Strong and able to cast [Earthen Pillar] and throw it around. She turned around, laughing.
“Is this the circlet or you? Come on, Gold-rank! Show me what you have! Is that your best spell?”
She raised her own wall of stone and an [Ice Lance] shattered on it. Her magic punched through an Frost Elemental and one of Ceria’s walls.
She had the magic Ceria did not. They were both Tier 4 spells. But one of them had been at that level longer, figured out how to make it stronger.
If Pisces were here, Ceria would have been able to let him support her with [Invisibility] spells. Yvlon could have taken the [Captain] in a straight fight, and Ksmvr was fast enough to dodge those things.
“I miss my team.”
The Ceria Springwalker standing in the open sighed. The other two Cerias not dead flickered out of existence.
The [Pirate Mage-Captain] spun warily to face Ceria.
“Out of tricks already? That circlet’s not that impressive. Or is it you?”
Ceria idly tapped it. The [Captain] looked around, expecting a trick. Which she was wise to. Ceria lifted it up and admired it.
“It’s true. I can’t make full use of it. Not yet. It even had to feed me mana so I could cast all those spells. It doesn’t have infinite magic. And I don’t have any Tier 5 spells or boosters. Yet. I’ll work on it. Good lesson.”
The Bloodtear Captain eyed her.
“You think you’ll get out of here?”
Ceria Springwalker smiled. She glanced up and to the side for a second.
“I think so. Ready? Take your best shot, if you dare.”
She aimed her wand at the [Captain]. The Selphid hesitated. She linked the magic in her mind. The largest [Earth Pillar] yet appeared in the air over Ceria’s head. It hammered the ground—but she was skating away.
Straight into a wall of earth. Ceria whirled in shock—as if she was the only person who could control a battlefield. Two shackles of earth leapt from the ground and grabbed around her ankles. She lurched. And the final [Earth Pillar] shot from the wand.

“Ereiyne!”
Captain Aldrail roared. He charged through the watching [Pirates] with Jiupe and another [Captain]. Too late. They saw the [Earth Pillar] fire. Captain Ereiyne’s signature move, which could crack the decks of unenchanted ships.
It struck home. The thunderous roar of ice and stone and bone filled the air. Aldrail watched, throwing up his paws to block shrapnel.
Wait.
