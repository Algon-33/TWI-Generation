Typhenous was still waking up. The old [Mage] had white hair and a beard, but he moved surprisingly quickly for someone his age. The two boys in the family’s wagon stared as Typhenous unsheathed a wicked dagger as he lifted his staff.
“You missed it, old man. We’re attacking them. They’re looking this way, Halrac.”
Revi warned the leader of Griffon Hunt. Halrac shrugged.
“What do they see?”
He paused as he lowered his bow. From afar he looked unarmed. And the [Raiders] indeed looked straight past him—until he raised his bow and shot another through the nose. As in—straight through the bridge of the nose and the rest of the woman’s head.
“Ah! Dead gods, Halrac!”
Revi recoiled from the sight. The [Raiders] stared as Halrac aimed again.
“Cover me if they charge, Revi. Typhenous, shields up.”
“Is this an attack? I missed the beginning. [Force Wall]. Just below your chin, Halrac.”
“Got it.”
The shimmering barrier appeared as Typhenous cast his spell. The [Raiders] were debating charging or fleeing the threat. But Halrac kept loosing arrows.
Some of them charged. The rest fled. But their arrows and spells hit the [Force Wall]. The barrier was mostly invisible as well, and did indeed cover the entire frightened family in the wagon and Halrac—just up to his chin. He shot over the magical barrier. Revi lifted her wand—but never cast a single spell.
The [Raiders] died on that busy road. The horses, terrified, galloped around until they were captured. And the patrol of Invrisil’s Watch arrived too late.
They’d arrived quickly. Fifteen minutes and they were out on the trade road in force. But they just found the dead [Raiders], a bunch of lined-up horses being shepherded together by glowing, summoned warriors.
And Griffon Hunt. Lacel the Leaper had run on without so much as pausing. But the Gold-rank adventurers were taking their dues.
Applause. And the [Raider]’s horses and gear. Halrac paused in prying the [Raid Leader]’s mace out of her stiff hands as the [Sergeant] on horseback waved at him.
“Excuse me! Are you an adventurer?”
“That’s right. Halrac…Captain of Griffon Hunt.”
The [Scout] paused a second as he gave his title. The [Sergeant] relaxed.
“Well then, you’ve done us a favor. Thank you, sir. Did you see what those [Bandits] were after?”
“Not [Bandits], [Raiders].”
Typhenous corrected the [Sergeant]. He casually yanked a gold tooth out of an open mouth. The [Guards] winced. So did Revi, who was helping.
“Typhenous!”
“It’s gold, Revi. Be a dear and help me with the bag of holding? [Raiders], indeed. You can tell by their armor and style. Bandits operate from a base. [Raiders] are hit-and-run—aha. Another tooth. Silver. Revi, stop fidgeting.”
The [Sergeant] stared as Typhenous bent over the corpse. But that was adventurers for you. He cleared his throat and noticed Revi’s summoned warriors herding the horses together.
“Adventurer Halrac, er, can I assume your team is claiming salvage rights on the [Raiders]?”
“That’s right. We can dispose of the bodies as well.”
“Ah, well then.”
The Watch brightened a bit. So did the [Sergeant].
This was protocol. It might have been alien to the travellers staring as the Gold-rank adventurers, er…looted the dead, but the Watch and the adventurers were used to it.
Salvage rights for the criminal’s possessions. Griffon Hunt was entitled to it, but that meant also disposing of corpses, or paying the Watch for a fee. If you just looted the bodies and left them to rot, well, you could be fined for it. You could get away with that around Celum, maybe.
