Wall Lord Ilvriss sat and listened. And for a moment, something dark overshadowed even his foe. Even the Antinium rustled, wondering.
And Rhir? The survivors of 5th Wall lived another day. It was easy to say it hadn’t mattered. But that would have trivialized the life and death of everyone who had fallen. Merish closed his eyes as sleep took him. Viri slept, weeping. Shellc closed his eye, vowing to return.
Then…they too went home.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: It was another arc planned in advance. And it was delayed many times. But it’s been written. I…wonder if it’s the first tragedy that I’ve streamed live?
I hope I did it justice, but even with my best chapters, the amount of doubt you tend to get is immense. Because chapters like this deserve all the polish and time in the world. And as a web serial, I don’t have enough.
That’s the flaw of the medium. But we continue onwards. It’s not over. If Rhir is one part of the story, well, it’s a necessary part to me. Not always enjoyable. But The Wandering Inn is made of many perspectives. And the whole is what matters.
I am taking a break for a week. I’ll be back on the 28th, as I mentioned at the top. It’s necessary to keep writing, so I hope you’ll bear with me. Look forwards to that, and thanks for reading!
