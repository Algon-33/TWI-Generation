The Twisted Queen sat in her laboratory. A vast chamber. She was not as large as Anand had assumed. She had volunteered for the experiments that had damaged the Armored Queen so. But they had taken such a toll that she hadn’t been able to birth more Antinium, so her size had remained smaller than the Flying Queen, Grand Queen, and Armored Queen.
Thusly, the chamber was large enough for her to move about. Vast—and the Birther pods sat around her. Incubating things that moved in the liquid. The living products sat there. Watching them.
“Twisted Queen. Your greeting was unwelcome.”
Klbkch was fearless. The Slayer walked up to the broken Queen. Anand and the Free Antinium just held each other in horror.
They had beheld their Free Queen, who was still their Queen, and the other Queens before. But this Queen—was broken. If the Armored Queen was broken in spirit, the Twisted Queen had endured the privations of the body.
One of her large mandibles was missing. Torn off. Parts of her body were…gone. As if something had eaten away at her. She had only one eye. She moved, spoke, jerkily.
“Klbkch. Hezeim. Apologies. Did not know you. Were coming. Wrymvr greeted. You. Our welcomes.”
The Centenium nodded slowly as Wrymvr waited in a corner of the room.
“I have visited every other Hive, my Queen. And found much to appreciate and much to improve.”
“Yes. You would. Other Queens. Projects. I. I. Wrymvr. Different. Plans, what are these? Your Individuals?”
“Yes. Anand, step forwards. This is Anand, my [Strategist]. The highest-leveled Antinium suitable to the Antinium’s ends. He is the achievement of the Free Antinium—”
Klbkch got no further. The Twisted Queen was missing limbs. But she still had her long feelers. She reached down and picked Anand up.
“Revalantor!”
The Queen lifted Anand into the air, holding him in front of her. She regarded him.
“Ah. Then. Let me see what. Makes him different.”
Her grip tightened. She lowered Anand towards one of the empty sacs. A creation pod. A Birther.
“Twisted Queen. What are you doing?”
Klbkch had reacted to the sudden motion by striding forwards. Now, the Twisted Queen replied.
“To see is. To unmake. I will see what changes. His mind. Has made.”
Anand stared at her. Then he began to wriggle, heedless of the fall.
“No, no—I do not want to—”
He looked down. Klbkch hadn’t moved. The Centenium spoke loudly.
“Twisted Queen. Anand is the highest-leveled Individual I have brought. His death is unacceptable.”
“Very. Well. Then another.”
The Twisted Queen lowered Anand slightly, sounding annoyed. She reached down and the Soldiers fled.
It wasn’t an order from anyone. The Painted Antinium just ran the way they had come. They believed in Heaven. But if there was any place it wasn’t to be found…
Klbkch was as surprised as the Twisted Queen. She peered at the tunnel, then Anand.
“Interesting. Aberration. Or will. Then—”
She lifted the [Strategist] again.
“My Queen. Stop.”
The Twisted Queen ignored Klbkch. She was manipulating the pod, which was another living Antinium—in a sense. It was just designed to create, incubate life. Or—take it apart? Anand hadn’t known—he was struggling.
“No, no, no—Revalantor Klbkch! Revalantor—”
“Twisted Queen. Enough.”
Wrymvr was watching. The Twisted Queen ignored Klbkch, and he was far too small to even reach Anand. She lowered the [Strategist] and Anand screamed.
“Klbkch! Father!”
The word slipped out. A question Anand had asked Klbkch once. He heard nothing. His foot touched something that burned him—
