“It is demoralizing sometimes, seeing how few people will step up to try my kind of magic. I feel like more of a [Performer] than [Mage] with that little act.”
“Hey, I’d pay money for it. Relc, by the way. Ooh! You’ve got a good handshake.”
The two Drakes grinned at each other. Erin pushed in between them, glancing up at Relc and Grimalkin.
“Why do you do it, then?”
“It draws a crowd. And it’s proof of my abilities. Can you name another [Mage] who could lift a boulder over his or her head? It’s fewer than you think. Telekinesis is twice as hard as lifting it is. And that’s hard enough. Ergh. I only wish there was an easier way of doing that bit. That boulder’s not even that large—barely wider than I am. And it’s hundreds of pounds. But can you convey that to the skeptics?”
Grimalkin grimaced. Relc nodded appreciatively. Erin hesitated.
“Well, why not use weights? Or is that not cool enough?”
“Weights?”
Relc and Grimalkin looked back at her. Erin nodded.
“Yeah. Weights on a bar. Like—bench pressing. You know?”
They did not. Grimalkin raised his brows and Relc looked excited.
“Oh boy. This is some new crazy thing you’ve come up, right?”
“What, weights? You totally have them. Right? Weights? On a bar? Weight rooms?”
Erin laughed, looking from face to face. Then she stopped, because both Drakes were looking blank. She inhaled.
“You don’t know. Oh wow. Well, what about this? Instead of lifting a rock or something, you get this metal bar. And you put two weights on each side, see? So they’re like—they’ll be round, so the weight’s perfectly distributed. And that way, you can lift it and work out. And if you want to add more, you just add more weight. Or take it off.”
“Weights on a bar. Of course! And did you say bench pressing?”
“Yup. You lie on your back and hold the bar and push it up. You can do like, I dunno, three hundred pounds of weight?”
“I bet I could do four hundred. Hey, do you have one of those bars, Erin? That sounds like a lot of fun.”
“Nope. And if you two exercise-dudes don’t know them, they might not exist er…here. But you know what? They’re really easy to make. It’s just metal. Iron for the weights, probably. Or lead. And I happen to know two [Smiths] who have time on their hands.”
Erin, Relc, and Grimalkin turned. Maughin and Raekea broke off from their conversation to look up. The Dullahan frowned at Erin.
“What? Forging? I could work in Master Raekea’s forge. Or my own. But it seems inconvenient. And unless I’m wrong, isn’t this crowd part of your plan? A forge is hardly a space for an audience.”
“Especially mine.”
Raekea put in, looking at Erin. The young woman just smiled. And her eyes lit up even further.
“I can fix that. With a little bit of help. Relc, Grimalkin, would you mind visiting Pallass for a second? I need you to help lift something.”
The two Drakes exchanged a glance. Relc grinned and flexed one arm. Grimalkin laughed.
“I suppose I’ve got more time. What did you have in mind?”

“You can’t do this! Do you hear me? You can’t do this! Put it down!”
“Watch me! And watch your heads! Coming through! Whoo! This is like a roller coaster ride or something! Hey Relc, lift your end higher!”
Heads in Pallass turned. On the grand stairway, the people of Pallass looked up and saw a door coming at them. It was a magic door, true, held up by two extremely burly Drakes. But it was still a door. And open door. And in that doorway stood a Human, in a room, an inn in fact, staring out of the doorway.
