Interlude – Burning Alcohol
Page 20
The young woman clutched at her chest. It was…burning. With so many emotions she couldn’t count them. One was anger. Fury. She remembered Mrsha, the days of fear. Remembered so clearly she could have been back there, deciding to kill the Raskghar.
Anger. Fear. The two emotions were burning in her chest. Selys stared at Erin. The Drake saw the young woman clutching at her chest, trying to hold something in. But Erin didn’t want either emotion. They were reactions.
But something else was burning. Erin looked up. And she saw Calruz stop.
He had seen her. The Minotaur had not halted for anyone else. But he saw the young woman and halted. The [Guards] froze, swinging their weapons up.
Calruz’s arm was secured to his neck by a strange steel collar—he couldn’t be cuffed normally. And he had magical shackles around his legs, limiting his motion. But the Watch stared at him, as warily as could be. They kept their distance.
“Erin—”
She was neither angry nor afraid. Those were just emotions. Erin could have snatched at them. Could have conjured fire in that brief moment. She was certain. But she didn’t want to share that fire.
“I’ll be back. I’m not going to…”
Erin Solstice trailed off. She walked forwards. Selys moved to stop her, and then halted.
The crowd had seen Erin. Some were murmuring. They knew her. The crazy Human. And they knew her role too. They backed away.
“Miss—I have orders. No one is to go near the prisoner.”
The [Lieutenant] licked his lips as Erin approached. He was new to his role; he had never met her. But he knew her. Erin looked at him.
“I want to talk with him. I’m owed that.”
The Drake opened his mouth. He looked at the other [Guards]. Then he slowly backed up.
“Don’t get close. Back up! Form a ring, [Guardsmen]!”
Erin ignored him. She walked forwards, slowly. And stood in front of the Minotaur.
If you were cruel, you might even laugh. Calruz was thinner from his days in captivity. His muscle was still heavy, but the cell and his diet had worn at him. He looked older by a decade. And his hand was awkwardly bound to the neck-collar. But Erin didn’t laugh. She couldn’t ever.
“Erin Solstice. We meet again.”
He was the first one to speak. Erin started. Calruz’ voice was quiet. Low. But his voice silenced the crowd.
The Minotaur didn’t sound like a monster. He sounded like…a person. Tired. But he enunciated each word with care, with a disused voice. Quietly, he looked down at Erin. And she nodded.
“Hi, Calruz. We met once, in prison. Do you remember?”
He nodded slowly.
“You look the same. And different. I have heard much about you.”
“From who?”
“The Watch Captain. She visits me, sometimes. And Ceria used to.”
“She left. With Pisces. After…”
“I know.”
“Right. You were there. At the inn. You went in first.”
Erin felt a bit silly. But her head was crowded. And only the trivial words, the trite sentences came out. Calruz nodded again.
“I did not find my death there.”
“So this is what you do now?”
The Minotaur didn’t smile. He replied levelly, his blue eyes meeting Erin’s. She searched again for the madness, but she saw only tired grief. Sorrow.
“It was offered to me. It is better than the cell. Better than I deserve. It would be justice, to execute me. To let me rot away. I would rather death than confinement. But it is not my decision.”
His voice was loud enough that the crowd could hear. They stirred. Erin looked up at him.
“She still thinks you’re innocent.”
“Yes. And I…sometimes believe her.”
For a moment, Calruz smiled. And Erin saw a flicker in his eyes. Then his cracked lips sagged. He looked down at her.
