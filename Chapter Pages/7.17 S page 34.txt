The [Innkeeper] came after a little bit. Saliss stared up at her. And he was ready to stop annoying her after a while. She didn’t deserve full-Saliss. He respected her, liked her a bit. From a fellow person with a mask to another.
But the young woman didn’t chase Saliss away, or shout. She just squatted there as he stared up at her.
“Hey.”
“‘Sup?”
“Nothing much. People don’t like me playing cards.”
“You don’t say?”
“Nope. I have a great poker face, apparently.”
“What’s poker?”
“Cards.”
“Oh. You don’t say.”
“Mhm. Why are you lying on the ground?”
“…Because it was there?”
A stupid answer. But the young woman smiled. And she saw straight through him. Well—part of him.
“You wanna drink? Octavia says Chaldion got hurt. Is he okay?”
Saliss looked up at Erin. And he sat up abruptly.
“Chaldion? Psh. He’s fine. Ornery as always. I had a lot of drinks.”
“But is he okay? And we have milk. And blue fruit juice.”
Saliss paused.
“…I’ll have some milk. Chaldion? He’d probably like a visit. You know him. If you go visit, can you play chess?”
“Sure.”
“I’ll let you get by the [Healer]. And I’ll pay you to slip some spicy peppers into his food.”
“…I’ll think about that.”
The Drake found himself sitting at a table. And he felt a bit better as he found cards being explained to him. It wasn’t anything in particular he enjoyed. But he beat Erin in a single hand of cards by bluffing. Because her poker face was an open book to an expert. It was obvious if you knew what to look for.
And the Drake was alone. Alone, in an inn. Alone in a city. After all—he knew there were people like him. But there was no background, no understanding in this world for what Saliss felt like.
In this world. But someone understood. A young woman understood a bit. Not everything. In fact, very little. But she understood his mood. And the [Alchemist] relaxed. For—she had many things. Glorious fire. Flowers.
Keys, perhaps, to his potions. Towards immortality. He owed Erin Solstice nothing but goodwill. Saliss looked at the young woman and felt…content.
Until the door opened and reality stepped into the inn. The Named Adventurer turned. And he saw a flash of color.
Shimmering eyes. Azure chitin. A staff. And a slim, feminine form. Made for her. The Drake locked eyes with someone who knew exactly what she was. And he felt fear.
Xrn, the Small Queen stepped into The Wandering Inn. And she brought silence with her. She looked around. And she was a stranger and familiar.
She had been here once before. But not this inn. And this time—Erin Solstice paused, with a plate in her hands meant for Saliss. Because perhaps she understood.
“The Small Queen.”
Someone whispered her name. Liscor’s residents stared in trepidation. But those of Pallass paled. Not a month ago, they had seen a Worker standing on their walls.
Look. And remember.
First the Slayer. Next? Xrn’s eyes swirled like a nebula, changing colors, vast as clouds in the sky. And she shone like glory. Forgotten, until you laid eyes on her.
Centenium. The True Antinium of Rhir. Saliss sat there, looking at her. And he saw her looking back at him. The two appraised each other.
It would be—the Drake shuddered. Then he saw the Antinium’s head turn. She walked towards Erin.
“Erin Solstice.”
“Um.”
The young woman looked at the Antinium. Xrn smiled. She inclined her head.
“I would like to speak to you, Erin Solstice. Greatly so. I am Xrn of the Grand Hive. Do you remember me?”
“I—yes. You’re…”
“Xrn, the Small Queen. Hi. They call me Saliss.”
