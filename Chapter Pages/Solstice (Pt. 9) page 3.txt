Solstice (Pt. 9)

And the faces of the Goblins were changing. They had been so bitter. Defiant. Even afraid. But now—Numbtongue saw a laughing Cave Goblin, pointing up triumphantly. A mocking Hobgoblin.
Furiously barring the way. As if…something…had grown impatient.
Just a few steps. And there he was.
Headscratcher’s statue stood in front of a frozen bier. His arm was blocking Numbtongue. And the Hobgoblin’s face was relieved. So relieved. Tears ran from Numbtongue’s eyes. He ducked under the arm.
The last Goblin was laughing. Laughing so hard he was nearly doubled over even as he blocked the way.
Garen Redfang. A fierce grin on his face. Pain—Numbtongue saw the body beyond. And…
Someone stirred as the Hobgoblin stopped. Terrible fear seized Numbtongue. The body was moving. He reached for a sword he did not have.
And then he saw the flickering, tattered Goblin’s head rise.
“Reiss!”
The Goblin Lord made no response as he rose. He blocked Numbtongue. And he looked—
Incomplete. Parts of his body and face were missing. Not missing the same way his wounds in death had been. But gone. Yet he stood, barring the way with Garen, his brother. He spoke.
“—begone. Stay back. Back—”
He swiped at Numbtongue. The claws passed through the Hobgoblin without force or feeling. The [Bard] reached out and the Goblin Lord hissed.
“Back! Do not touch her! Back—”
He did not recognize Numbtongue.
“Reiss? What happened?”
The Goblin Lord jerked at the name. The head and blank eyes looked around, searching.
“Who? Who is there? Stay back.”
He shielded the body lying on the bier. Numbtongue saw…
Erin Solstice. Resting there. Frozen.
The Goblin Lord tried to block Numbtongue. Softly, the [Bard] shook his head.
“It’s over, Reiss. It is…gone.”
He looked around. But he knew it was true. The Goblin Lord stirred.
“Over? Done? Who…who are you?”
“Friend.”
The Hobgoblin whispered. Tears in his eyes as he understood part of what had happened. He reached down. The Goblin Lord reached up.
They clasped hands. Numbtongue helped him up.
“Thank you. Thank you.”
The figure smiled. And then vanished. Numbtongue waited. But all he heard was a whisper.
 
[—ry – Reiss—d obt—!]
[Skil—]
 
Flickering pieces. The [Bard] knelt by Erin, weeping for his friends. Then he stood, and placed his back to his comrades’. That was how they found him.
Amid the statues. Triumphant.

Five of them howled in fury. The long day had ended. One, a figure that was more ravaged than even the others, so…alien in nature, was raging.
But the fae were triumphant. The last had appeared in fury as the day ended.
Tyrion saw Melidore snarl. He raised his sword and—
—bellowed as the five closed in. The shadows were so close now. The mortals so tightly bunched together. And yet, the Summer Fae roared.
“Nothing assails us, kin! Nothing has dared cross into the boundaries of this party! Nothing has no right to be here.”
He pointed his sword at the five. They had stopped, warily. The six fae warriors stood, swords bared warily. Bloodied. But refusing to fall.
 
“You dare to show your craven forms after all this time? You dare to test the might of the fae? On this day? In this place?”
 
Melidore roared. The five did not fear him. They wanted the mortals. Laken most of all. But the fae’s presence kept them back. A terrible rictus of rage crossed Melidore’s face. More than a mortal being could carry. It changed his very features into that of maddening anger, such that even the five wavered.
 
“There shall be naught for you! Nothing to feed on! Nor anything shall remain! I see you. I remember your names!”
