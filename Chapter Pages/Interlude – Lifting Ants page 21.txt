Interlude – Lifting Ants

“Erin called him stupid. She called him mean, and wrong. Klbkch is strong. He is smart. He is good at fighting and he knows things. But he is also stupid. This is a fact.”
“I do not think you know what a fact is, Bird.”
The [Bird Hunter] looked at Anand.
“No? Then this is a fact, Anand. I am sometimes silly. But I am also Bird. And I know what I know. Klbkch is stupid. And he is not your father. He will not be, no matter how much you want him to.”
The [Tactician] froze. Bird looked at him. And his playful voice was serious. Mrsha listened. She did not know this Bird. But it was still him. Just—focused.
“Anand, you like Klbkch. But he is not your father. Erin explained how fathers work. And Klbkch did not make you. The Queen did, but she is not your mother. But that does not matter. What matters is that fathers and mothers love their children. Erin is a mother. Lyonette is a mother. Numbtongue is a nice uncle. Klbkch and the Queen are not.”
“You cannot say this. They are ours. They lead us. Do not say such things, Bird. Where do they come from? These thoughts are like Aberr..”
Anand’s voice was shaking. He was quivering, like a leaf before a storm. Bird looked at him, and shook his head.
“I have been thinking on it, sometimes. When there are no birds and I think of others. On the hill. You should see it. Come. I will show you.”
He held out all four hands. Anand stared at them. He backed away.
“Come, Anand.”
“To where? Bird, I cannot. I have duties. I cannot be silly like you.”
Silly. Was that how the other Individuals saw Bird? Mrsha would have agreed, if she hadn’t seen Bird when he was serious. She looked up at him, leaning against one of his legs as he spoke.
“It is fun, being silly. You should be silly. Life should be fun. Come, Anand. Follow me. That is my order as Bird.”
Anand was shaking his head, flinching away. Even the other Soldiers and Workers were. They were just words, but Bird shot them like his arrows. Each one finding a mark.
“I—am of a higher rank than you, Bird. I outrank you. You cannot—where? To the inn? I would go, but Klbkch will be angry. Furious.”
Bird spread his arms. The same way he had as he challenged the Walled City of Pallass. Unafraid. And his voice was louder.
“I do not fear Klbkch. I am Bird. If I had not played chess with Erin, he would have killed me for being me long ago. Come with me, Anand. You and everyone. Come.”
He reached out and took Anand’s hand with his own. The [Tactician] jerked, but Bird pulled at him.
“You too, Mrsha. Come. Hold my hand.”
Mrsha did, getting up onto her two feet. On one side of Bird, Anand on the other, she let him take her into the Hive. The [Tactician] was staring at Bird. He could have pulled away, ordered the other Antinium. But they moved aside as Bird walked.
“Who are you?”
The Worker smiled. And he sounded playful and serious at the same time.
“Me? I am Bird. That is what I have always been. Sometimes I am serious. But you knew that.”

The Hive of the Free Antinium had stopped only a few times. Once, for the resurrection of their leader by the Rite of Anastases. Another, when a young woman had entered the Hive.
Once, for the march of the Painted Soldiers. A Worker with a censer. For faith alone.
But now, they stopped for another reason. A Worker walked through the Hive. He did not march in step with the other Antinium. He was out of place. But not Aberration. He held a little Gnoll’s paw, and the Workers and Soldiers stared at her.
