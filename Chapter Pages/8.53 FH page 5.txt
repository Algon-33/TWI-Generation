Soldiers are screaming and running. No—they broke long before that. Came back. Tried to fill me with arrows, held their ground, retreating, and I kept coming after.
This is different. I raise my blade and pull it just in time. The [Rider] halts.
“Lady Mars.”
I recognize Reim’s crest. I don’t reply, just…stand there. The [Rider] dismounts, calling for potions, as more [Soldiers] charge, scattering the army.
“Pull back. Give me…five minutes.”
The man looks around. He’s no stranger to battle, but perhaps he’s forgotten. Or this is the first time…his eyes are familiar. Is he looking at a legend or monster?
He gulps several times. I just sit down. Five minutes. Glorious.
“Lady Mars. The King of Destruction bid us find you when he heard you had taken to the front alone. This is madness. Please, retreat with us.”
I would have fallen asleep, but I raise my head. I try to make sounds, but—I cough, spit. Try again.
“He spoke?”
“The order came from his mouth, Lady Mars.”
Djinni. They did not send Djinni against me. They told me he was so badly burned—
I am on my feet. No less exhausted. No less in pain. But I look at this officer.
“Is he still fighting?”
The man doesn’t know how to respond to that. I grab the potion, cough as it burns my throat. But I grab him—not even five minutes. The army is coming back.
“Then so shall I. Tell him I am fighting.”
I see him back away. I ignore whatever he has to say. I check my armor. Sword…shield…I swap the shield and begin walking forwards again.
It is a new army. Damn Nerrhavia’s Fallen. Too many [Soldiers]. And in truth—I am one woman. No Amerys who can kill them by the hundreds with each spell. But unlike her—I do not fall.
They shudder to a stop as my allies retreat. This time, I plant my feet on the ground. I raise the sword and strike it against the shield. Like a gong. I shout at them. They are brave—but I would try this against their army.
Not the sons and daughters of the House of Minos. So I laugh and roar at them.
“Challenge me.”

My second wind comes from no Skill or potion. They are falling back. I raise my sword and they look up at me. Am I shouting?
“Reim!”
Yes. I think I am. I sweep around in an arc and my shield catches a lance. They’re trying lances now?
I laugh. And I feel younger, truly. It has been a long time. But I waited for twenty years. I can wait another day.
I gave my life for my lord’s dream. I can still see it. Once more. Once more. They can’t see what’s keeping me upright.
But if he is fighting, so shall I. For a dream of kingdom, and the fallen.
“Tottenval! Queravia! Drevish—”
Like a chant. With each name, I feel lighter. The [Soldiers] shudder at each one. They are legends to you. Perhaps you are old enough to remember them?
I walked with those legends. And I know, in that moment.
I will not fall today.
This army is too afraid. Too broken. Already—they are beginning to flee once more. Perhaps I cut down an officer?
No…I cough, looking around. Suddenly, my exuberance dies.
Another [Champion]? I thought Nerrhavia was too canny to send their best to die against me. Yet—I lower my sword, reach for one of the new potions. Suddenly—alarmed.
I am in great danger. But I don’t see…
There. My sword sings again as I clear the space around me. They are still attacking, yet I sense the shift in the army. The movement in the back ranks.
It takes me another minute of fighting. Another hour, it feels, before I see it again.
Strange. Now they are fleeing, and I try to make sense of the shouting, but I am too tired to latch onto one voice. But why fleeing? I wonder—
