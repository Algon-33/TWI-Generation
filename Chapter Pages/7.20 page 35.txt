“Then I’m just old.”
Maviola closed her eyes. The Lady Reinhart nodded.
“Quite.”
The young Lady Firestarter opened one eye. Magnolia smiled.
“Lady Maviola El. Presumptuous as it may be, may I ask you to stand? You shouldn’t rest here. Not now. There is still something left for you to do?”
“What?”
Magnolia reached down. And her hands squeezed Maviola’s hard.
“Something. Find it, I pray you, Maviola. Age wears you down. But you must not sleep. Wake up.”
Her voice deepened. And it grew urgent. Maviola felt herself stirring as the other [Lady] held her hand.
“Age is your foe. But keep moving. Find something to do, even if it is selfish. But don’t lie there. Stand. Move, and burn. Fire dies when it stops moving. Maviola, do you hear me? There is still something for you to do, isn’t there?”
She had a meeting to go to. The Lady El inhaled. And her heart began to beat faster. Her vision slowly swam back. And she remembered.
She looked up. And she saw Magnolia more clearly. Slowly, Maviola’s head rose. She got up, looked around at the small crowd, at herself.
“Oh. I think I nearly died.”
“I feared as much. Do you feel yourself, Lady El? A stamina potion might help—”
Magnolia brushed off dirt from her dress. She studied Maviola, as the [Lady] looked around and blinked.
“I—shouldn’t have come back. Memory changes. Thank you, Magnolia. That was most fortunate.”
“It would be a poor ending. I think Invrisil is not for you, Lady Maviola. If you wish it, my carriage can take you somewhere—new.”
“No, no. And yes. But I will find my own way away. I have a meeting to keep.”
Maviola smiled. She looked back once, but then shook her head. Not yet. She clutched at her heart and breathed deeply. Savoring each breath.
Not yet. She had forever to rest. But what was the point if she wasted even a second? She looked at Magnolia, slightly mystified.
“Why are you here?”
The [Lady] gave Maviola an infuriating smile. Maviola remembered she always hated that little upstart smirk.
“I have business in my city. But I wanted to make sure you were quite well. I bid you adieu, Lady El.”
“Thank you.”
Their meeting had not been coincidence. But Maviola simply nodded and watched the coach roll off. Then, shaken, she walked forwards. Searching. For a flame without fuel did go out. If it stopped, it died. She wondered how Magnolia had known that.
But then the young woman walked on. Searching for that source.
And Magnolia Reinhart settled back in her carriage and watched the young lady with hair like embers in the darkness disappear into the crowds. She looked sideways as Ressa joined her.
“Apologies, ladies. I had to make a quick check. To our appointment, Reynold.”
“At once, Lady Reinhart.”
The famous carriage began to move. It rolled down the street. And Magnolia turned to her two guests.
Lady Pryde and Wuvren. They sat in the carriage, Pryde impatient, Wuvren staring after Maviola.
“What a [Lady]. When I was a girl, I grew up to stories of Lady Firestarter.”
“She seemed rather insipid to me. Her flame is long past.”
Pryde tossed her head. Magnolia tsked gently.
“You are in a foul mood, Pryde. Maviola deserves all of our respect. It cannot be easy, watching the world change.”
The two [Ladies] glanced at Magnolia. She had been rarely intense as she held Maviola’s hand. Pryde just turned her head.
“You said you had grave need of our aid, Magnolia. But so far we’ve been idly circling the city. I grow tired of discussion. What is it you want of us?”
“Well—first of all, I have gifts. We’re nearly at the [Seamstress] I mentioned. Ah, but she does hair very well.”
