“The Wings of Pallass. Gold-rank. To protect the city.”
Behind them came another group. Drakes, wearing robes. The leader lifted a wand and traced a symbol in the air.
“Scaleshard Mages. Silver-rank.”
And behind them came more. Drakes walked through the door, some staring at the Redfang Goblins, others visibly recoiling from the Antinium. Ksmvr stared as they entered and lined up. Row after row of Drakes, Gnolls, and occasionally other species.
“Rhine of Blades. Bronze-rank.”
“Tempest Singers. Silver-rank.”
“The Tail of Xil. Silver-rank”
“Meliem. Silver-rank…”
The people of Liscor stared. The adventurers, Erin, all stared in awe of Pallass’ adventurers as they came through in one unending mass. And at last they felt it. A break in the rainy sky. A glimmer of hope. Over a hundred adventurers entered Erin’s inn, fresh recruits from Pallass, from a Walled City itself. Some had come for glory, others for treasure, others because they had no choice. The reason mattered not. The tide had turned against the dungeon. Ksmvr looked around proudly. Pisces’ plan had worked!
After the last adventurer had come through, they stood, waiting for a signal, a benediction, thanks, anything. Ilvriss looked caught off-guard as anyone else, so the air of expectant patience grew strained. At last it was Jelaqua who broke the silence. She groaned and leaned back in her chair.
“Aw, fuck. I hate competition.”
