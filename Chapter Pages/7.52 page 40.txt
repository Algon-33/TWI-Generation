Lastly, Bird. The Worker sat in his tower. When he looked at Erin, it was solemnly as he gnawed on a drumstick bone.
“What does the law say, Erin?”
“About the Raskghar?”
“Yes.”
“It says—”
“Do that. I will have another question if you wish.”
Erin Solstice sat there. She looked at Bird.
“Do what the law says?”
“Yes. If it is the law and the law is right, follow the law. Otherwise it is a bad law. These are easy questions, by the way.”
Bird smiled, pleased with himself. Erin sighed.
“You’re right. Thank you, Bird.”
She turned to go. Then she stopped.
“You are right about that.”
“Yes. So you have said twice.”
There was…something Erin could do. She thought of it as she walked down from Bird’s tower. Just give up. Obey the law. Zevara was right.
The only problem was that Erin still had to ask—by what standard did you treat the Raskghar? Kill the adults? Kill the murderers and raise the children as best you could? It would be a nightmare. And that was if there was something in them.
She had to know. Erin walked through her magical door and came back thirty minutes later. She had a long conversation with someone and then came back. Lyonette looked quizzically at her.
“Erin?”
“Someone’s coming, Lyonette. This place will be busy—we might have to move the door. I have everything but—”
She clenched her hand over her chest.
“It still doesn’t feel right.”
The young woman had a decent answer. Even so—she could not forgive them. And that was the heart of it.
Erin Solstice hated the Raskghar. She hated what they had done. For Elirr—for Mrsha, who was hiding in the Garden? Erin wanted to kill them.
She took out the jar of acid and stared at it. It was more than she had felt for many enemies. Face-Eater moths? Monsters. You killed them to defend yourself. Enemy Human army? Oh yes, she hated them, but not with the same intensity. It was the leader who was most culpable.
This—this was like only a few others. Regrika Blackpaw.
Skinner. The Crelers who she thought had killed her friends.
And one last name—her greatest failure.
Toren.
Erin’s eyes opened.
“Toren.”
Lyonette flinched. Erin looked at her.
“Could you ever forgive Toren, Lyonette? Could you ever forgive me for…not knowing what he was doing?”
She had never forgotten or forgiven herself after putting together the pieces. Toren had killed people. Lyonette was slow in replying.
“I can forgive you, Erin. I…it took time, but you didn’t know. But that—thing?”
She shook her head.
“That was a monster.”
Her knuckles were white on the broomstick. Erin nodded. Toren had tormented Lyonette. He had killed so many. Tried to come after her.
And yet—she sat in her inn. And remembered how it ended.
He had placed his hands together and made the symbol Mrsha used in her sign language. A simple symbol.
Love. A heart. It had broken. And he’d removed his head and died. He—had been choking her. But he had not killed her.
Was that the last bit of redemption in a monster? Perhaps Toren could not be forgiven. But Erin had seen at his last—that he was not a skeleton. Not a monster, or undead. But a person.
He might have still deserved death. But she should have given him that chance long ago.
Toren. Erin slowly rose. And she had her answer. In Liscor’s jail, there were two hundred Torens. Not in the same way. But Erin had, had to trust Bird. The singing, silly Worker was the smartest of them all.
Trust Zevara. Because she was right. The law existed to protect people. And you had to believe the Raskghar were people. Who would be tried. Erin took a breath.
And she felt lighter.
