“You lost your money pouch.”
“No. Maybe. Perhaps. It might be down here.”
“Are you really searching—”
“Oh gods, Venaz!”
“Shut up, Marian. Move those hooves. I have to find my money pouch. I had a lot of gold in there.”
“It’s not worth looking through—watch those hands!”
“I am going to murder you.”
“Venaz, where were you? We saw you jump into the harbor.”
“Hmf. Hiding in an attic. I could ask you the same question, Umina. That is you, there, isn’t it?”
“Of course. We were in a ship—”
“Don’t tell him that! We’re competitors!”
“Oh? So you want to fight now, is it? I’m willing to settle the score, Marian.”
“Big talk from a Minotaur crouched next to my right hoof. Forget about the money, Venaz. It’s gone. You probably lost it in the harbor.”
“I’m going to kill you, Venaz. Do you hear me?”
“Then I’ll go back and find it there. I have to have my bag of holding.”
“Whoops! Hey! Watch the hands!”
“Sorry. I’m trying to kill the Minotaur.”
“We all want to kill the Minotaur. But—wait. Hold on. You said you’re a Runner? What’s one of your lot doing here?”
“I had a delivery for that Minotaur. Venaz. He dragged me into this. I’m going to kill him. Where is he?”
“Hm. Not here—”
“Hey!”
“Gah!”
“Sorry. Don’t get near me. This is a very small space. And it stinks! My hooves are twitchy.”
“Umina, you can cast magic. Light up this cesspit again.”
“Hold on, Venaz. That patrol was hot on our heels. We have to keep hidden!”
“Gah! Who’s near my tail.”
“Sorry. Where’s Venaz?”
“Over there.”
“No, that’s me.”
“Oh. Sorry, Umina.”
“I’ll have your gold. I swear to you, Luan the Runner. Just give me a second—”
“Alright, everyone shut up!”
“I’m going to—urk.”
“Gah!”
“Don’t kick me, Marian!”
“Okay. Okay. Everyone calm? Or do I need to kick you both again?”
“No.”
“No.”
“Very well. Let’s start from the beginning. Voices quiet. I think they’re searching the apartments.”
“…Quiet.”
“…”
“…No one here! Damn those students. What do you think—invisibility potion? Or…?”
“…Screamer dust is off that group. Let’s follow the sounds instead. Besides, did you see that Minotaur. Huge, ugly bastard. Venaz, I think. One of the Titan’s top pet students. Not worth fighting that.”
“Steady, Venaz.”
“Get off me. I’m going up there.”
“Over your dead body!”
“I’ll help with that.”
“Shh!”
“…Nah. Let’s go. Sorry for the bother, Miss. Alright patrol! Let’s—holy Nagas, what the hell is—run! Get out of—”
“…”
“I think they’re gone.”
“No kidding? Wonder what scared them off?”
“Maybe some students? Those clouds that Tulm the Mithril conjured?”
“Could be.”
“Hmf. You should have let me go up there.”
“And blow our cover? This is our hiding spot, Venaz.”
“You’re welcome to it. I just followed you because I had no other choice. I want my bag of holding. I just need that money. Move over. I’m still searching.”
“Aw, Venaz—”
“I promised. I won’t forswear myself. This is—gah. I’ve waded through monster stomachs cleaner than this!”
“Venaz, stop. I’m serious. You’ll catch something and you’re about to throw up.”
“Shut up—Umina. I promised. I need—”
“Will someone explain what’s happening?”
“Oh! Sorry. I forgot you were here. Your name’s…Luan?”
“Yes. What’s going on? What were those clouds? Why is the harbor filled with warships?”
“The Professor’s playing a game. Haven’t you heard?”
“Professor? What? No. You’re making no sense.”
“Sorry, I meant the Titan of Baleros.”
“What about him?”
“Uh—this could be tricky. Well, let me put it this way. Do you know about the Forgotten Wing company?”
“A little.”
“Raise that hoof, Marian. I feel—no. That’s not gold.”
“Venaz, stop. Look, Mister Human. This is all a game.”
