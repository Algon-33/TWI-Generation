Side Story – Mating Rituals

“Um, so how is it?”
Erin changed the subject frantically. She looked at Krshia and Selys.
“You said you’ve um, been with humans and Drakes and Gnolls. Anything uh, stand out?”
Selys snorted into her food and Krshia laughed again.
“Much stood out, but not so much with humans. It was disappointing, the one time I tried.”
“Really?”
“Yes. I had heard humans were not so different than Gnolls or Drakes, but there is a difference down there.”
Krshia made a gesture that would have been immediately censored on television. Erin was fascinated, though.
“Really?”
“Yes. Humans are regrettably small.”
“Small?”
This was bad. Erin had somehow gotten sucked into the conversation. She hadn’t meant to, but her sense of embarrassment and shame had taken a hike for a while and she was now horribly, definitely interested in the topic at hand.
“Um, how small are we talking here?”
“This big?”
Krshia spread apart two fingers. Erin frowned.
“No—they’re not that small.”
“Are you sure? I have seen them for myself. Very small, yes? Hard to see.”
“Really? That’s so disappointing…”
“No—no, they get bigger. It’s a reproductive thing. Once the guy gets, um excited, it—”
Erin broke off. Krshia was grinning and Selys shook her head.
“We’ve seen it, believe me, Erin.”
The Gnoll nodded.
“Ah. They become larger? Then that explains much. The one I saw remained small. No matter what I did.”
“I suppose the guy was just…nervous.”
“Frightened.”
“It is regrettable. But at least his tongue still worked.”
Erin sucked in her lips as Selys suddenly found she was ready for another drink. Krshia smiled at her.
“So how large do they become, Erin Solstice? Large enough to be useful, I hope?”
Now she was on the spot. Erin turned red—well, redder. She was in a state of permanent blush, but she did her best and spread apart her hands.
“Um. This big?”
Selys and Krshia looked at Erin’s hands. Krshia shook her head.
“…No. Have you not ever seen one?”
Erin blushed.
“Well, it’s not as if I could measure—is it bigger?”
“Smaller, I hope.”
Selys murmured. She showed Erin a much smaller span with her hands.
“That’s normal. At least, it is among most Drakes. Not that I’m an expert.”
“Mm. This is what I have seen.”
Erin and Selys stared at Krshia’s hands. Half of the inn’s patrons – the male half – furtively peeked around their mugs.
“Huh. So Gnolls…”
“They have the biggest, yes.”
“Size isn’t everything.”
“Is that what humans say? Drakes don’t say that.”
“Neither do Gnolls. Size is good, yes? Too much is bad. But not enough is not enough.”
Krshia elbowed Erin.
“You would agree with that, yes? A good size makes much difference.”
“I uh—”
Embarrassed, Erin took a long drink of her drink. Alcohol was good. It made all her embarrassment go away if she drank enough. But Krshia probably required a barrel, because she was still extolling the virtues of the proper penis.
“Mm. A good one is thick. Hard, strong—”
“Barbed.”
Selys sighed happily. Krshia and Erin looked at her. Erin’s cup was firmly anchored to her mouth, but she had lost her thirst completely.
“Barbed?”
She looked at Krshia. The Gnoll made a face.
“They are not spikes. But more like—ridges? Hard parts of flesh. It is not bad. Enjoyable, given time.”
“Ah. I see.”
Silence fell over the table for a few seconds. The Gnoll server took that moment to dart in, deliver the drinks and refills and run for it. Erin stared at her food. She’d eaten a bit of her plate, although she had no recollection of doing so.
After a moment Selys learned forwards and lowered her voice.
