“Good night, Garen.”
The Selphid stepped back. She lit a torch and tossed it on the pyre. The soaked wood went up in seconds. The Halfseekers watched as the wood blazed. Smoke began rising. The body burned and the three watched until it was nothing but ash.
No one said a word. Not until the pyre was smoldering embers. Then Jelaqua turned.
“He’s gone.”
That was all she said. Moore cleared his throat.
“Do you think the key…?”
He glanced at the pyre. Jelaqua shook her head.
“I checked. He didn’t have it on him. Or in him. He must have given it to someone. Or it was lost in the fighting.”
“Do you think it was true, what he said? About the Goblin King’s treasure?”
Moore stared at the ash. Jelaqua shook her head.
“If it was true, if there is a treasure up there…”
She looked up. The High Passes stretched up overhead. The Halfseekers looked up and took in the enormity of the mountains. So high. None of them spoke. Then Seborn sighed.
“It doesn’t matter. The key’s gone. If we found it—”
Then what? They didn’t have answers for that either. The three stood around, not sure of what to say or do. They were…uncertain. Until someone broke the silence.
It was Moore. The half-Giant stood in front of the pyre and looked down. His hands reached out and lightly grasped the shoulders of his two remaining comrades. The other Halfseekers looked up at him. The half-Giant’s voice was quiet as he spoke.
“Time. Time stopped. For us and for him, I think. Ever since that day we were shattered. And so was he. We searched and lived, but we couldn’t really rebuild. We couldn’t move on. Now we can. Garen is dead. We have fulfilled our oaths.”
“We did, didn’t we?”
Jelaqua tried to smile. Moore did not.
“We can move on. We can dream of the future again, Jelaqua.”
“Some of us have obligations. Debts.”
Seborn spoke quietly. Jelaqua nodded.
“Thinking of quitting, Seborn?”
“I don’t know.”
The Drowned Man folded his arms. Jelaqua nodded. She stared into the ashes.
“I’m tired. But I can’t just turn my back now, can I? I think…one more adventure? One more try?”
She looked up. Seborn hesitated. Moore nodded.
“One more time.”
“There’s only three of us.”
“For now.”
Jelaqua smiled tiredly.
“Maybe we’ll meet someone on the road. Maybe they’ll come to us. Or we to them. It’ll happen. The only question is what we should do until then.”
“Seek fame? Settle grudges? Earn money?”
“Maybe. Do you remember our old motto, Jelaqua? Perhaps that should be our goal.”
Moore rumbled. Jelaqua blinked up at him. And then she guffawed.
“Oh, come on, Moore. That?”
She punched the half-Giant in the side. Moore sighed. Jelaqua turned. She cast the pyre one last look. Seborn walked with her.
“Let’s go.”
The three began walking away. The last of the embers began to die out. They had no words for Garen. He had betrayed them. But still, he had been a Halfseeker. And the Halfseekers had…a motto of sorts. A saying. A goal.
The Halfseekers. The Half Freaks. Those who belong nowhere but here. Adventurers for hire. People, really.
Searching for a home.

“So, was it worth it?”
Magnolia Reinhart looked up from her cup of tea. Lady Bethal, Lady Wuvren, Lady Zanthia, and the women whom Magnolia Reinhart trusted most implicitly sat around her. They were in Magnolia’s mansion. They had left, and they had come back. And the world was changed now.
“I can’t say, Bethal. Not yet. But I believe it was worth the attempt.”
