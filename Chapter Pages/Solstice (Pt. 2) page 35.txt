He shuddered. His grandmother’s face had been hers. And he had forgotten how she had looked the day he laid her to rest.
“Oh yes. She is for those who have lost love. As opposed to that which tends only to what is lost. Both are a poor match for you. After all—you haven’t lost anything. And yet you have.”
“My family.”
Luan’s grip tightened on the paddle, and then he released it. Not a day went by that it didn’t hurt. And he wanted it to hurt. He was terrified of forgetting.
The smiling figure nodded.
“I could help you, you know. Soon, all will change. You will have need of allies. And I am far beyond any other.”
“No thanks. She said the exact same thing. Can you bring me my wife, my child? Not a false image. Can you help me be together with them again?”
Silence. Luan spat into the water.
“I thought so. My answer is the same. I do not care what you are. Devil. Demon. You won’t take my soul. I deny you.”
A sigh.
“Such harshness. You do not even know what I am. But we—all six of us would like you most of all.”
“Why me? How many more are you going after?”
Paige. Daly! Geneva! Luan wanted to row back the way he’d come. He had to—the figure laughed, lightly. Luan nearly laughed in reply. But he stopped himself.
“You? You are the greatest of them all, Luan Khumalo! A champion of your world.”
He gestured at Luan, who had been an athlete. The world’s best.
“If only in your strange sport. Why…rowing? Why did you return to it?”
Now the stranger seemed almost…peeved. He gestured around, at the still spell and [Bounty Hunters] on the water.
“You could have been anything here. Why this?”
“Because I’m good at this. The best. I don’t want to be a [Warrior]. Or kill.”
“How disappointing.”
Luan neither cared nor wanted the approval of…he half-turned, looking for a way out. As he did, the oar slipped and began to sink into the water.
Cursing, Luan grabbed for it. He reached down—
And stopped.
The grasping hand had nearly touched his. Slowly—the man placed the oar back on the scull. He looked visibly disappointed.
“Tricks.”
Luan whispered, through pale lips. He was sweating.
“We are desperate. I am sorry. But I asked.”
A small grin. Luan felt his skin trying to leave his body.
“Go. Away. Please.”
He whispered.
“I will not take your hand. Ever.”
For the longest time, the man regarded Luan. Searching him. Luan thought of his wife, the child he had yet to meet. He refused to move. To look it in the eyes.
“Do you not want…power?”
The whisper at last. The figure looked towards the drifting sun. Time was running out. For which one? He turned to Luan.
“You stand in another world, Luan. One with such great powers. Do you not want…an advantage? Strength beyond what anyone else could claim? A head start? More?”
The athlete leaned on his paddles. He stared at the dancing man.
“You mean…do I want to cheat? I believe in winning fairly.”
“But there are no rules. No competition. Others are born with advantages. Do you not want to win?”
“Not the way you would have me do it. I say it again: begone, monster.”
Luan looked away. He felt…was that a wave coming? He gasped in relief.
But the eyes bored into his head. Now, the figure was angry. He rose, and stood upon the glassy surface. His feet began to sink into the water. Then his knees. His torso.
“I have failed twice. I shall not return for you. Nor have I time left. You disappoint me.”
He was up to his chest. Then his neck. Luan saw waves moving across the glassy ocean, towards him. He began to paddle towards it.
“You will not take any of my friends, you damned thing.”
