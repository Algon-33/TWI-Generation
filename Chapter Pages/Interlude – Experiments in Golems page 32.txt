Interlude – Experiments in Golems

“[Student] and [Teacher] are complimentary classes, Nsiia. Both allow for knowledge to be spread far more efficiently than a [Blacksmith] might, even if he were to take a dozen apprentices. A difficult task for most. Is it not better to teach dozens, even hundreds at the same time?”
“Perhaps if you never wield a blade forged by students taught by words on a board! Or used a pot made by a smith who hasn’t created ten thousand over her apprenticeship!”
The former [Empress] folded her arms, adamantly. Her voice was a bit too loud though, because there was a titter of laughter from the classroom and the [Teacher] paused, much abashed.
Femithain’s lips moved up in a slight smile. He answered Nsiia in a carrying tone.
“In that you are correct, Empress Nsiia. However—not all [Students] who learn from this specific class will become [Blacksmiths]. Those that do will learn the craft by hand, through practice. But consider—some students may help create forges, not shape steel alone. The knowledge of how steel is made is invaluable in many regards. And given the need for steel in Golems—steel in quantity, not elegant masterworks—a class like this is more efficient.”
“But why split classes? What will being a [Student] do?”
Femithain once again nodded at the [Students], who looked worried about the [Empress]’ scorn for their class.
“A [Student] has Skills that increase their capacity to learn. It may be that they will lack the complete training from infanthood that some [Warriors] or other classes possess. However—a [Student] may become a [Learned Warrior], or gain Skills a regular [Warrior] might not. [Indirect Bombardment], for instance, is a Skill that [Archers] who have studied the physics of ballistics sometimes gain. Mainly though, [Empress], it is a class for those who are seeking their place. They need only learn in school, not commit themselves to a path that may not suit them.”
It seemed like a poor excuse to Nsiia, but she was willing to accept Femithain’s reasoning to some degree. Throwing yourself entirely into a class and realizing it was not for you was…painful. She had seen many like that, trapped below Level 20 because they were not good or interested in what defined them.
However, Femithain’s next words sold the entire class and Nsiia.
“For proof there is some success in Illivere’s teaching methods, consider that I was a [Student] myself. I graduated with top marks before earning my apprenticeship among the Golem Manufactoriums. My education was wide, and I believe it helped me become Magus-Crafter. Of course, it does require effort. And we should not distract from the student’s learning time. Teacher, our pardons.”
He nodded and the [Teacher] bowed. Nsiia walked away, feeling eyes on her back. She peeked back only once. Femithain saw the former monarch scribbling something down on a piece of paper. After all, if someone was going to write the secret of steel’s heat down…
The students were all abuzz with the visit of the two. The [Teacher] called for order—three times.
“Settle down. I’d like your attention—we have a curriculum we must stick to and we’ve already lost enough time to the er, war with Tiqr. I said—”
He saw that his students were whispering, too excited to actually take Femithain’s advice and study. So the [Teacher] sighed. Then smiled and clapped his hands.
[Thunderclap Palms]. The students recoiled from the explosion of sound. The [Teacher] tapped the board with a ruler.
