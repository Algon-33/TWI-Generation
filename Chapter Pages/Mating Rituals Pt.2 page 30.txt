Mating Rituals Pt.2

“Hey, Erin. Sorry. I was a bit delayed, but I am running north. Bunch of deliveries around Invrisil—and it’s dicier, with the Assassin’s Guild. But uh, I wanted to stop by.”
“Hey, sounds great! Can I get you anything? Carrot cake? Carrot bread?”
“You know—I’ll take some bread. And cookies?”
“We can make some right now.”
Lyonette hurried over; the Courier was a big customer. Erin smiled at Hawk. And not in a sexual way!
Yes, she had eyed his poofy tail and yes, she wanted to touch it. It was a bunny poofball! On Hawk! But that was all. She could admire his physique, but wanting to…no. Nope!
“I can’t stay long enough for cookies, but I’ll pay for whatever you have in stock. Thank you.”
The Courier nodded at Lyonette. She hurried into the kitchen and Hawk looked around.
“Can I get you a drink? A Minotaur’s Punch? Oh, right. Alcohol and running.”
Hawk gave Erin a smile.
“Exactly. No, I’m just here to uh—oh. Excuse me a moment, would you?”
He walked across the room. With each stride, Hawk seemed to go twice as far as normal. A Courier’s Skills. Erin saw him pause at a table, and sit down. She heard his voice and slapped herself in the face. Hard. But there he was. Sitting across from Selys.
“So, I’m heading north, but I’d love to reconnect again when I come back this way.”
“I’d like that. No promises, but it was a fun night yesterday.”
Selys smiled. Erin stopped herself from slapping herself a third time. Hawk smiled.
“I did enjoy it. Can I bring you a souvenir?”
“You can. But nothing too big, or I’ll have to reply. Let’s not get into a gift-war.”
“Never fear.”
The Courier was laughing with Selys for a moment as Lyonette hurried out with his food in a bag. He put it into a bag of holding, paid, and stopped by Erin. She said something; he left.
“Well…”
Selys was sitting at her table, sipping calmly from a fruit drink with ice, courtesy of the sad flames as Erin and Drassi converged on the table. The Drake looked calmly at her friends.
“So, he’s a nice guy. And we dated before.”
“You—what? But—”
Erin pointed at Hawk. Selys and Hawk? Drassi was grinning ear-to-ear.
“You said you liked him, Selys! What changed?”
“Well, good carrot-based foods for one. Erin helped there. And…I’m wealthy and Hawk’s always been rich. It used to be people going after him for his gold, but now I think he and I understand each other more, you know? So we can do the same things without it being awkward.”
“Wow. And I imagine a Courier—”
“Whoa. Whoa. Hold on. You two? Really?”
Erin was incredulous. Selys just smiled coyly.
“It’s casual. If we find anyone we like, we’ll stop. Neither one of us expects it to go the distance. But—yes. What’s the big deal, Erin? What’s wrong with us?”
She gave Erin a look. The young woman opened and closed her mouth. And it was a disapproving sniff from across the room that answered her.
“Bit of a stretch, Beastkin Rabbit and a Drake. Or am I wrong?”
Erin turned in her seat. She stared at Menolit and with a sinking feeling in her heart, realized he was drunk. And it wasn’t even evening. The Drake [Veteran] glared at the three young women.
“Too good for Drakes, Miss?”
“Excuse me?”
Selys’ face went flat as Menolit stood up. But Erin and Drassi both saw her narrow her eyes. Menolit didn’t seem to care. He seemed to relish the hostile attention.
