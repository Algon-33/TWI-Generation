Grimalkin rubbed his claws together. Kel tried to protest, but Erin hip-bumped him to one side and motioned Maughin up.
“Yeah! Come on through! Promise it’s not a trap. Hey Mrsha! Watch out! Maughin’s coming through.”
The Dullahan hesitated. He peered through the doorway, but, encouraged by Erin’s smile and very interested despite himself, stepped through the doorway. He blinked as his foot hit the floor of Erin’s inn. He turned around, blinking, then peered into the room.
“Incredible. Are we really—”
He turned to look at Erin and the door went dead. Kel swore. Erin just groaned.
“Aw. He was too big! Normally we can get three people through. Don’t worry! I heard Ceria on the other side. She can charge the door!”
Grimalkin looked surprised. He raised is brows.
“It ran out of mana? No wonder. But that’s a simple enough fix.”
So saying, he put a claw on the door and took a breath. Erin blinked at him.
“You can recharge it?”
“I am a [Mage]. Hm. This door drains mana like no one’s business. But no matter. Concentration! Huah!”
His shout made Kel, Erin, and the onlookers jump. The image of Erin’s inn immediately reappeared in the doorway, like a television turning on. Erin saw Maughin peering at the door anxiously a few steps back. Pisces blinked into the door and both he and Ceria recoiled.
“Wow! What was that?”
“Hi Ceria! Morning! Grimalkin just fixed the door. Thanks! How’d you do it so fast?”
Erin turned to Grimalkin. Pisces stared as Grimalkin flexed one arm and his entire body rippled. The Drake replied casually.
“A [Mage] can store mana in his body. I just released some. May I enter?”
“No—”
Erin elbowed Kel in the side.
“Please! Me next!”
Grimalkin stepped delicately through the doorway, and then Erin. She turned and saw Kel glaring at her from Pallass.
“Sorry Kel! They’ll be back later! Watch the door for me, alright?”
“Watch Captain Venim will hear about this, you—you—”
Erin shut the door on his face. She turned and beamed at Grimalkin. He was looking around her inn. So was Maughin. The Dullahan blinked up at the ceiling that even he could stand naturally under, and then the large room.
“This is quite spacious. Impressively so. No inn in Pallass has this much space.”
“It’s clearly the result of dimensional magic. Or a Skill. See how the room just repeats itself minus the windows after this point? Fascinating. And useful. So we’re in Liscor?”
Grimalkin strode over to a window. He looked out, exclaimed, and peered around excitedly. Maughin looked up.
“What is it?”
“Come and see! The entire landscape is changed! We’re right in the middle of the High Passes!”
The Dullahan’s jaw dropped. He strode over, avoiding a chair, and pulled off his head to see. Erin heard a faint sound; she turned and saw Ceria staring open-mouthed at the Dullahan.
“It’s—Erin, is that a War Walker?”
“Naw, just Maughin. He’s big, but not War Walker big. Hey Pisces.”
The [Necromancer] didn’t immediately respond. He was staring at Maughin and Grimalkin both. Then he looked at Erin.
“That Drake is a powerful [Mage].”
“Yup. He’s a [Sinew Magus] or something. His name is Grimalkin.”
“Grimalkin. You mean, the Grimalkin? The insane fool who thinks magic is tied to the body?”
“That would be me.”
Grimalkin’s claw fell on Pisces’ shoulder. The [Necromancer] paled. He turned. Grimalkin looked disapprovingly down at him.
“And you would be…a [Necromancer]. No, don’t bother answering. I can tell. Your aura screams death magic. And the half-Elf’s a [Cryomancer]. Poor form, both of you. You at least have some arm and leg muscle, boy, but you’re both completely unfit.”
