Solstice (Pt. 2)

The word was like—Ryoka touched her chest.
“N-no?”
Melidore tossed down his cup onto the ground. Grass sprouted around it where it fell. He straightened. And then laughed. He looked at Ryoka with those bright eyes. That smile that spoke hate for the very ground he stood on, and shook his head.
“The Summer Court descends upon this world for the third great celebration of our nature. For this day! For nothing. To see nothing.”
His words were a rustle around the suddenly-silent party. The fae stepped left. He looked around.
 
“Some come for what may be gained.”
 
Sikeri glowered from the ranks of the guests.
Step. Melidore’s head turned.
 
“Some come for what might happen.”
 
Silver Pines bowed his head, with the sighing of forests. Wind in the branches. The fae inclined his head once.
Step.
 
“Some come only for merriment’s sake. And that is I. Nor will I help you break any rules.”
 
He turned to face Ryoka. And his smile was cruel as the sun. He knew her pain. He knew her tears. He knew why she asked. And he denied her.
“I am of the Faerie King’s court. Did you think I would break his rules so lightly, mortal?”
He taunted her. The others laughed. Some cruelly. Others shook their heads at Ryoka sympathetically. But no one was surprised. Melidore turned.
“There is your answer. Boon for boon. My kin. The longest day wanes. It is time to leave this empty place behind. Conduct what—”
“Stop.”
Ryoka Griffin stepped after him. Melidore’s head turned. He looked at Ryoka, then ignored her. She reached for him.
“St—”
Fingers covered her mouth. Lightly, gripping her throat. Laughter in her ears. She held still as Melidore walked away. Ryoka shouted, but she was bound fast. She called for the wind—
 
“It is our friend too. You have failed. Failed!”
 
A whisper. She fought, but the wind did not listen. Melidore was turning away again. And then the second voice spoke.
“Stop.”
The fingers loosened. Ryoka gasped. Melidore turned.
And there he was. Laken Godart stepped into the party of the fae.
Alone. And then—his folk fell in behind him.
Mister Prost. Lady Rie. Gamel, Durene, Wiskeria—they formed an army behind him.
“Who are you to give me orders, intruder who claims ownership of this land?”
Melidore stared at Laken. The [Emperor] ignored him. He nodded.
“Someone who believes in letting people speak. Go on.”
Ryoka tore free from the fae. She shouted. She had known it would come to this.
“Melidore of the Fae! Stop! If you will not help me, then I will ask you again. In the old ways.”
He turned. And suddenly—the summer was harsh once more.
“Do not.”
The Wind Runner shook her head. She looked around and said it.
“In the name of the Faerie King, I crave a threefold boon!”
The fae went silent. Ryoka felt something heavy enter the party. A watchfulness.
The warriors stirred. They looked to Melidore. He lifted a foot, as if to step away, to be done with it.
But he could not. He turned back with a sound like fury. And his eyes—Ryoka refused to quail.
 
“Speak. You invoke a boon? You dare?”
 
She met his eyes.
“I do. By the right of hospitality, I ask you to help me.”
She gestured at the party. All she had done! And he had granted her only the right to ask and be refused? The fae nodded, uncertainly. Melidore snarled. Ryoka went on.
“By friendship and loss, I crave your favor.”
She appealed to the fae. Had they not seen her friend’s need? Had Ivolethe not died for her? More were nodding. But Melidore was unmoved.
So, the last reason. The greatest one, which she had only known now. Ryoka took a breath, and then pointed at him.
