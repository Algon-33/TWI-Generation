She felt wretched. Worthless. Mrsha was gone. Kidnapped! And she couldn’t even go after her.
“Absolutely not. You’re not a fighter. Neither am I.”
Drassi had her arms under Selys’ shoulders and was holding her friend back. Selys whirled around.
“Then what do I do, Drassi?”
The [Heiress] whirled, shrieking at her friend. Drassi screamed back.
“I don’t know! Put up fliers! Ask around in the cities! Just don’t go off tracking! You know what I’m doing? I’m going to put out an announcement on Wistram News Network! Gnoll girl kidnapped!”
She blinked, catching herself. The [Reporter] looked around.
“I am going to do that.”
Selys blinked too, at Drassi.
“That’s…a good idea. A really good one.”
“Right. So what are you going to do?”
The Drake looked around. What was she going to do? She was—was—
She spotted Fierre, speaking with some of the others. The Human girl was standing in the shade of the inn.
“I’m going too. Ryoka asked me to come.”
“She’s not coming? Ryoka? I thought she’d be here! The Halfseekers are going to come and search as soon as they can! Griffon Hunt went the wrong way to Riverfarm—they’re trying to figure out if they can make it! Listen. I don’t uh—know you well. But how well is this thought out? Do you have a plan? You can’t go south. Not you.”
Snapjaw stared at Olesm. She had come back, panting, and her Frost Wyvern was lying on the ground. She’d found no tracks. But there was a scent-trail.
“You need a Gnoll to track them. It’s faint, Wing Commander, but it’s there.”
Captain Wikir reported, glancing sideways at the Goblins. Snapjaw glanced at him. Olesm turned back to 4th Company.
“Yet you didn’t pursue, Captain Wikir?”
“Sorry, Strategist. It passed the Bloodfields and that’s enemy territory. Hectval could’ve taken a shot. If you want scouts…”
That was the issue. Olesm turned back to arguing with Snapjaw.
“You don’t have tracking, and you’re Goblins. If you go south, every Drake city and Gnoll tribe will take a shot at you.”
The Goblin [Eater] bared her teeth.
“So? What’s new? Who are you, anyway?”
Fierre had no idea, but she thought Snapjaw had amazing teeth. The Goblin gave her a sidelong grin. The Vampire covered her own canines reflexively—then nodded at her.
“Snapjaw, right? Fierre. We met…I’m going after Mrsha too. I’m not sure if we’re going together or apart, but I’m going.”
“You? Miss…Fierre?”
Olesm turned just as skeptical eyes on the, what, eighteen-year-old girl who looked half as big as Wikir? She had no muscle, and up till recently she’d looked fairly sick. Very pale; she seemed a bit…taller…to him.
“Don’t you have a job?”
She gave him a closed-lip smile.
“Yup. But I’m not entrenched and Mrsha is missing. Do you think we’ll just leave her to be kidnapped?”
“No, but—! You have no funds, Miss Fierre. You might have to hire experts, provide for yourself.”
“I have enough money for quite a bit.”
“And I’ll cover all expenses. I’m putting a bounty on Mrsha! Her safe return, I mean! Anything you need for travelling—a carriage, food—it’s yours.”
Selys stalked into the conversation. Fierre glanced up. The Drake was agitated, near tears.
“Whoever’s going to find Mrsha—I’ll help!”
Olesm threw up his claws, but in the next breath, he turned.
“Alright. If you’re going south—at least let me get you a map. You do have a map, don’t you?”
Snapjaw glanced up at him.
“…Yes? No. Give map, blue Drake. Thank you.”
