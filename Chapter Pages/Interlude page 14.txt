“That is her choice, yes. But my Queen has spoken. And her will be done. I have decided as well.”
Klbkch faced forwards.
“The tunnel will be expanded. The Hives linked, the passages guarded. The six Hives will be open to each other at last. So proclaims the Free Queen of the Antinium.”
The Soldiers shifted. It was the same as gasping aloud. Tersk didn’t know how to process this information. But the Workers just streamed past Klbkch, and got to work. Tersk saw Xrn’s mandibles opening and closing as her eyes changed color. Blue, doubt. Yellow, caution. And then—a bright white light. Green and pink.
She smiled. Klbkch nodded.
“We shall have to hide the presence of the tunnel. Workers, seal the entrance after my departure. Xrn. We should speak.”
“Indeed we should. Klbkch.”
He strode up the ramp. Xrn followed him. The Antinium looked up into the sun. Tersk saw Workers move forwards and the light slowly disappeared. But he remembered. And he remembered a city. An inn. He wondered if he would see Pawn again. And he thought that if he did, nothing would ever be the same.
That was probably a good thing.

Liscor was quiet the day after the battle. The relieved celebrations had given way to a strange silence. After all, the city had not been attacked. But a battle had taken place. And there were dead.
Goblin dead. Perhaps it didn’t matter. But the Drakes and Gnolls of the city couldn’t forget that it was Goblins who had been driven to besiege Liscor, and Goblins who had defended it. Both had died. And that meant…
Nothing. To some, nothing. To others, everything. But perhaps the effects were most greatly felt outside of Liscor. In an inn on a hill.
The day after the battle, The Wandering Inn was closed. The shutters locked. It was barred to all visitors, and indeed, most who would have gone to the inn couldn’t even find the willpower to try. The [Innkeeper] did not want visitors.
So her guests stayed away. Even the regulars. They found other things to do. Other people to visit.
And in Liscor’s prison, a Minotaur in a magic cell heard voices. It had been quiet. It was almost always quiet where he stood. His gaze was blank. But his ears twitched as he heard voices, coming closer.
“You have as long as you want. But try to bribe me one more time and I will arrest you. Is that clear?”
“Yes, yes. I apologize. Look, it’s just that in Human cities—”
Someone spat.
“Pah. Go on.”
The Minotaur stared blankly ahead. He didn’t respond to any words or stimuli most of the time. He barely ate any food. But the second voice. Something in it called to him. His gaze was fixed ahead of him. But as a shorter, slimmer figure walked forwards he slowly looked down.
A half-Elf stood in front of Calruz’s cell. Her robes were magical. One of her hands was nothing but bone. She looked up at him. The Minotaur slowly returned the gaze.
“Hello, Calruz. It’s been a while.”
He said nothing. Ceria Springwalker frowned.
“Hey. It’s me. I’m coming to visit you at last, you giant jackass. I wasn’t sure if I should, but—hello?”
Calruz didn’t respond. The Minotaur’s gaze was slightly unfocused. Ceria frowned. She walked back and forth and the eyes slowly tracked her.
“Can you hear me? Are you…”
She hesitated. A thousand things seemed to be on the tip of her tongue. She said none of them. Ceria folded her arms?
“Do you even remember what you’ve done?”
“Yes.”
The half-Elf jumped. She stared at Calruz. The Minotaur’s eyes focused on her.
“I know you.”
“I hoped you would. You’re—what you did—”
Ceria struggled for words. Calruz spoke again.
“Below. She’s still there.”
