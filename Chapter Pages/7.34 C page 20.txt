He gestured to the clown costume, yellow and blood and blue hanging off his thinner frame. The rings under his eyes. Richard looked at him.
“Awful.”
“Exactly!”
The [Clown] snapped back. He hit himself in the face with the palm of his hand and then pointed.
“He’s in here, Richard. With me.”
“Other Tom? I just spoke to Chole. She says ‘other Tom’ isn’t to blame for everything.”
The [Knight] saw Tom glare at him. Then grin. It split into an expression of perfect, cynical despair.
“Maybe not. Maybe it’s me. Or the Skill. The point is this is how I’m doing. What did you expect? You’re doing well. I saw you flying about.”
“I enjoy it. Is there a problem?”
Tom fidgeted. He couldn’t sit still. Richard realized there were no mirrors in the room. Tom kept asking for more. And smashing them. Hayvon had instituted a seven-mirrors-a-week policy. Which was fairly generous.
“Oh, no. No. You’re the heroic [Knight] who flies around. With a red cape. Hah! And I’m—I’m the [Clown]. One of us has to be the hero, right? Could you wear a hat with pointy ears and change your armor black? That’d make me feel better.”
“Tom…this isn’t a game. You don’t have to be the [Clown].”
They’d spoken. Tom was a [Clown]. He was insane. His Skills had given him another Tom in his head. It wasn’t his fault. It was his fault. Ever since the Fool’s death—Tom had gotten worse. Or perhaps he’d stopped holding back the part of him that liked to scare people.
“What are we, Richard? You’re a [Knight]—a man in shining armor! And I’m the [Clown]. The funny man! See what this world did to us? We became what we pretended to be.”
“I see it, Tom.”
Richard stared back at his friend’s face. Tom laughed again. And then his expression turned calculating.
“So what is it? You came here for a reason.”
“I came to check on you.”
“Don’t lie.”
“Alright. I came here to speak to you and talk about Emily’s plan.”
Tom began laughing again. He laughed until he ran out of air.
“Emily’s plan? Oh, right! Let’s go find more people from Earth! And bring them here! I’m sure Hayvon and King Blight will love that!”
Richard hesitated. He trusted Tom’s intuition. Tom was intelligent. Richard didn’t trust Tom’s motives, though.
“You don’t think it’ll work? Hayvon said he was considering it.”
“I didn’t say that. I bet he’ll go for it. He’ll send out people to find the people from Earth and bring them here. So they can be wonderful soldiers in his war against the Demons!”
That sounded true. Richard bit his lip.
“Then what?”
Tom looked at him. His eyes flickered and then turned to fury.
“I don’t know. Why are you asking me? You’re the golden boy!”
“I’m not Tom the [Clown]. Hero of the Blighted Kingdom.”
Tom started giggling again. He’d leveled up in his [Hero] class. So had Richard. But he was Level 4. Tom was…
“That’s me. A hero. They love me. Me! For killing people. You know, they’d worship a—a—fellow who could really slaughter the Demons. Kill them all? Gas them? They’d put up a statue. Says something about them, doesn’t it? I’m not even the most ‘heroic’ I could be. And I did my best. I fought for them, when I thought the Demons were just monsters. Look what happened to me. Look what he made me into.”
He pressed his fingertip into his cheek, hard enough to cut his flesh. Richard itched to grab Tom and shake him. Instead, he took a deep breath. When he spoke, it was to a point over Tom’s head.
“…You know something, Tom? I do think you got a bad hand. Whatever Skill or class you have—it’s driving you crazy. But it’s not an excuse.”
