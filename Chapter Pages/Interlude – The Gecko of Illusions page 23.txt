Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

“Do they exist? Erin, I have reports! I get them each month on what they did! They killed a bunch of Trolls last month!”
“But that could be a lie. Who are these [Mages]? Have you heard about them before the Golden Triangle?”
“N-no. But—listen, Erin. I don’t know what Palt says. What does he know? He’s just a—an [Illusionist]. Look, this is real money. Everyone I know has been getting it.”
Ryoka Griffin broke in, then.
“Does everyone get money? People who just signed up don’t get much, right?”
And the Drake hesitated. He looked up, slowly.
“Not yet. But they will. They just need to…”
“…sign up more people. Right? They get the profits. That’s why you have money, Relc. But what about all the people you sign up?”
Erin reached out and touched Relc’s claw. He jerked, as if the touch were electrified. The Drake looked around, holding onto the money pouch as if it solved everything.
“W-well. They just have to sign up more people. It works, Erin. I don’t see how that’s…”
“Relc. How many people are in Liscor? If you signed up a thousand…and all those people need to sign up a thousand—that’s already ten times Liscor’s entire population. And what happens to the people they sign up?”
The Drake opened his mouth. He hadn’t thought of that. He lifted a gold coin in a shaking claw.
“But the investment…that makes more money. Right?”
“It doesn’t exist, Relc. The entire thing is the money people get from signing more people up. It’s…just words.”
Cracking. Mrsha was looking at Relc. Ryoka slowly motioned for Drassi to take her away. She didn’t notice the watchers. She was focused on Relc.
It was—familiar to her. Like when she had run south, to the Bloodfields. The same look in the Drake. He shook the coins at Erin, desperately.
“How can it be fake? Merchant’s Guilds are in on this, Erin! Nobles!”
“I’m sure they are. It just means they were all tricked. It’s happened before.”
Erin and Relc looked up at Ryoka. She spoke from experience. It had happened in Earth. So many smart people, allegedly smart people, had joined up to these schemes. Because what was sold wasn’t the idea itself in pure, logical form. What was sold was…the allure of it. That was how a con worked.
And Relc was at the heart of it. The Drake shook his head as Erin and Ryoka spoke.
“No. It’s—you’re wrong. It can’t be. Why would I get gold if it was fake?”
“You were lucky, Relc. You were first. But it’s going to fall apart. Please. You have to stop. Tell people it’s not real.”
“It is real! It has to be!”
The Drake stood up. Ryoka felt a twinge of alarm. Relc pushed down on the table.
“Don’t say it’s fake! That can’t be true!”
“Why? Why not?”
“Because it can’t be—”
That was all he had. The Drake looked around. Erin stared at the gold coins.
“Relc—”
“No!”
He brought his fists down on the table. Ryoka saw the entire table jump. The wood itself cracked. Erin stood up, backing away from the table as the other guests looked around. Relc’s fists tightened.
“I didn’t come here to—it was a great thing. It’s not true. You’re mistaken.”
He looked up, shaking. Ryoka felt sick to her stomach. Relc had signed up one thousand people. And they had all probably tried to sign up their friends. You didn’t have to pay gold to enter The Golden Triangle, but it was encouraged. You got to start at a higher…rank if you did. But the bare minimum was just silver.
How many people were signed up? Why hadn’t Erin heard of it? It was spreading like rot through Liscor, and all the cities. That was why.
