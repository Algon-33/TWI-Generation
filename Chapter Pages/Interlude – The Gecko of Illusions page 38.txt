Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

“And I know that if I was here, I’d want someone to check on me.”
The Drake looked at her. Slowly, Ryoka folded her legs into a cross-legged position. She didn’t understand. But she did, at the same time. Even more than Erin, who was so sympathetic. But not always empathetic. And there was a difference. She would be here in a heartbeat if she’d thought Relc wasn’t sleeping.
But here was Ryoka. The Drake turned his head.
“Well, feel free to pull up some floorboards. But don’t do that literally. I get in trouble for that.”
The City Runner smile-laughed. She saw the Drake look at her. And she wasn’t giving a speech. She wasn’t good at that. But she was here. And sometimes that was infinitely more preferable to being alone.
“Sorry about the scars. I know I have an ugly mug. Maybe they help.”
The Drake went on, staring ahead. Ryoka glanced at him.
“They look—good. War wounds.”
“Hah.”
“No. Really. You don’t look bad to me.”
“It’s all my tail, really.”
“I can’t tell.”
The Drake half-smiled.
“Yeah, that’s the nice thing about Gnolls. Look, I’m fine, really.”
“Sure you are. And I’m a [Queen].”
The Drake snorted. He saw Ryoka stretch out. After a while, she opened her mouth. Then she closed it.
Silence wore on. After…twenty minutes, the young woman looked around. There was a little boar’s head lying on the floor near her. She picked it up.
“Is this a puzzle?”
“Yup.”
“Mind if I…?”
The Drake nodded. He watched, out of the corner of his eyes, as Ryoka found the little wire, and investigated the puzzle. After a while, he saw her frown.
“Tricky, right?”
Ryoka Griffin glanced up. She met his eyes for a moment and nodded.
“Yeah. You…collect these? I had no idea.”
“It’s just a hobby.”
He shrugged. But he watched as Ryoka bent the wire and frowned over the puzzle.
That was all. Relc kept expecting Ryoka to say something. But if so—he overestimated her ability to think of anything to say. She just sat there. Fiddling with the puzzle. After a while she asked him to pass another, easier puzzle over.
He did. The Drake sat there. In time, he ventured a comment on how the Golden Triangle was probably going to collapse soon. Ryoka agreed.
At some point, the Drake asked how he looked. Really. Ryoka glanced up. Gave her honest opinion. He nodded. Unconvinced.
By the end of the second hour, Ryoka had solved one of his puzzles. He showed her the cube. She puzzled over it. They talked. Relc began talking about other bad times he had nearly died. Ryoka Griffin listened. When he was done, she told him about the rubix cube, which she thought he might like.
Stomachs began rumbling after the third hour. The Drake saw Ryoka Griffin glance at the door.
“Erin’s inn has food. Why don’t you go there? It might be good.”
He looked at her. Then slowly, got up. He might have ended up there anyways. Embria had found Mr. Soot’s corpse long ago and hadn’t found Bearclaw. She would have gotten her father.
Or Erin would have, after discovering the clinic didn’t hold him. Or Relc might have gone himself. But Ryoka Griffin had. She said only one thing, as Relc got up and left his flat, carrying some of his puzzles.
He was tired. His illusions about the Golden Triangle shattered. Scarred. It had been truly a terrible day. And sometimes you had them. That, Ryoka Griffin knew. And she had no Erin-words that could redeem even the worst days.
So she just said one thing, and they were the right words. The words she wanted to hear.
“You did the right thing.”
