He nodded back towards the raucous celebrations. Lism was hugging and kissing everyone—he reached Krshia and caught himself, spat out hairs. Glared at her. She hugged him and raised a cup, roaring with laughter.
Maviola’s eyes twinkled as she looked at Olesm.
“You’re doing it again. Take some credit for your bravery. I didn’t do more than give you a nudge. And you were amazing.”
She sat up, came around the desk. Olesm was shaking his head. He drew back as she tried to sit on the same chair.
“No—Maviola. Listen. Thank you so much. But—I’m afraid it’s—you’re like Erin.”
“Erin Solstice. Yes, your muse, your inspiration. But I’m not her. And she didn’t make you. We established that.”
Maviola laughed. Olesm drew back.
“But—she helped. Maybe I don’t need to stand alone. But she—and you—”
“What’s wrong with needing help?”
She sat on his lap, facing him. The flimsy chair creaked alarmingly with both their weights, light as they were. Olesm tried to lift her off.
“No. Maviola—listen. You’re too much like Erin. I shouldn’t. We shouldn’t. It would just be like how I feel—felt for Erin—you’re too much like her. I shouldn’t.”
The [Lady] regarded Olesm. In the sunset, she threw back her head and rose. Her eyes flashed.
“I see. I’m just like Erin, am I?”
“I…can’t unsee the connection.”
Olesm whispered. He saw Maviola turn. He sighed, bowing his head. Then Maviola, who blazed with fire—did something that was Maviola.
She lifted a foot, and then stomped on the gap between Olesm’s legs. She missed him—barely. But the rickety chair collapsed. Olesm crashed to the ground.
Maviola straddled his body. She looked down at him, eyes gleaming. And she leaned forwards.
“There’s no one exactly like me, you fool. Or did you ever burn for her like this? Did she for you?”
The Drake [Strategist] gaped up at her. That was not an Erin move. He stared up at Maviola. Erin burned like Maviola, sometimes. But she was happiness. She loved the Antinium. But Maviola—agreed they were dangerous.
Erin was passionate. Maviola prickly. Erin was—Maviola was—
The superimposed image of Erin over Maviola’s face disappeared. Because she was industriously checking his belt. She looked at him.
“Well? Are we similar?”
“No. She’s wasn’t ever like this.”
He whispered. The [Lady] leaned over Olesm and reached behind her back. She laughed, young, vibrant.
“Then let’s find out how different I am. Unless you don’t want to?”
And of course, they both knew the answer to that. The blue-scaled Drake looked up. And then he nodded.
Maviola paused. Olesm hesitated.
“No, wait. I meant the other thing.”
She started laughing. And then her top was off.
Olesm gulped. But then he was laughing too.

Author’s Note: The poll decided the two perspectives. Which were…very different. And I am now on break. Do you think they were the two options you wanted? Or deserved? Or do you just not read the author’s note?
How dare you. Well, I am on break now. Until…the 23rd of May, I believe. Depending on your time zone and stuff. And yes, it’s 2 updates off. But I do need it. This allows me to write hard and relax harder. Or easier. I dunno.
But I may make this a monthly thing. I have written extremely long chapters even by my standards, and these regular week-breaks may help. We will see.
