Lyonette looked around, smiling, realizing her vision was blurry. Erin moved towards her.
“Lyon? Did anything else happen last night?”
“No! Nothing important.”
Lyonette lied. She knew she was lying. Erin drew closer to her. She put a hand on Lyonette’s shoulder.
“Are you sure?”
“Yeah. Nothing happened. Nothing important.”
The young [Barmaid] whispered the words and felt her throat close. She wasn’t sad. She wasn’t sad. But the tears kept falling. Mrsha grabbed Lyonette’s legs and looked up. She was crying. She had no idea why Lyonette was crying, but the Gnoll cub wept.
“Oh Mrsha. Don’t cry! It’s not bad. It’s just—”
Lyonette reached for her. She picked Mrsha up and looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked into her eyes. Lyonette saw a blurry face in her vision.
“Lyonette? What happened?”
“Nothing! Nothing!”
She said the words angrily. Lyonette raised her voice. She felt the world blurring. She was unsteady. So she sat, holding Mrsha. She felt Erin’s hand on her shoulder.
“It was nothing. Nothing. Really. It was nothing. It was—”
A hiccup. Lyonette tried to suppress it, but it grew worse. She felt the hiccup come again, and then turn into shaking. Mrsha clung to her, and Lyonette felt her tears stain her shirt. She began sobbing as Erin held her.
“Nothing. Nothing.”
And then Lyonette wept. She shook and cried as the rain kept falling. It was a bright, sunny day somewhere else. But here the rain fell and Lyonette du Marquin sobbed as the other guests of the inn came down the stairs, searching for the noise. The tears kept falling, again and again. On and on.
It was the beginning of another day.
