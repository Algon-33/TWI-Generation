Lyonette stared around at the ball. She stared at the newly-excavated barracks, the dress, at Pawn, helplessly insisting on helping her, and then thought about Krshia. Her eyes widened.
“Oh.”
And suddenly it all made sense. Lyonette blinked. She looked around and stumbled slightly. Her entire world shifted. And suddenly she looked at Pawn and saw something else.
Pawn. A Worker. He had come to the inn every day after learning she was sad. He had tried to cheer her up, tried in his way to make her happy. And when she had shouted at him he had curled up, refused to talk to anyone. And now, even after knowing she didn’t want help, he had tried to cheer her up. Yes, the ball was for her class. But it was also something Lyonette had said she liked. And that meant…
The Worker was babbling on nervously as Lyonette stared at him, stunned.
“Miss Krshia says that Erin got it wrong. I do not think Erin was wrong, but Miss Krshia told me to do this. She told me to tell you how I feel. About you as my friend.”
“Did she?”
Pawn nodded.
“So I did. I am sorry if it makes you angry, but I had to say it.”
He paused.
“It is strange, though.”
“Oh? How so?”
The Worker hesitated and scratched at his head.
“She asked me if I liked you, Miss Krshia, I mean. I said yes. She kept asking how much. And I told her. I like Erin. I owe her my identity and my life and more than I can give. But for some reason I like you more.”
Lyonette opened her mouth and her head went white. Pawn went on, oblivious.
“Erin is very kind. So are you. But I miss talking with you. I miss the days when you and I talked and you gave me advice. When I looked at you crying, I hurt.  I still hurt when you are angry because of me. But when I don’t see you I feel bad. When I think of you I am confused. But all of that feels good, too. Is it not strange?”
He looked at Lyonette. She shut her mouth, opened it again, and had to turn away.
“Oh no. No, no…is that what all of this was? Really?”
“What?”
Lyonette looked at Pawn. Despairingly. About to laugh. She covered her face. Her cheeks felt hot. How had she not seen it? She spoke, her voice muffled by her hands.
“You like me.”
“I do.”
“You…like me.”
“That is what I said.”
“No, Pawn. You like me. Not as a friend. You like me as…in a different way.”
“Which way is that?”
“Romantically!”
Lyonette burst out. Pawn opened his mandibles wide. Around the room, the watching Antinium froze in shock.
“I do?”
“Yes! Maybe!”
Lyonette was blushing. She looked at Pawn and turned beet red. Of course that was what it was! It wasn’t just concern. He liked her more than Erin? More than Erin? Lyonette didn’t know what to say. Pawn didn’t either. He looked around, confused.
“No one told me. How do you know?”
“I just do! It’s obvious! Krshia must have known. She must have—why didn’t anyone tell me? Why didn’t—”
I believe that you are rather missing the point.
Pisces’ words echoed in Lyonette’s head. She froze. He had noticed. But what he had noticed was different from Krshia. She thought back to what she’d done. Yell at Pawn. Feel guilty for hurting him. When he’d gone to talk to Erin before, she’d been hurt. She’d missed—
“Oh no.”
“What?”
Pawn was vibrating with nerves. But Lyonette was stock-still. She looked at him. She looked at the dress. She wanted to laugh and cry, and felt more afraid than when she’d faced down the swarm of Ashfire Bees. She looked at Pawn and they stood there in silence for a long time. At last, at long last, Lyonette croaked.
“You made this ball for me.”
