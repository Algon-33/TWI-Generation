Reeling. Regaining their posture. Trading furious blows, punches, kicks. Throwing each other. Locking horns and hands, struggling for a second’s advantage. Luan lost track of Venaz as the two threw each other across the street. He was in the thick of it now. Marian circled as Luan clubbed Dullahans trying to swarm the two. He was so lost in the fighting that when the first Human appeared he nearly hit her. The [Knight] jerked back. Then she lanced out.
“One side, [Soldier]!”
Luan saw her shoot past him. The [Knight] swept a Dullahan off his feet with a single slash from the wooden greatsword. Then she barreled into another group. She heaved and they went flying. She was fast! And the Dullahans went down like pins in front of her.
“[Knight]! Call in the [Mages]!”
“[Sergeant]—”
“He’s down!”
“Sixth Armor Captain! Captain Shailt! We need—”
The Dullahans were in disarray. Caught between Venaz’s perishing summoned creatures and the Humans led by the [Knight], they were losing. The Dullahan [Mages] fled backward as the Humans and half-Elves rained down spells from above. And their [Captain], the Minotaur, collapsed as Venaz landed a punch to her jaw and shattered it.
“Healer!”
Venaz bellowed as he stood over the fallen Minotaur [Captain]. The Dullahans surrounded their leader, but Venaz forced them back. He cleared a path himself, bellowing for a [Healer]. The Minotaur was carried away. The Dullahans, seeing their company leader gone, retreated. The Humans let them go. The [Knight] planted her sword in the ground as Venaz, panting, bleeding from both nostrils and stumbling, walked back towards Luan and Marian. The Centaur had only a few injuries; Luan was nursing a gash on his arm.
“Potion.”
The Minotaur tossed one at Luan and drank one himself. He stared at the Armor Captain being taken off the field.
“Damn. The jaw bone shattered. I—didn’t mean for that to happen.”
“You took that guy out. That was an Armor Captain. One of the Iron Vanguard’s company leaders!”
Marian stared at Venaz. He hesitated.
“She was strong. But she threw her weapon aside to fight me. It was a favor to me.”
“She?”
The Minotaur didn’t reply. He watched the [Healer] tending to the Minotaur. Then he turned. The potion bottle crunched in his grip and the [Knight] stopped a few paces away. She planted her sword in the ground.
“You two are students, aren’t you? Venaz and Marian?”
“Who are you?”
The Minotaur clenched a fist. Luan looked around. There were over a hundred Human [Soldiers] around him. He didn’t like the odds. Marian shifted.
“Venaz—”
“Relax. If we wanted to attack you, we would have done it. We’re on the same side. This is the first engagement we’ve won this close to the city’s center. I know the two of you; my brother speaks highly of both of you.”
The [Knight] removed her helmet. Luan saw a shock of sweaty, auburn hair. Pale skin, a battle-maniac’s smile. Venaz snorted.
“Your brother? You wouldn’t be—”
“Talia Kallinad. Come with me. I think Wil will want to see you.”
Venaz hesitated. He glanced at Marian and Luan. Then he nodded.
“Lead the way.”

“All four [Captains] have withdrawn. Some of their [Storm Sailors] are fighting on, but the [Captains] are done. They’ve had their fun.”
“Xol took out three of my Autumn Knights. We can’t stop him.”
“Merrik’s down, Wil. Peki, everyone else in his group but Kaelma. And she barely got away. We’ve lost our hammer, no?”
Wil leaned over the war table. He checked the map once and then twice. It added up to the same tally.
