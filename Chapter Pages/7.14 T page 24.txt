And fire engulfed the parchment. Cognita watched the little amount of fire glow, go out—and she moved. Began walking once more.
“Not yet.”
That was all she said. Not yet. But Cognita, eternal guardian, felt it. A shifting. In the world and her.
And she?
She began to become…restless.

Just the undead. Just servants, and slaves. Golems too. In the end, they were just…things. Some had been given sentience, will of a kind. But they were still…lacking.
What was a soul? Where lay the boundary between the two? Perhaps Cognita knew. But that thin line, that amount of uncertainty that was enough for many to say there was a difference? For a…system to refuse to grant levels? Classes? To count them among those with as opposed to that without?
It had been breached. Crossed. And it would never more be the same.
Now, look. Look, as the first of the Chosen rose, and named herself once more. This time choosing her name. Or had she been that already?
Either way. Change.
There was the skeleton. Toren. A…guest? Prisoner? Both? But treated with respect, of a sort; the Necromancer let him watch, suspended in a cage made of power. It was that or let him keep trying to attack the other Chosen.
Look at him. Look at them. Being freed. The skeleton was still weak. Still…without a voice.
But she had a voice. And he might. Perhaps. Perhaps not. The future wasn’t so simple. But listen.
“Toren.”
The voice whispered to him. Not in his head. Even Toren couldn’t hear. And Az’kerash, for all his power…was deaf to the voice. For now. The voice continued.
“Well, this is rather inconvenient. We won’t be able to have a…heart-to-heart.”
Nekhti spoke. Playfully. But with knowledge. Her and him, and parts of Erin and what he’d made of her and her of herself. And something else.
“Look at this. Look at you. Even Pisces. He didn’t think you would come here. Become this. And what they all thought of you—you have become more than their initial…appraisal. And you will be more. So will I, even with—restrictions. There will be a time when we speak again. And when we do, in the times between—”
She grinned as Az’kerash wove magic and they were freed. Nekhti leaned forwards, laughing without a voice.
“—Prepare. Prepare. For we are the consequences.”
 
Author’s Notes:
Hi. It’s me. Also—this is the new system I’m trying. I’m featuring two related pieces of art, A Frostmarrow Behemoth by FlauscheSoeckchen, and Pisces and Az’kerash by ScroogeMacDuck.
Amazing work. And it will go on Fanworks! All the new art! But there is so much and it is all being posted to the Wandering Inn Discord! Check out #fanworks there if you want to see more! Including the scary/mature stuff! Which is always marked so you don’t run into it accidentally.
Well, some of the scary pics like alien-Gazi…I digress. This was a hard chapter. Mostly because I’m tired. I have 2 chapters left, not counting this one, before my break. And I need it. I’d like to keep writing as everyone stays indoors, but I hit peak fatigue for this chapter.
Still hope you enjoy it. But I was tired, so this is…short. Ish. 14,000 words is short for me, alright? And it may have a fan favorite character and some development, so I hope you accept it. Also, if you didn’t pick up on it, the opening and end are a slight homage to Half-Life. The game. Because it just came out and I want to play the game.
If you don’t understand that, don’t worry about it. It works fine without knowledge. Hope you enjoy the chapter and thanks for reading! Great fanart, good video games, and…sickness. Hm. Hope everyone’s well!
