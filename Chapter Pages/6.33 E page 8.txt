The world was fading out. Durene kept on blacking out. Red, hazy pain and Wiskeria’s voice flickered in through her mind, filtering in through sleep as it pulled her down.
“Sleep. You’re going to be okay, Durene. Laken was worried. Just—sleep. And get better.”
“I thought I—”
 
Day 2 – Durene
 
It was a bad night. And a worse day. It felt like forever. Durene slept and woke in bursts. Her chest was on fire. It burned, with a deep, inner pain that tore her apart from the inside. It hadn’t hurt as badly when she was cut in battle. Now, it felt as though she were being burned. Her body was hot. And the pain—it went down inside her chest. Deeper, sickness turned to agony.
“It hurts. It hurts.”
Durene didn’t remember when she first called out for aid. She didn’t for a long time, until it was too much to bear. She’d never had anyone to look out for her. Not since she was thirteen. But she called out anyways.
And they were there. Voices soothed her. And she felt cool hands, cloths mopping at her brow. And then—unkind swabbing at her chest, pain bursting there. She pushed away weakly, but the hands came back. And above her, swimming into focus and out of it were faces. Voices. Some were familiar, others not.
One was Wiskeria’s, kind and worried. The other was stern, sometimes worried, sometimes not, but always filled with steely determination, snapping. Durene heard Mister Prost, Beniar, even Lady Rie, but never the voice she wanted to hear. They mixed together over the long night and the day, until the conversation was one confusing blur.
“Not going…increasing…tell him another day.”
“Clearly—my brews and poultices—”
“My authority here. If you—”
“Complexion’s poor…what should I write…?”
“…asking about you, Durene. ”
“Further south? Dead gods, what is Tyrion—”
“…here. Continue your conversation—”
“Not getting better? Maybe if…”
“…Another healing…you mad?”
“—No! Drop…and she will die. You…down now and leave my—!”
And then at last, a voice broke through the fevered mists.
“Durene. Laken’s doing well. He’s coming back as fast as he can.”
“Laken?”
Durene opened her eyes. She heard an exclamation. Wiskeria was looking over her. Durene blinked. The [Witch] bent hurriedly.
“How do you feel? Durene?”
“I’m okay. I just had a—nap. I’m hot.”
There was a strange look on the [Witch]’s face.
“You’ve had a fever.”
“Oh. Good I didn’t have a potion. That makes it worse.”
“Yes…you should rest. Laken will want to hear you’re awake. Healer Pirose? Hold on, Durene. Let me just call her.”
Durene put her head back. She shook it gently. Her chest hurt, and it was hot. Not as bad as the night, but her lips were parched.
“I don’t need a healer. Just a nap. I’ll get up tomorrow. Can I have some water?”
“Of course.”
Wiskeria grabbed a pitcher from the bed and offered Durene a cup. The girl drank thirstily and laid back.
“I’ll be fine. Tomorrow…I heal fast.”
“I know.”
Durene closed her eyes. The world swam. She licked her lips and raised her head.
“Can I have another cup of water?”
But Wiskeria was gone. So Durene lay back again. She was hot, then cold. The world swam. And the fever and the pain in her chest began to ebb. Too slowly. She licked her lips, wishing Wiskeria would return. She was a bit too—too weak to grab the pitcher herself. Which was rare. Durene murmured into the air as the night returned.
“Thirsty.”
 
Day 3 – Durene
 
The rain woke her up. Durene opened her eyes and licked her cracked lips. She heard it pattering overhead. On a roof of some kind. Not hers; she knew the sound the rain meant when it hit her thatch. This was different.
