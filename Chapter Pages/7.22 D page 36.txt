“Not that. But it all worked out. So—yes. Let’s talk about our relationship. You know, it’s always been you, you, you. Not enough me. So I think it would be good if we were finally equals.”
“I have to work. Okasha, my patients need me.”
The Selphid’s gaze turned into a snarl.
“Always your patients! I’m sick of it! You’re just a…one of those machines you tell me about. You work for everyone else. There’s no Geneva. Geneva would die for them. That’s not living. You’re sick, Geneva. You’re in love with your image. ‘The Last Light of Baleros’. I’ll let you help people. But I’m drawing a line.”
“You can’t do that. This is my body.”
“Our body! I help you move! You can’t do anything without me! This is our body!”
Okasha’s voice rose. Geneva saw, out of the corner of her eye, the Lizardgirl hurrying out of the clinic. She felt herself stand, pace back and forth.
“This is my body, Okasha. I was born with it. Doesn’t that give me the right to choose?”
“Not with me in here. You’re a terrible roommate, Geneva. And I’m putting my foot down.”
“And if I disagree how my body is being used? What will you do?”
The Selphid fell silent. She looked at herself. And then she shrugged.
“Geneva. We’re in this together. You can disagree. But you’ll see my point eventually. After all—I’m your [Inner Friend]. What are you going to do to—stop me?”
Silence. After a moment, Geneva spoke.
“Okasha. You sound like a tyrant. Are we friends? Or is this relationship one-sided?”
She saw her eyes narrow.
“Tyrant?”
“I just meant—”
“No, I see how it is. You want me to leave? You want to not be able to move?”
“No—”
“I’m doing this for us, Geneva. We’re one person. And you will see it my way. I’m putting you in the box.”
“Okasha—please—”
Geneva’s consciousness winked out. She was in [The Thinking Room]. She saw through her eyes. And Okasha’s voice whispered through her mouth. Affectionately.
“I’m going to have a lovely time with Timashi, and I’m going to eat and depending on what happens afterwards—we’re going to relax for a few hours. I’ll let you come along if you’re good. And then we’ll discuss how we share our body.”
“No. Okasha. This isn’t friendship. This is control! Okasha!”
Geneva shouted. But her body began to move. Geneva Scala, walked out of her office. She smiled and told the [Nurse] she’d be off-duty for the rest of the day. She went into the changing room, cleaned her armor, left.
She was perfectly Geneva. Okasha could mimic Geneva’s movements, her voice. But it wasn’t Geneva behind those eyes. She tried to push. Get free.
But she was in the box. And as Okasha left the clinic, she produced a nali-stick. Bit into it.
“Yum. Taste that, Geneva? You see it my way. You’ll see. I’ll show you how to live.”
It tasted good to Geneva as well. The [Doctor] saw Okasha, helplessly experienced the same. Okasha walked down the street, almost skipping.
And she nearly ran into the group walking towards her. Okasha’s head turned. Geneva saw her blink. And then focused on a marching column of…
Folk. Pale-skinned. Dullahans, Lizardfolk, Humans—only one Centaur. And they were—staring at her.
Okasha froze. And Geneva saw the pale skin, the telltale signs of dead bodies.
Selphids.
“Oh—”
There was a Selphid leading them. One both Geneva and Okasha knew. Calectus, the [Honor Guard] they had parted ways with. He looked at Okasha-Geneva.
“Geneva Scala. We have come to give you aid.”
“Oh—Calectus. I mean—it is good to see you again. Why are all of—these Selphids here?”
Okasha squeaked. She looked at the Selphids. There were over two hundred behind Calectus.
