“You two are both fools. Brave—resourceful. Erin Solstice took you out of this city. But that is as far as her power goes. She cannot ward you the entire way across Izril. And it is far to House Veltras. Neither of you could make it.”
Saliss pointed down the open road. He snapped, properly vexed. They were burning his head start!
“I have a better shot than anyone else here! Or what were you planning to do?”
Maviola El looked at Saliss. She glanced at Ryoka.
“Go with you, of course.”

Lady Ieka stared at the trio outside Invrisil.
“Maviola? I thought—wait. Wasn’t she coming to visit me? Where did she go?”
She turned for one of her [Maids]. A tremulous young woman answered.
“Lady El was here, milady. But she—only stayed for a moment. And when we led her into the parlor and took our eyes off her, she—she—”
“She what?”
“She stole your horse, Lady Ieka.”

Maviola El mounted the horse. She pointed at Ryoka.
“Get in whatever that is. Saliss, potions.”
“You must be crazy. I’m better alone.”
“You don’t know these roads. And you need us. Or me, at least. Erin Solstice got you out of Invrisil. She mustered an army. But she is still young. That is all she could do.”
Maviola began riding forwards. Saliss began running. He tossed something at Ryoka. She caught it, fumbling. A Potion of Haste. Maviola offered it to the mare and the well-trained animal took it. She drank one herself.
They sped up. Behind them, Erin Solstice slowed, panting.
“Maviola? Saliss?”
She had brought Xrn, Pallass’ army, the Brothers to bear on Invrisil. She had made no mistakes in her campaign to save her friend. If she had made the mistake, it was the same one Ryoka had.
It was assuming only Ryoka wanted to do what was right. Saliss looked at the two.
“I can’t protect you.”
“We did not come here for protection. We came to do the right thing.”
They were speeding up. But they slowed as someone ran after them, shouting with her loud voice.
“Maviola! What are you doing?”
The [Lady] turned. She smiled. Ryoka was looking at Saliss. He eyed her and nodded. Just that. She nodded back.
Okay, then.
“Erin Solstice! You will someday find your path! You will find your own flame. But today—I will do what you cannot. Look upon me and see what my life was, my heir of fire!”
Maviola raised a clenched hand. Erin shouted something. But the [Lady] was riding.
Smiling. Saliss was grumbling.
“We have a Runner who can call the wind and a [Lady] who makes flames, and a naked Drake. And what does the Guild have? Knives. Hooray. You two are going to die. Last chance.”
Maviola ignored him. Ryoka gritted her teeth. They began moving faster.
Faster. Ryoka felt the world slowing down around her. Not as much as when she’d drunk Teriarch’s potion, but—she moved faster on the bicycle. Saliss was running at full tilt. Maviola galloping.
Down the road. The Guild was reforming. Ryoka saw riders bursting from other gates, pursuing her.
“I hope you can fight as much as you talk!”
Saliss lobbed a potion an incredible distance. It blew apart, missing a clump of riders. He cursed.
“I am going to be impoverished after this.”
“I forgot something, you know, you two.”
Maviola spoke as she rode. Ryoka heard her—she was aiming a wand as she rode. This was not the time. But the [Lady]’s hair was blowing behind her. She rode high in the saddle, ignoring the [Assassins]. Looking up.
The world was ever watching. Maviola went on, for Saliss and Ryoka alone. For herself.
