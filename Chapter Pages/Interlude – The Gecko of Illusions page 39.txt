Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions
Page 39
The Drake looked up. He paused. And then Relc Grasstongue grinned. The [Sergeant] rolled his shoulders. The [Spearmaster] looked around for his spear, and realized Embria had it. The [Guardsman] felt at his scars. And the Gecko of Liscor walked out of his apartment with the City Runner.
Relc looked at Ryoka. And then he nodded.
“Yeah. I did, didn’t I?”
He felt just a bit good about that.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: This was an interlude. I realized the side-story poll was going to end too late for me to begin work on the Wistram chapter, which I assume won. I don’t actually know.
So I wrote two complimentary plot points into a single chapter. I hope it worked. It was one of those chapters where the villain dies, and no one else, so everything is fine and nothing really happened. Right?
Anyways, that’s all from me. Side story next chapter? I don’t know. The world is unpredictable. But I’ll leave you with this and some art. Let me know how you liked it!
For today, the artists are a pixel art of Ryoka by Eris, Yellow Splatters in figurine form by Mr Momo! And finally, yashKetchum did a series, including Relc! And for some reason, Yoda-Mrsha. I can’t make this stuff up. Give them all praise!
