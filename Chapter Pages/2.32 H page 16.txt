Ceria carefully picked both up with a piece of cloth and stowed them away. Then she investigated the other bodies.
“Magic rings? A necklace? And this sword is pretty good. Ksmvr!”
The Antinium walked over and Ceria handed him the sword. He studied it.
“This is a superior blade for a Goblin. Curious. My knowledge of Goblins indicates that this would usually be the equipment of a Chieftain, not a normal Hob.”
“Could this have been a tribe, do you think?”
Yvlon shook her head as she investigated another corpse, finding a gold ring.
“No children, no pregnant females. This is a raiding party, but it must be a huge tribe it came from.”
Ceria exchanged a look with Pisces. They were both thinking the same thing.
“Could it be that Goblin that Erin lets visit? Rags…?”
He looked troubled, but shook his head.
“I taught the Goblin a few spells. She is…intelligent. She would not be so foolish as to attack when the Watch is nearby, and these Goblins are different. Note the armor and the markings here and here.”
He pointed, and Ceria saw these Goblins had notched ears.
“That’s a different tribe.”
“Where did they come from?”
“South. That is what the villagers informed us.”
Everyone looked at Ksmvr. Ceria stared in that direction, worried. Yvlon nodded.
“They came from the south. From the Blood Fields. There must be a new tribe down there, a dangerous one. If this is a raiding party, what must their actual tribe look like?”
Something lurched in Ceria’s stomach. She breathed one word.
“Ryoka.”
