What a wretched hive of scum and…well, the Antinium Hive was actually quite neat. These…kids weren’t. Most of them were well—dressed, aside from the drunk Joseph, and another sloppily-dressed guy. The girls were clean, at least. But they looked…indolent.
Yeah. That word described it. A bit too lazy. As if they weren’t running about each day, or working. Too…bored, relaxed. They sat down in the parlor, sprawled over the couch, stared at Ryoka as Bekia rose and stepped back.
“You’re her, aren’t you? The Runner! The one that Erin told us about!”
Rose gasped. Some of the other Earthworlders stared at Ryoka. Joseph jerked up.
“What? We’ve got someone else joining us?”
“No. I’m just visiting. I found out you were here. And I—my name’s Ryoka Griffin. Nice to meet you.”
Rose stared as Ryoka held out her right hand. The City Runner didn’t know why—until she remembered her two missing fingers. She hesitated, but Rose gingerly shook her hand.
“How’d you find us? I mean—you’re an actual Runner? A Street Runner?”
“No. City Runner.”
“The Wind Runner of Reizmelt.”
Bekia spoke helpfully. Nerrissa blinked. Rose and the others just looked blank. Joseph looked excited.
“Wait. Is that a title? Are you famous? Or is that your class? I’m Joseph. [Warrior]. [Mage].”
“Oh. Pleased. What level?”
“Uh—Level 4? And 6?”
Ryoka stared at Joseph. She looked around. Rose was trying to introduce the others.
“This is Galina, Troy—hey, where’s Imani?”
“Coming. She was in her room. Oh my god. Do you have a computer? An iPhone?”
“I do, but—”
“Show us!”
It was—Ryoka found the others fighting for her iPhone, despite Rose’s attempts to keep order. Joseph, ignoring the fight over the technology, was trying to explain.
“We’re all sharing devices, but only one of us has a laptop. Mac. So we synched everything up—except for the Androids because…Macs. We don’t have any new songs, and we take turns playing all the games on Troy’s laptop—”
“Oh my god! She’s got podcasts! And music! And Pokémon!”
Ryoka turned beet red as the theme song began playing from her iPhone. She nearly grabbed it back, but she turned to Joseph instead. She caught sight of Rose, staring at her.
“How are you all doing?”
“Good. I mean—we’re Magnolia’s guests. Do you earn a living for yourself? Do you know what happened to Erin? I thought she’d come with us, but she never came back.”
“She’s fine. I think. She has her own inn.”
“Her own inn? She’s an [Innkeeper], right. But why is she doing that?”
“Well, she has to earn a living.”
It was like they were from different planets. Or worlds. Rose blinked.
“But Magnolia offered her a chance to stay. She could come here. Are you staying?”
“No. Actually—stop that, please.”
Ryoka grabbed at her iPhone. They were going through her pictures. Disappointed, the other kids—they were only a few years younger, but it felt like more—stared at her. Ryoka took a deep breath and met Bekia’s stare.
“What do you do all day? Are you adventurers? That’s what Erin said you were doing.”
The Earthworlders…paused. They didn’t quite meet Ryoka’s eyes. Rose hesitated. She looked at Joseph.
“Some of us tried. But it’s too dangerous.”
Joseph rubbed at his arm.
“It’s really—hard. Turns out killing monsters isn’t our thing. We fought these Goblins—got cut up. It’s—not for us.”
“Oh. So what do you do?”
Ryoka thought she knew the answer. Joseph looked around and waved a hand vaguely.
