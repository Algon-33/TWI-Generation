The giggling stops abruptly. But the air is suddenly warmer, and the sky brighter. The clearing illuminated by braziers and mage light warms, and it feels as though everything is lit by a subtle glow. I feel the wind blow strong for a second, and smell wet earth, flowers, the smell of nectar, growing grass—
Spring.
Oh, that’s what I was missing. I hear the voices overhead, crystal clear at last. Unearthly voices, voices that rustle and leap with life, the voices made of magic.
 
“Is it time yet?”
“I don’t think so.”
“Are you sure?”
“I think we’re early. We shouldn’t be here!”
“We’ll get in trouble!”
“Let’s go, hurry!”
“Wait!”
“Shh! We’re not supposed to be heard!”
“Shut up! Hey! Hey, remember to tell them to bring lots of sweets!”
“And pudding!”
“And pudding! Sweets and pudding, okay? Remember!”
“Quick, let’s go! Before—”
 
A clamor of quick voices, arguing, talking rapidly and urgently. And then an authoritative voice, singing out above them all.
 
“Too late! It’s time!”
 
I hear laughter. And I look up and smile. The skies open. The nobles gape. Durene looks up and gasps. Lady Rie nearly swallows her tongue. I just laugh as the wind blows and they step downwards, step out of the forests, dance into the meadow. Of course, why would they be cold and frozen in the spring? I look at one of them as they wink and blow me a kiss. They bow, mockingly, and I shake my head.
“Took you long enough.”
 
“Same to you!”
 
And then my banquet really begins as they descend, bringing spring and chaos in their wake. The tricksters, the harbingers of spring and snow. The beings of myth and magic. The Fair Folk.
The fae.
