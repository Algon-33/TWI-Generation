He slammed the blades further into their sheathes. Relc paused. Klbkch was angry. This called for a pep talk. Normally he got talks. But he had to do right by Klbkch. So, think. What would Klbkch say to…Klbkch?
“Look, maybe this is a new problem. But those Ant-guys, they’re new too, right? So they need a bit of teaching. You can do it. I believe in you.”
The Drake held up a thumb-claw and grinned. Klbkch stared at Relc. He went back to walking down the street. Relc strode to catch up.
“I am not their…instructor.”
“You’re a good leader, Klb. What’re you talking about? Zevara’s given you more commendations than anyone else. Guards love you. You’re better at this guarding thing than me.”
The Antinium shook his head. Not denying the truth. That was objectively true.
“That is different. They are not Antinium. The Antinium do not need training. They should not. But these are not True Antinium. They are…wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.”
The muttering bothered Relc. So too did discussing the Antinium. It was one of those things they had never brought up. What happened if a Third Antinium War began. The Drake hesitated. Think, think…
“What’s wrong, Klbkch? The Antinium look pretty good to me. I saw them taking back Liscor during Skinner and during the Goblin Lord. Heck, Face-Eater moths too. The Black Tide! Go! Whoo!”
Some of the people were giving them very odd looks. Relc shifted, awkwardly. Klbkch looked at him.
“They are not True Antinium. Just copies.”
“…Riiiight. Because they’re…worse?”
Relc felt in his belt pouch for something to write on. What had Captain Z told him? If Klbkch ever talked about his Hive, write it down. Not that he had in a decade. This was the first time. But Klbkch was definitely off. The Antinium paused, and muttered.
“They’re all defective. But they were supposed to be restored. Reconnected. But they just broke differently. Even the ones you think of as Antinium are wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong…”
That was five wrong’s. Might be a problem here. Relc cleared his throat.
“Um. How? Soldiers look good. Nightmares on the battlefield, right? I fought some, well, you know how it is. No hard feelings, right?”
He debated another thumbs-up and decided not to. Klbkch looked at him.
“No. They are inferior to True Antinium. Even Soldiers. Soldiers can…break. Flee a battle or lose cohesion. Due to fear.”
Relc paused.
“Yeah. Imagine that. [Soldiers] running away because they don’t want to die? What’s the world coming to?”
“They would never break if they were True Antinium. They would march into hell a thousand times. They were born of it. As was I. These ones would never have survived the corruption.”
A whisper. Relc’s scales crawled. Ancestors, that sounded like an army of the King of Destruction’s best unit, the Dreamers of Reim. He looked at Klbkch.
The Antinium looked like he was breaking. But—his hands were so steady. He looked at Relc for a second, kept walking. The Drake took a second.
There was something dangerous there. Something close to the look Relc had seen in dying [Soldier]’s eyes who wouldn’t stop even when you stabbed them through the heart. The kind of monsters he had met on the battlefield. The reason he had quit.
Not breaking, then. Murderous.
“Klbkch, maybe we need a drink. Why not? You and I have done it a few times. Let’s relax. Take a load off.”
“I have work. Now—and then a patrol tonight.”
“Right, double shift. You took over for Sehsi. Well—er—”
Relc was really trying. But what could you say to Klbkch? His Antinium were all wrong. What could Relc say? ‘Tough luck, buddy?’ ‘Hope they turn out better?’
