And stop losing people. He could not stop it. He thought he was stronger. He had tried. He had sworn not to let it happen again.
Erin was ____. It was his fault. He had been overconfident. If he’d stayed inside. If he hadn’t told Bird to stop so he and Badarrow could compete—
Badarrow knelt next to him. The [Sniper] was crying. But he had Snapjaw, and she had told him she would follow him into the ground if he tried. Numbtongue?
I have seen it. The child needs you. They need you. Stop.
Pyrite’s voice in his head. Numbtongue didn’t hear Shorthilt. But the ghost spoke, again and again. You have to stay. No matter how much it hurts.
Stay for what? To watch them die?
The Hobgoblin did not move. He did not rise. He had nothing to hope for. Kevin said Erin was alive. But—he had not been able to prove it. It was just some…idea from his world.
Earth could not bring back the dead. And magic could not. He had used potions and they had been just water.
He had seen the flame go out. The Hobgoblin knelt. He placed the beautiful sword on the grass in front of him. Then he carefully brought out the beautiful kitchen knife. Her blood was still on the handle. Numbtongue regarded it.
How magnificent. He sighed. Badarrow didn’t notice his friend unsheathing the blade. Numbtongue lifted it—
“Stop.”
Reiss. The [Soulbard] ignored the ghost.
“You have nothing to give me. You could not save her.”
The Goblin Lord had a hand on Numbtongue’s shoulder.
“No. But you still need to listen to me. Listen—”
Numbtongue wanted to close his ears. The Goblin Lord leaned forwards.
“Listen to me. They are wrong, in the inn. They see nothing with magic. No Skills work on Erin. But she is not dead.”
The blade wavered. Badarrow looked up. He lunged. Numbtongue grappled with him. Now—the blade wobbled. He just had to overpower Badarrow for—
“She is not dead! I can prove it.”
The Hobgoblin’s grip wavered. Badarrow tore the blade away and knocked Numbtongue down the hill. He grabbed the sword and ran.
Numbtongue lay on his back. He stared up at Reiss. The Goblin Lord looked down at him.
“Take my hand?”
“No. Just come with me.”
The Goblin Lord walked. And Numbtongue followed. He had to know.

Maviola El was speaking. Burn her. Cremate her. The others were denying it. But it had to be done.
Erin was not—
The door opened. A Hobgoblin stood in the doorway, panting. Badarrow whirled.
“Numbtongue! Stop—”
He raised his fists. But Numbtongue walked past Badarrow, not going for the weapons. He was looking at something in the air.
Maviola’s hair rose slightly, as the Hobgoblin tilted his head. Listening. He looked around.
“Erin…is not dead?”
He said it like a question. The others looked at him. Maviola El shook her head. Another lost child. But—then he looked around.
“You.”
He pointed at Montressa. Then at Falene. Bezale. Palt…and his head turned. Searching. For someone who was not there. It swung back to a point in the air. His ears twitched.
Listening.
“Erin is alive?”
“Ancestors.”
Saliss just looked away. Numbtongue shook his head. He looked around.
“She is not dead.”
“I can see she is not alive, Numbtongue.”
Maviola El snapped. Anger flashing in front of despair. She knew he was in shock, denial. Mrsha just looked at Numbtongue, hoping. It was a cruelty to let the child believe—only to have it dashed.
“I can prove it.”
The inn went silent. Numbtongue looked at Reiss. The Goblin Lord spoke, and Numbtongue repeated. Two voices, speaking together.
“If there is no life—then prove she is dead. [Detect Death].”
