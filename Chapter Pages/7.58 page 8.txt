“Lyonette, you know the party is coming up. This is my last chance. Maviola already told me I wasn’t prepared.”
The [Princess] pointed at Ryoka.
“Wait till winter. Give up on the party for the Summer Solstice. Is there a time limit?”
“No, but—”
“Then wait. It’s not hard. Let it go. Ryoka. Let go of your ego. You can’t do this.”
The Wind Runner stirred.
“But it’s wrong—”
Lyonette threw a pillow at Ryoka. The Wind Runner dodged. She almost laughed, but the [Princess] was on her feet, truly furious. It still felt serious.
“Lyonette—”
“No! Stop making light of this! Stop pretending like there’s not nine in ten odds you die! I could run you through with a sword. You think you can outrun arrows?”
“You don’t know what I have planned!”
Ryoka wasn’t able to stop the flash of anger this time. She stood up as well. Lyonette advanced.
“I should get Garia to stop you. She has a better shot and she wouldn’t dream of it. You are the most selfish person I’ve met, Ryoka Griffin! Don’t you even think about other people?”
She had such good aim with her words. Ryoka flinched. Then she snapped.
“Don’t talk to me about thinking about other people! Don’t you care about those two kids?”
“You don’t even know their names.”
Ryoka ground her teeth. She didn’t have to! It burned her. It had infuriated her the moment she’d heard of it!
Children. Poison. Cowards, taking lives like they didn’t matter. Causing suffering to win. Just like her world.
“I’m going. And you don’t have the right to stop me.”
“Right? You just don’t understand, do you? How are you so blind—”
Lyonette grabbed Ryoka. The City Runner felt a flash of heat. If Lyonette tried to stop her, like Numbtongue, Ryoka would put her in an arm-bar again. She understood why Numbtongue—
A furry cannonball hit Ryoka in the leg. Once more—just like yesterday—Mrsha intervened. She pushed at them.
The two young women broke up. Ryoka stepped back, clenching her right hand. How dare Lyonette say any of that? She—
She looked down. Mrsha was crying.
The anger in Ryoka vanished. She bent down.
“Mrsha, it’s okay. It’s okay. We’re not going to fight—”
She shot a look up at Lyonette. Some of the hostility had faded. The [Princess] was watching. Mrsha held something up as Ryoka reached to pick her up and hug her. She pushed aside Ryoka’s arms.
It was a little note. Ryoka blinked at the piece of paper. She took it. Mrsha went back to Lyonette’s arms. She wiped her face on Lyonette’s dress.
Ryoka looked at Mrsha. Then, she read the card. The handwriting was messy, the ink stained, unlike Mrsha’s other meticulously written notes. But she had written it, because Ryoka had not understood her any other way.
 
Don’t go, Ryoka. I don’t want you to die.
 
The City Runner’s body froze up. She raised her head. And there was Mrsha, crying. Lyonette held her gently.
“You don’t think you’ll die. I’ve seen [Knights] and [Generals]—everyone says the same thing before a battle or quest. Don’t do it. Mrsha needs you. We need you.”
“I—”
Ryoka’s throat constricted. Lyonette looked at her. Then—she stood.
“Mrsha. Go to Selys, or Bird, or Numbtongue, or Erin. Okay?”
Mrsha didn’t want to. She clung to Lyonette, pointing at Ryoka, signing. Lyonette murmured to her.
“I need to say some things to Ryoka, alone. Don’t listen. Please? Mrsha.”
The Gnoll let Lyonette carry her to the door. Lyonette opened it, regarded something just outside, then closed the door. Ryoka didn’t see. She was still sitting, staring at the blotchy card.
