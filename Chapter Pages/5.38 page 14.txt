“I get that. But, see, Halrac, these Goblins are slaves to the Raskghar—”
“Doesn’t matter. They attacked the inn. They’ll do it again if ordered.”
“But—”
“I don’t trust Goblins. I know you do. I can’t stop you, so I don’t try. I’ll eat at your inn, but I won’t trust those Hobs with my back. And I don’t think it’s safe for you to have them under your roof, either. That’s what I believe, but I know you won’t change your mind. So I don’t waste my breath.”
Halrac folded his arms. Erin stared at him and raindrops pattered off her head. The [Scout] stared at her. Erin was the one who looked away.
“We’re not going to agree on this, are we?”
“No. So let’s drop it. Where’s Bird?”
“Inside. Let me speak first. Please.”
Erin opened the door to her inn. Bird looked up happily.
“Miss Erin! Mister Halrac! Is this who I am supposed to meet? Hello, Mister Halrac. You caught my arrow!”
Halrac’s glare could have peeled paint. Erin took a few deep breaths as she walked over.
“Bird, that’s why we’re here. We need to talk about what you did. You shot an arrow at Halrac.”
“Yes. I did. Because Badarrow was shooting at him. But I shot better.”
“Badarrow wasn’t trying to hit Halrac, Bird! And even if he was, that doesn’t excuse what you did!”
The Antinium paused. For the first time his raised mandibles lowered slightly and he looked less happy.
“Oh.”
“You shot an arrow right at Halrac’s chest, Bird. You would have killed him.”
Erin spoke slowly, trying to convey this to Bird. The Worker looked confused. He hunched his shoulders and looked at Halrac.
“But he is Mister Halrac. A Gold-rank adventurer. He wouldn’t die.”
Erin and Halrac exchanged a glance. Bird looked at both of them.
“…Would he?”
They nodded. Bird paused. He seemed to grapple with this. If Badarrow hadn’t been shooting at Halrac…and he had…and Halrac would have died if he’d been shot…Bird looked up suddenly in alarm.
“Did I do bad?”
“Yes!”
The Antinium began to shake. He looked at Erin.
“How bad did I do. Very bad? Very bad?”
Erin’s heart twisted. But she kept a stern face.
“Very bad, Bird. As bad as bad can be. I brought Halrac here so you can apologize. He might not forgive you. That’s how bad it was.”
Bird looked at Halrac, stricken. He wavered, looked around wildly. Erin held her breath. Then Bird curled up. He wrapped his four arms around his body and he began to rock back and forth.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry—”
“Bird? Bird!”
The Antinium didn’t respond. He seemed petrified and kept babbling the same words over and over. Erin went to stop him, but Halrac caught her hand.
“Let me.”
Erin hesitated, then drew back. She took a few steps away as Bird kept rocking back and forth and took several breaths. Someone put a hand on her shoulder and she turned.
“Pawn!”
The Antinium had been watching the entire thing. Pawn stared at Bird. And then he spoke.
“I have known Bird as long as I have been alive. I understand that he is…different. Even for an Individual. What Bird does not understand is why some things are not permissible and why other things are. Would it be appropriate for me to apologize with Bird?”
Erin stared back at Bird and Halrac. The [Scout] had stopped Bird from rocking. His expression didn’t change much, but he spoke quietly to Bird and the Antinium looked up desperately. Erin sensed a flicker of what might have been pity cross Halrac’s face. Or sadness.
“No, Pawn. I think Halrac understands. You should get your Soldiers and Workers back. Thanks so much for the help.”
