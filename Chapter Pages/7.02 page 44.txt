Relc roared as he looked for his spear. Lyonette whirled. On the other side, she saw Bevussa and Issa whirling, looking at the magic door. Then the Garuda took wing. The image followed her up as she flew straight up. Issa was behind her.
“There. Go! Go!”
The view swung down. Kin and Zassil flew after. Lyonette saw the door flicker. Go out. Reappear again as another [Mage] in her inn grabbed the door. She saw herself.
And the Wyverns. They flew. And in The Wandering Inn, as Noass and Sir Relz ran, shouting into the scrying orb, the Wings of Pallass flew. And for once, The Wandering Inn was only witness. They stared, as one of the six Walled Cities fell under attack.
In the silence, Lyonette saw Tersk put the scrying orb on the table. Everyone crowded around it. Or the magic door as it recharged. And only one voice was clearly audible in the silence.
“Ooh. Big birds. I am so very envious.”
Bird stared through the magical door. He looked up at the sky full of Wyverns and then at Lyonette’s pale face. He paused.
“I mean…oh no? Oh no. They did not attack Liscor? Oh no…I mean, yes. This is good.”
Bird paused.
“I am so jealous.”
