“No way. That can’t be Joseph. That just can’t. He didn’t—”
“Wow. That’s something.”
Idis muttered in Geneva’s head. The [Doctor] looked at the blank orb as it flickered to an advertisement. A Drake [Farmer] mopped at his brow and presented the viewers with a large beet. Pallass-grown.
Things were changing. Geneva felt it. She felt…lighter. She looked at the orb and giggled.
“Geneva?”
The sound unnerved Paige. But the [Doctor] just sat there. She thought about ‘Joseph’. And she leaned back.
“That’s why we do these things.”
She closed her eyes. Exhaled. And recalled something she’d learned in medical school. Geneva Scala sat up.
“Huh. I wonder…there’s no issue, is there?”
“What?”
Paige looked at her. Geneva stood up. She glanced around.
“Kirana, can I borrow the kitchen for a moment?”
The [Housekeeper] looked astonished by the request. Geneva had never cooked a thing since coming to this world. But she agreed readily. Geneva walked into the kitchen.
Something simple. She found some eggs. Noodles…she looked around.
“Do you have any cheese?”
“Right here.”
Paige, Siri, and Daly peeked their heads in on the kitchen, watching as Kirana assisted Geneva. But the [Doctor] did most of the work.
“What’s she making?”
“Noodles?”
“Geneva?”
The [Doctor] cracked an egg into a bowl with some pork, fat, black pepper, some cheese that was as close to parmesan as she could get…Kirana hovered around her.
“Eggs in the sauce? Not cream?”
“Are you insane?”
Geneva stared at her. She was making a carbonara, not…trash. She mixed the egg base with some pasta water and the pasta, watching cheese melt. She seasoned, tasted, and pronounced it ‘adequate.’
“I had no idea you could cook.”
Paige blinked at Geneva. The [Doctor] smiled.
“I haven’t had time to before.”
“Do you have time now?”
Geneva made a plate.
“Not at all. But I have to take some time. Here—try it.”
Paige did. Her brows rose.
“That’s good!”
“Thank you. Can someone help me take it?”
“Where to?”
Daly seized the cooking mitts. Geneva looked at him.
“The clinic.”
The others looked confused. The [Doctor] lead the way.
“Don’t they have to eat that electrolyte water?”
“It’s important, yes. But some of them can hold their meals. They’ve not been eating more than bland food. It—might cheer them up.”
The [Doctor] led the way. She entered the clinic and Selphids, [Nurses], and more turned. Geneva put the carbonara in small bowls or plates and passed them around. The patients brightened up. Those that were well enough ate sparingly. But they had been missing taste.
“I didn’t think of it.”
Geneva Scala sat there, in her office, listening to the patients snack in a good mood and compare their favorite foods.
“Think of what, Geneva?”
Idis asked. Geneva shook her head.
“Bedside manner. I thought it was enough to just be…there’s nothing for them to do. They should have books. Entertainment. The walls are drab. That won’t improve their spirits. At least some plants. Flowers. Letters from family members.”
“Huh. But that’s not your job, is it? You don’t need to do that.”
The Selphid pointed out curiously. She felt Geneva smile.
“There’s more to being a [Doctor] than just cutting people open, Idis.”
She’d forgotten that. Now, the [Doctor] sat there. For just a minute. Then she stood.
Healer Demerra had questions for her. One of the patients was doing poorly. Someone had just broken their leg. She had a thousand and one things to do. So Geneva did them. She ran about, so much that Idis was exhausted. Then Geneva Scala went back to her room and fell asleep. Because she needed that too.
