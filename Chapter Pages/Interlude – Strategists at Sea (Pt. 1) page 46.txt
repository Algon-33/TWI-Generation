Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)
Page 46
“Everyone alright? Are uh, all the passengers alright? Wouldn’t want anyone getting hurt.”
The [Pirate] was glancing about, looking at Venaz, Merrik, Peki—everyone was fine. Yerranola had lost an arm, but she’d gotten it back. A few cuts or bites—a ghoul had taken a chunk out of Wil’s arm.
He only felt the pain now. And a healing potion helped regrow the lost skin and muscle. Wil winced as the woman looked around. Her eyes fell on him.
“Aha.”
She winked at another of the crew who’d come over. The Centaur. At sea. The [Sailors] stared as the Centaur stowed the pair of crossbows she’d been using to blow undead to bits.
“Who—just who are you? I mean—thank you for the save. We thought we were goners. But who…”
Mystified, Yerranola looked at the group. She didn’t seem to realize they were [Pirates]. But Captain Lasc hadn’t sheathed his blade.
“Me? I’m just a passing [Captain]. Saw the fog, thought you might be in trouble. [Necromancers], tricky business. Shame I couldn’t recruit—I mean, negotiate. But there you were.”
The woman shook hands with Yerranola, beaming. She had sharp teeth on one side of her face. Wil blinked as she studied him.
“I’m exceptionally grateful, Captain. I am Wil Kallinad, passenger of The Emerald Signet. And you are?”
The [Pirate] focused on Wil. And she grinned wickedly. But then she reached up—felt at her head.
“Where’s my hat?”
“You left it in your bag of holding.”
One of the crew members muttered. He was a Drake and he was armed with a cutlass. He also had wings. He’d flown over.
“You let me fight without my hat? What kind of crew are you?”
The woman complained. She produced a magnificent hat from the bag of holding at her side. She put it on her head. Then—promptly swept it off as she gave Wil a bow.
“Captain Rasea Zecrew. At your service!”
“Rasea?”
The name made Venaz start. The last name made Wil start.
Zecrew? It sounded like a common name. But if you were up on monarchies…
“Lord Kallinad, a few steps back if you please.”
It was Captain Lasc who laid it all to bed. He approached, flanked by Delivan and a squad of [Storm Sailors], including Inky. He was staring hard at Rasea. Warily.
“Captain Rasea. I am Storm Captain Lasc of The Emerald Signet. Do you fly your colors for my ship?”
He gestured at the flag flying above the shining ship. And Rasea turned her head. Wil, backing up, saw the [Sailors] tense. But they looked worried. Alarmed.
Peki elbowed Merrik.
“Who is she? Why does she look like an enemy?”
“Don’t know. Anyone?”
It was Venaz who replied. He and Wil knew the sea. He spoke, slowly.
“Unless I’m wrong, that would be— Captain Rasea Zecrew. [Pirate Captain] of the Illuminary. Rasea the Shining. One of the most feared [Pirates] on the seas.”
The other students inhaled. Rasea grinned broadly. And Wil murmured under his breath.
“And related to Revine Zecrew. The Siren of Savere. The…[Bandit Queen], Revine.”
“Ah. You mean, my big sister.”
Captain Rasea laughed. She looked around the deck. Fearless. Her one eye shone. Captain Lasc looked at her.
“Do you mean to take my ship, Captain Rasea?”
The woman paused. And her eyes twinkled. Like a kind of madness. The person who would sail bright lights through Kraken’s Pass. She reminded Wil a bit of the Professor.
Everyone was tensed. But then—Rasea Zecrew just smiled. She shook her head.
“Not at all! I was just passing by. I saw the fog—wanted to give a hand. We’re not all [Pirates], me and my crew. Can we give you anything? Food? Water? Patch up your sails? Actually—if you lot were wanting to go somewhere, we’d be happy to escort you.”
