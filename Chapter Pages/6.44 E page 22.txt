The [Mage Hunter] snapped as she pointed her wand and shot lightning into the sky. Durene, panting, looked up. Riverfarm was filled with screams. Prost had mobilized Beniar and the [Riders] to hold the entrance to the village. But where was that galloping coming from?
She turned. And then the first [Summer Knight] raced past her. Dame Talia lowered her visor and pointed her sword ahead.
“For the Order of Seasons! House Kallinad and the summer! Charge!”
More riders thundered after her. Knights dressed in the bright of spring, the radiance of summer. They filled the gaps, hacking down the cloth golems as four of the [Summer Knights] charged the cloth giant. Durene caught her breath. She looked at the unconscious [Knight] on her shoulder. The [Hunters] looked at her.
“Miss! Into the village! Do you have anywhere we can use? We can set up a warding spot until Raim wakes up!”
One of the [Hunters] snapped at her. Durene blinked.
“I—yes! This way!”
She led them at a run towards the newest houses. Behind them, the Order of the Seasons was holding Belavierr’s army back. The physical ones, at least. Durene looked up as someone screamed. More spirits were flying lower. And they looked like faces, caught in some madness of grief or rage or insanity—
“Down!”
The [Archer] raised her bow. But the spirits were flying lower, assailing the fleeing Riverfarm people in the street. They dove as the [Hunter] cursed, trying to place her shot. They flew past an old woman with a pointed hat, chasing a child. The [Witch] raised her hand and slapped the spirit.
“[Deft Hand].”
The spirit had no body. But something smacked it into the air. The [Archer] loosed, and the arrow exploded with light. The spirit vanished with a scream. And the [Witch Hunters] looked down.
Eloise straightened her hat as one of the [Summer Knights] thundered back into Riverfarm. Dame Talia’s eyes were blazing. She spotted Eloise, and then did a double-take.
“Another [Witch]?”
“She’s not a target! Hold!”
The [Witch Hunter] with the crossbows halted Talia before she could lower the lance. He turned. But warily. The man looked at Eloise. The grandmotherly [Witch] wasn’t smiling as she regarded the battle outside Riverfarm. Or Ser Raim.
“Lady Eloise du Havin. Where is the Stitch Witch?”
The [Witch Hunter] addressed the [Witch] politely. Eloise looked at him.
“Gone, young man. And I am [Witch] Eloise. I haven’t used that other name in years.”
The [Hunters] tensed. The man with the crossbows paused.
“I see. Does your coven intend to stand with the Stitch Witch, then?”
Eloise paused. She looked around, meeting Durene’s eyes a moment. Then she shook her head.
“My coven will decide whether they stand with her or not. I have already given my answer, but the others have not. Now, let us protect this village. Put the [Knight] in a safe place. He’ll wake soon. He’s just tired. If he means to end Belavierr, he had better do it soon. She will try to kill the [Hunter] who marked her by any means necessary.”
“And if they choose to fight? This coven of yours? What then?”
Talia snapped, still blazing with battle-fever. Eloise glanced up at her. And then she looked at Ser Raim.
“If they do, you had better bring ten times as many of your sisters, Miss Knight.”
Her eyes glinted under her hat.
