I’ll leave you with some amazing art. Maviola El, of course, has been drawn by Cortz, while Lady Pryde herself was captured by pkay, who did her and Magnolia and Wuvren, and Plushie, who did Lady Pryde (and Hawk)! Hope you enjoy, and I’ll see you in a bit.
…And no, I’m not writing the rest of this scene. I mean, should I? Nah. Maybe Mating Rituals Pt. 3.
I joke. This was a romance. I hope you enjoyed it, and thanks for reading!
