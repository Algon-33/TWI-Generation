The enchanted blade wouldn’t have gone through her shields. But the [Clown] had guessed that. So he’d jumped with it. He stabbed, his blades meeting the magical shields, piercing—
“What are you? Whatareyouwhatareyou—”
Silvenia heard his crazed laughter. She pointed and the [Clown] twisted—that saved him. He landed on the wall. The half-Elf blinked at him. Tom dove, dodging her as she shot a bolt of magic that blew a chunk out of the walls. He was quick.
The Gloomless Troupe attacked her. Throwing daggers—the [Archers] aimed at her. A [Piercing Shot] broke one of her shields. The half-Elf didn’t look away from Tom. He slipped as he tried to leap again—and the [Fireball] went wide. He screamed as the flames burned him, but then rolled, drinking the potion. Silvenia blinked—and then smiled.
“Oh, look. A [Hero]. I k-know what to do with you.”
She pointed a finger—Tom saw her eyes flash.
“[Siphon Luck].”
The [Clown]…slowed. He felt something go out of him. He stared up at the half-Elf. And she laughed.
“You must be the [Clown]! Laugh for me, funny man.”
Tom stared up at Silvenia. His mouth worked.
“…What at?”
She clenched a fist and opened it. Tom’s body tore apart. The Gloomless Troupe saw blood and flesh and the tattered clown suit land on the ground.
“Well then.”
Silvenia floated past them. Bazeth stood on the ground. Flora stared up at Silvenia. The half-Elf pointed.
“Advance the real army, Bazeth. Seed the ground.”
“The real army?”
Bazeth’s eyes flickered. The half-Elf was breathing hard.
“Yes. I need to use my mana for this. [Dispel Phantasmal Warriors].”
The Demons—vanished. The faceless, nameless infantry. Silvenia started laughing again. She floated higher.
“Silvenia? What are you going to do?”
She turned. With madness in her eyes.
“You have your orders, Bazeth. Carry them out. Take the soldiers prisoner. Or slaughter them. You need to level. There are some hiding in the walls. I—am going to take 4th Wall.”
“Silvenia!”
But she was flying higher. The half-Elf flew faster, faster—towards 4th Wall. Leaving only the bodies of her foes behind.

No Demons. They had all been illusions. Captain Shellc stared down at his clean sword. He looked up only when he heard the scream.
“Captain! The Demons!”
The Demon [Champion] was pointing. Now—now—at last—the real Demons came. Demon Giants. An army of fifteen thousand, and thirty Giants.
“Damn you!”
The Drake screamed. But Bazeth was advancing. The girl with the gun fired once; the irregulars fell back towards the walls. Richard stared at the battlefield from where he had seen them all dying. Cirille. Tom.
“All—illusions?”
The Demons moved forwards. Bazeth’s order was simple.
“Kill them. Avoid needless casualties. Giants—the frozen baskets. Forwards.”
The Demon Giants strode through the gaps in the wall. Smaller than Callidaz and the last true Giants. Children. Flora saw them bearing huge burdens; they ignored the walls completely, moving past it.
The defenders of Rhir retreated to the broken walls for their last stand. And the Deathless flew on.

Too late. Too slow. His paranoia, his checking of timing—he should have called an army forwards the instant he’d woken up.
And he would have still been too late.
“Hurry, Lord Hayvon.”
That was all Quiteil said. The Bastion-General sat at his desk. And only now did the war-map flicker.
5th Wall disappeared. The [Peerless Logistician General] saw the wall turn into fragmented pieces. Some vanished altogether. Demon units flooded past the walls.
“Bastion-General. The wall—”
