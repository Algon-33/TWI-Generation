“Relc, I am on duty. This can wait. I am not interested in your investment ideas or anything else.”
The Drake was strolling towards him, scratching the back of his head.
“Yeah, I know that, Klbkch. I just need a chat. This can’t wait.”
“Speak, then. We are on duty.”
Relc nodded. He looked at Tkrn.
“Yo, Tkrn.”
“Senior Guardsman Relc.”
The Gnoll tried to give Relc a covert look asking what was going on with Klbkch. But the Drake was just looking around. He patted Tkrn on the shoulder.
“Gonna need you to give us some space, Tkrn, pal. And keep the busybodies from interrupting us. This is just me, off-duty. Having a one-on-one with my man Klb. Got it?”
“Er…yes?”
The Drake nodded in a friendly way. He turned back to Klbkch.
“Heard about the inn. Crazy stuff, Klb.”
He spread his claws. He was indeed off-duty. He didn’t have his spear or armor on. Klbkch stared at him.
“I did what was necessary.”
“Yeah. Well, Erin’s upset, but you know how it is. Gotta do what an Antinium’s gotta do, right?”
“…What do you want, Relc?”
“Oh—I just had a chat with Anand. About fatherhood. You know, I didn’t know all he wanted was for you to let him call you ‘dad’. Not too hard, right?”
“I am not his father, biologically or otherwise.”
“Right. But you could have tried. And the other Individuals, the ones you’re always complaining about—I’m beginning to wonder if, y’know, they’re okay. I know they’re not ‘True Antinium’, whatever that is. But you’re just kicking them all out, like that? Or they die?”
The Antinium was still, his voice emotionless.
“Yes. This does not concern you, Relc. We are partners in our job as [Guardsmen]. Nothing more.”
“Oh, no. Totally agree. I don’t interfere with your Antinium stuff. That’s not why I’m here.”
Relc raised his claws. The Antinium looked at him.
“Why, then?”
He was Klbkch. Klbkch the Slayer. Revelator Klbkch. Senior Guardsman Klbkch. Klbkch of the Centenium. Someone of many faces.
And it was Relc, Senior Guardsman Relc, [Sergeant] Relc, the Gecko of Liscor, and…the last Relc who answered him.
“I’m just here as a dad. A bad one, to another bad one. To have a heart-to-heart. And to give you this.”
He’d been edging towards Klbkch. Now, Relc showed the Antinium a fist. Then he hit Klbkch on the chest.
The crack echoed across the street. Tkrn flinched. He saw Klbkch flying. The Antinium turned in the air, landed on the ground. He caught himself, stared down at the cracked chitin on his chest. Not broken; his body was new.
“Relc.”
His voice was quiet. Relc cracked his neck as he adjusted his stance.
“As I recall, you gave me a smack when I was being an idiot. I never thanked you for it. Thanks. Time for me to repay the favor.”
The Antinium saw the big Drake advance. The street of people at night stared as the two Senior Guards, each beloved in their own way, walked towards each other.
“Walk away, Relc. You will regret it.”
The Antinium was vibrating. He did not reach for his swords. Relc was taller than him. Bigger. But Klbkch was in his new body. And—Tkrn backed away as Relc looked at him.
“Yeah? Well, I regret a lot of things. I should have done this a while back. But I didn’t know how much of an idiot you were being. Hey Klbkch?”
“yEs, rELc?”
The two looked at each other. Relc tensed.
“Today, you kind of suck.”

The shouting attracted Watch Captain Zevara. So did the pounding on her door.
“Watch Captain! Relc and Klbkch are fighting!”
“What!?”
She slammed out of the door. Of all the times for a silly—!
“What did Relc do? Just pull them apart and toss him in the Watch holding cells!”
