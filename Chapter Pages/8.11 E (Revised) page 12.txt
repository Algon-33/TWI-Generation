Three versions of herself. Not changing, but all at once. Like some strange trick-mirror or prism that let you see all three compounded into a single body. Three in one. Three of one.
Then Shauna again. Only, Shauna Solstice from her pictures, young, wearing the fashions of her youth. And Shauna as Erin had never seen her, older than her grandmother had been. All three at once, embodied in a single face.
Three Shaunas, like the Erins, in youth, in her middling years, and in her late age.
“What—what—”
Erin nearly crawled onto the computer’s desk to get back. The stranger just looked at her.
“How?”
Her voice was a mix of old, young, and middling. It was not Shauna Solstice’s voice. Not in tone, or intonation. There was imperiousness there. More than a parent wielded. Terrible authority.
Kindness too. At least, the kindness from one side. It was not kindness to Erin to hear it.
“Wh—what?”
The world shifted. And Erin remembered it all. She gasped.
The many times she’d ‘returned’ to Earth were a blur in her memory. She faintly recalled each false narrative, the details blurring together But her life? Her death?
She remembered that, and had realized the artifice of this place each time. She looked up.
The stranger stood before her. Wearing her mother’s face. She looked at Erin. And a mix of emotions warred across her expression.
Curiosity. Annoyance. Disappointment? She spoke once more.
“Each time, no matter how cunningly woven, you break out. You find the gap and tear it apart. How? Are we still so weak? No. It is something else. Willpower is not enough. Even when you do not remember, something informs you. What flaw is it? Tell me.”
“Who are—?”
“Tell me.”
The word shook everything. It was like Erin’s bones and soul vibrated. She flinched and the words tumbled forth.
“I—can tell what’s real and what’s not! The Spirited Generation—the pandemic—all the news and even the music. That’s real, isn’t it? But not us coming back. Not me bringing back artifacts. Not…this.”
Erin gestured at the open windows on her computer. The stranger looked dismissively around.
“Yes. Your memory is here. And history is here. Enough to make all this to see what you would do. What you are. And you do nothing. You sit about, you play…games…and you eat and sleep. Nothing more. If you are thrust into great places, you do not act different.”
“I broke out of a government lab once.”
‘Shauna’ ignored that. She looked at Erin.
“You do not speak with the conviction of saints. You do not lead nations. You are not capable of wisdom or knowledge—if you were, they would have claimed you. Nor are you a great warrior. You have not withstood pain beyond any other. You are…normal.”
“Hey! I’ve had pain and stuff.”
Erin bristled. The eyes pierced her.
“Yes. You have known love and loss and you play games. You are…ordinary. That is what disappoints me.”
“Well…yeah. Why?”
A sigh.
“I thought you would be greater.”
Erin realized the hallway was gone. Her room, this woman, and only a few things were left. Everything else was oblivion.
Not white space. Not a trippy flat landscape of nothingness.
The world simply ended around her. And nothing more was here. The woman stared at her.
“…Who are you?”
“My name, child, is Kasigna. I thought you would be so much more. But you are not. You are the first of them. The children. And you are just…Erin.”
Kasigna walked out of Shauna. Erin’s mother vanished and now she was another woman. She walked through oblivion, staring at Erin, trapped in a figment made of memory and reality.
