He nodded, teary-eyed.
“I—he always swore he’d rather die in the saddle than alone. Mind you, I don’t think he’d have desired it too much. But it was something.”
Erin nodded. Half-shook her head.
“He would never have died alone.”
The man paused. She was looking at him. His grip weakened.
“True enough, milady.”
“I’m not a [Lady].”
Erin shook her head. The retainer looked at her oddly. But then he bowed slightly and stepped back.
“Miss Erin Solstice. Was that…your Skill?”
“Yes. I’m sorry if it…”
Erin found herself speaking to a [Lord]. Not one she remembered directly. He had been at the riots too. He shook his head.
“It was—appropriate. Momentous. I thank you.”
“I’m glad. Lord Ranga, right?”
He nodded. Erin heard laughter. She turned. Someone was telling a story of Lord Toldos. They left his remains behind. Trying to capture the man, explain him with words.
His mansion would be filled. The streets of his town filled with people from the wake, celebrating it in their own way.
Erin wiped her eyes again. Lord Ranga looked away, as if they were something to be ashamed of.
She hadn’t known she could use [Immortal Moment] like that. She’d just…felt it. And it wasn’t as if she had used it on every person there.
Just on one man. One moment.
She was getting stronger. What a way to find it out. What a…
Useless Skill? No. The most important Skill in the world. Just not one that fit battlefields or fantastical scenes.
A Skill for a funeral. The [Mortician] had shaken Erin’s hand and thanked her for it. She thought of that class with more respect than she ever had before—not that she had thought of someone whose job it was to tend to the dead.
What an important job. Erin took another breath. She let it out. And realized Lord Ranga had said something.
Goodbye, Lord Toldos. I will see you again. And never. I wish—
Then Erin looked up.
“What was that, Lord Ranga?”
“…I said, I should be delighted if you visited House Owe. I believe Alman has tendered the same invitation? Certainly, it would be an honor. Have you met my son?”
Erin recognized the impetuous young [Lord]. She eyed Lord Ranga. Then she shook her head.
“Maybe in a bit, Lord Ranga. But there’s somewhere I have to be.”
“Well, I didn’t mean directly after this—”
The [Lord] looked slightly affronted. Erin clarified.
“No, I’m grateful for the invitation. It’s just—I have somewhere to be soon. Very soon. Actually—”
It was time. She looked up at Lord Ranga.
“—Have you heard about what’s happening on the Summer Solstice?”
He blinked.
“The Summer…ah. Do you mean the event in…where was it…Riverfarm? I did receive an invitation, but I thought it was far too late—and far.”
“Mm. What about with a magic door?”
The man looked struck for a moment.
“I hadn’t considered it—mind you, I hadn’t any desire to return to Invrisil. Say. Could I just walk through to visit House Sanito?”
“…Yeah? Wait, how did you get here?”
“We rode. It took two—and that door would have brought us through?”
Erin eyed Lord Ranga and took a long slurp from her drink. The man colored slightly in the meaningful silence. She threw him a bone.
“Don’t worry, I made the same mistake before I realized how to use it. Yes! Lyonette mostly sends through goods, doesn’t she?”
“The young woman? Er—yes. We have a shipment of nails from Esthelm, very cheap—very convenient! Lord Alman! Alman, Edere! Listen to this—”
Ranga practically dragged Erin over. Alman’s expression was much like Erin’s own.
“You rode here, Ranga?”
“Yes, I—wait. How did you get here, Alman?”
