Vibrant, just, beautiful hair. Blue hair. Well, not blue…azure was a better color. And that voice.
Ryoka Griffin turned and saw a Human woman tucking the sculpture away. She turned. And her eyes were only one color—a pale pink. She stared at Ryoka as she lifted the glass to her lips.
“Oh. Hello.”
“X—”
The Human woman smiled at her. Ryoka stared. She was here? Xrn tilted her head, just like she would have as an Antinium.
“It is the hair, isn’t it? No one else noticed, however.”
“How? You can shapeshift? Is it an illusion or—”
The Small Queen smiled. It was an unfamiliar expression on her face, as if she didn’t know how to make all the muscles work.
“Is it so surprising? I am a magic-user. Of course I can hide.”
“I didn’t know—I’ve never heard of you doing it.”
“Of course not. If you did, everyone would always be so careful. This is good food. Would you like a shrimp? I did not think Humans ate bugs. But I am much entertained. I will take some food back for the Antinium.”
Ryoka looked around. But Xrn’s comments were lost in the chaos. Kevin, Leon, and Troy were staring at a contortionist—a Naga. Which was either cheating or brilliant.
“This is insane. Do you do this often? The Walled Cities?”
“No it is not insane. Sometimes, and not in the Walled Cities. It is too dangerous if I were found out. But Invrisil is fine. At least, with a magic door so close by.”
Xrn took a swallow of food and bit the shrimp’s head off. Ryoka watched her crunch happily.
“How? Is this your magic?”
“Yes. Why are you so surprised at what I can do, Ryoka? I told you. I am a [Thaumaturge].”
“I don’t see how you can do so much. None of the other Wistram [Mages] can do what you can. It’s like—”
Teriarch’s magic. Ryoka bit her lip on that. Xrn’s eyes twinkled. They changed color to bright gold. She answered as she found a tray of some kind of delicate sugar glass spiders…which were walking about. Only Jelaqua and a few others like Numbtongue had tried them. Xrn began shoving them into a bag of holding without a moment’s hesitation. She answered Ryoka as one of the [Waiters] stared at her, then hurried into the kitchen.
“I do not cast magic the same way as [Mages]. Because my method and understanding is like red and blue.”
Not night and day or some other analogy? Ryoka hesitated.
“Some similarities?”
Xrn twinkled at her.
“Yes. Magic is not like how they understand it for me. Because I am different.”
“In what way?”
The Antinium sighed. She pointed upwards.
“What do you think I see, Ryoka Griffin? I see how magic flows. I see how to use it. I see what other [Mages] have yet to learn. Ooh. What is that?”
She stared at one of the salt-geese and hurried over. Ryoka pursued.
“But that doesn’t explain—you can cast any spell you want to, or so it seems. How do you just make spells?”
Xrn considered that as she nibbled on some salt. She gestured with her hands.
“I think it is the misconception of magic of other spellcasters in how they use it. For them, spells are boxes you fill with the right things. You can adjust the box. But boxes they remain. I treat magic how I please. If I need a box—I make a box. This should not surprise you, though. You use wind magic like I do.”
She looked at Ryoka. The Wind Runner blinked.
“I do?”
“Of course you do. Or rather…the wind moves because of you. Interesting, interesting. I did not notice that. You’re not doing it. Magic shapes itself because you are there. Interesting. I have seen that before.”
Xrn peered at Ryoka. Then lost interest.
