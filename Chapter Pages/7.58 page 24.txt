Death. Erin nodded. She strolled over to something in the man’s office.
“So you’re a Watch Captain—not the Watch Commander. But you can raise the alarm, huh? With this horn? Is it a signal or just one thing?”
“Oh, you’d blow it four times. But please don’t touch—”
Erin picked up the enchanted horn. The Watch Captain hesitated as she lifted it to her lips. Then she looked around.
“Oops. Window.”
“Miss. Miss, what are you—”
Erin blew the horn before he could get out of his chair. Four times. It was loud. Emme clapped her hands to her ears. It rang throughout the city. Citizens looked up. That was—they began to run for the nearest door.
To help them out, Erin leaned out of the window. She’d asked Emme what was appropriate.
“A Flesh Giant is attacking the city! Five of them! Get inside!”
Someone in the streets looked up in horror. They stopped, stared at Erin, and then ran, screaming. Then she turned.
The Watch Captain was frozen with sheer horror. Also, an internal vision of his job evaporating. She handed the horn to him. He moved to grab her.
Erin drew her knife. The man recoiled. She plucked a jar of acid from her belt.
“Stay here, Emme. It’s time.”
“Erin—”
The [Innkeeper] walked down the stairs.

The Brothers dropped their hats. They stopped humming the rhyme. The other gangs stared, transfixed. They couldn’t be serious. But you know what they said about the Brothers. They were properly mad.
Wilovan brought up his club. The [Rogue] raised his crossbow like a shield.
The Gnoll brought down the club. The broken crossbow fell. So did what remained of the man.
“Reinforcements!”
The [Assassin] snapped into a speaking stone. She drew her blade as Ryoka struggled up to her feet. The gangs were split. Half were fighting, the other half running. The Brothers advanced. Crimshaw and another man grabbed one of the [Thugs] and ran him into a shop’s glass window. Then they shoved him onto the broken glass.
“Thirty of them! I need Faces! Get me—”
The [Assassin] dodged Ryoka’s punch. She slashed back as Ryoka threw a handful of sand and caltrops in her face. Ryoka fumbled for a wand as the [Assassin] flipped backwards. She landed as one of the [Thugs] whirled, bringing a crossbow up.
Delanay fired first as he struggled free of his captors. The man went over sideways. Ryoka aimed her wand. The [Assassin] was slashing wildly, half-blinded.
“[Arrow of Fire]!”
The jet of searing light flashed forwards. The [Assassin] twisted.
[Automatic Dodge]. Ryoka’s jaw dropped. The woman leapt, cutting—
She vanished. Fierre tackled her out of the air and they crashed onto the street. The [Assassin] shouted in surprise. She stabbed Fierre three times. The Vampire girl threw her through a wall. Not glass. Brick. She jumped after her.
“What’s—”
Ryoka looked around. And she heard more shouting.

“[Detect Life]. [Quake] spell. Good city-fighting tactics.”
Grimalkin made a note. Olesm pointed. The [Assassins] below were trying to regroup. The Drakes kneeling with crossbows were reloading too slowly. He bellowed.
“[Instantaneous Barrage]!”
A second wave of arrows lanced downwards, perfectly striking a dozen [Assassins]. They stared down at the phantom arrows, ghosts of the bolts. The Drakes looked up as the [Strategist] pointed.
“Mark your targets! Aim! Volley!”
They loosed. The guests of the inn looked up as the Drake force reloaded, and then moved back. Olesm looked around.
“Who is the ranking officer here?”
“That would be me and Commander Relun.”
Grimalkin spoke. The Sinew Magus and a Dullahan stood with Olesm. The Pallassian officer threw a salute.
