Mating Rituals Pt.2

The young woman from Earth opened and closed her mouth. Drassi just blinked at her innocently.
No—not even innocently. She just looked blank. What was the problem here? Erin hesitated.
“Well—okay. But it’s still not something we need to talk about, right?”
“Not if we don’t want to. But seriously, Erin. Are you…stressed? Because if Krshia’s right—”
“I’m fine!”
“So you do use the dildos she says she keeps giving you?”
Erin was practicing her guppy impersonations. Her mouth kept opening and shutting.
“I—don’t have to answer that!”
Selys looked serious.
“Erin, we’re not judging. It’s normal. But seriously—you talk about periods and using the outhouse and you get nervous about the idea of sex?”
“I’m totally fine with it! Anyone can have sex! Relc had sex just the other day! I think!”
Erin threw her hands up. Drassi leaned over.
“Really? With who? That Garuda [Guardswoman]?”
“It’s private! He didn’t need to tell me and I didn’t need to ask!”
Erin glared at Drassi, trying to forget she’d been bugging Relc about that exact thing. Selys raised her brows.
“Good for Relc. He deserves it. Poor guy would have trouble with Drake women, although he’s popular even if he’s a bit…”
“Ugly?”
“Drassi, be nice.”
“I’m not being mean! I like Relc! I’d give him a try if I thought it wouldn’t make things weird.”
Sometimes Erin didn’t understand Drake aesthetics. Relc looked fine to her. But she found the conversation pivoting back to her again.
“All I’m saying is that I have no problem with Relc hooking up, Erin. It’s natural. Nothing to be ashamed of, even if Embria objects. Well…she is his daughter.”
Selys paused. Erin fidgeted.
“I know that. And I’m not judging.”
“Good. So…have you had sex at all since the last time Krshia and I talked to you?”
“I don’t need to answer that.”
“…Have you masturbated?”
“Selys.”
“Erin, I think you might be stressed.”
“Pent up.”
“It’s okay to want to have a good time.”
“Roll around on the carpet with some fun guy. Oh wait, Humans get rug-burns.”
“Even relieve yourself now and then.”
“Hey, can Humans use their hands? I’ve been debating with some of my friends about that. Because we have claws with you know, talons. And if you slip—”
“Drassi, please.”
The [Gossip] subsided, but she and Selys both looked amused. Erin did not want to be at the table with them. She folded her arms, like a bulwark against all things erotic.
“It’s personal.”
Selys recognized the signs of a stubborn Erin coming on. She rolled her eyes, exasperated.
“If you don’t want to talk about it, fine. But we’re just talking to you—as friends—about whether you’re happy. Honestly. We wouldn’t want to do anything. But if you’re frustrated…”
That was all she said. And she gave Erin a serious look. So much so that the [Innkeeper] realized that Selys wasn’t making fun of her. Not really. Erin slowly uncrossed her arms.
“I…well…it’s not necessary.”
“No, but it’s fun.”
“You could get pregnant.”
“From a Drake or Gnoll, Erin? And there are potions for that. Actually—I think I have my answer. Dead gods. How long has it been, six months? That’s a long time for…and nothing else?”
“Wow.”
Drassi gave Erin an almost admiring look. The [Innkeeper] didn’t like the look. She glared, went on the offensive.
“Well, what about you, Selys? Have you had sex? Or you, Drassi?”
The two Drakes blinked. They looked at each other. Drassi paused, and then shrugged.
“Well, I lost my last boyfriend during a fight two weeks back, but I’m not hurting for company, you know? I’m fine.”
“And I had sex yesterday. In my apartments.”
Selys stared at Erin. The young woman blinked.
“What?”
