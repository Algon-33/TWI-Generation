Interlude – A Meeting of [Druids]

Mrsha almost did. She narrowed her eyes. Shassa felt her wariness and hurried to explain.
“I am sorry. But I came here. I was told this was a shortcut around the Bloodfields, but—I was not used to Pallass! Too many people. Too much noise. And then I was here and I felt this.”
She shuddered. Mrsha almost felt her confusion, being lost. The Gnoll nodded. The Drake bent.
“I am…ah, a bit lost. I was told I could go to Invrisil, you see. By magic? But I went through one door and I did not see the other.”
The little Gnoll rolled her eyes. Visitors. They never listened. They were so—
She caught the Drake woman frowning at her.
“I did listen! What? The door goes to Invrisil? Well—that Drake didn’t explain fully!”
It must have been one of the new staff members. Mrsha huffed. Lyonette had hired a new batch and they kept making mistakes. Shassa’s eyes flickered.
“Oh. I see. So the door goes to Invrisil? Six silver?”
She felt at her pouch.
“Hm. Well, I have that. Thank you, little friend. I am in your debt.”
She bowed. Mrsha felt quite pleased at this and nodded. Shassa laughed and the two relaxed. The Drake turned, heading back the way she’d come.
“I am on a mission for my city. Thank you, wild-friend. If time permits, I will call on you. With permission!”
She spoke sidelong to Mrsha. The Gnoll looked up, entranced by this peerless method of communication. She tugged on Shassa’s leg. Wait! Stay a while! No one had ever understood Mrsha like this, not even Urksh or Ryoka! How did Shassa understand? Who was she?
Mrsha felt like she should know. And the Drake’s eyes certainly crinkled up. Then she frowned.
“Dear Mrsha, has no one taught you of your class? How can you not know me?”
She listened. The Drake and Gnoll stood there, as voices floated down from the hill and Drassi’s sleepy one replied, then began to wake up. Shassa frowned.
“What’s that? Really? By yourself? How extraordinary! And so young!”
Mrsha nodded proudly and then frowned at the implicit slight. Shassa laughed, and it was a merry sound.
“I apologize, Mrsha! You are no doubt quite talented. I should explain—I will explain! You see, you have entered with a pact. You are a Tribal Gnoll, aren’t you? They are granted the honors far more than City Gnolls. But you must have met with a sign. Some great event of nature.”
The Frost Faeries. The Goblin Lord. Shassa’s face froze. Her head dipped with shock, then sorrow.
“Oh. Little one. You have seen such terrible things. But this class—listen to me. You are one of us. I go now to meet a great keeper. In Invrisil. But upon my return, I promise you—”
“Mrsha! Who is that?”
A voice rang out from the top of the hill. Mrsha and Shassa spun. Drassi, bleary-eyed and followed by Ekirra and Visma, stared down at Shassa. She of course, knew everyone allowed in the [Garden of Sanctuary], like Mrsha. She did not know Shassa.
“Hey! You! Get away from Mrsha!”
The clear alarm and fear in Drassi’s tone caused the older Drake to back up. Shassa held up her staff and free hand.
“I am sorry! I wasn’t aware—”
“Mrsha, get back! Where’s Numbtongue? Erin, Erin!”
Drassi began shouting. Alarmed, Shassa fled towards the door. Mrsha wavered. She tried to wave her arms, explain, but Drassi couldn’t read her thoughts.
Shassa fled into the inn. Drassi’s shouting followed her. Mrsha ran through the doorway as the Drake sprinted down the hill.
“Lyonette! Numbtongue! Help! She was in the garden!”
Heads turned in the common room of the inn. Shassa looked around.
“No—I was just lost! I—”
