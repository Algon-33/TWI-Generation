Erin saw Numbtongue’s head rise, and then fall. The [Bard] was snoozing. And because Erin wasn’t the new, amazing thing, he let Badarrow get up. The [Sniper] ascended the hill as Erin turned towards him.
“Badarrow.”
“Erin.”
They looked at each other for a long while. In the rush of, well, everything, his arrival had been slightly overshadowed. Not entirely, but it was still something to see him standing there. He looked at her like a long-lost friend. Uncertain of what to say.
Erin knew what to say.
“Want something to eat? Take a seat, take a seat! Did you have breakfast?”
Badarrow sat cross-legged. He smiled as Erin indicated her plate.
“Had food. Good…”
He tried to think of the word.
“Thick soup.”
“Porridge?”
He shook his head.
“Tasty thick soup. Dark skin cook make. Say from home.”
“Oh. Imani’s porridges. Yeah, they’re more savory. Like, made out of pureed beans.”
“What that? Bug?”
The [Sniper] was alarmed by the word ‘pureed’ for a second. Erin laughed.
“No, it’s fine! Its regular beans. Not bugs. She just blends it all up really smooth. That’s probably what you ate.”
“Oh. Yes. Good. Pureed soup. Ate lots. Too many Humans so—”
He waved at the Garden. Erin laughed. She took a bite of her breakfast—she was starving. 
“That’s great. I didn’t know you sunbathed, though!”
“At Goblinhome. High Passes cold. So—Goblins lie in sun when sun out.”
“What? No way! You do it like that?”
“No. Furs. Wrap up like…”
He gestured. Erin had forgotten that Badarrow was the least-talkative, but he had no choice with her. And his diction was much improved! Snapjaw?
“Watch out for Razorbeaks or Wyverns, but warm. Also, wrap up next to big fire. With Carn Wolf at night. Lots of Goblins.”
“You all snuggle together?”
The [Innkeeper] was delighted. Badarrow hesitated. She was probably right, but he disliked how she said it for some reason he couldn’t explain.
“Sit together for warm.”
He corrected her. Erin laughed.
“Call it what you like. But that’s so great! So…I’m glad you’re okay.”
She’d locked them in here during the battle. But they’d gotten out and fought near the end. Badarrow gazed at Erin.
“Lots of fighting. Lots of Humans. [Assassins]. Entire city fighting.”
Because of you. He looked at Erin. And the day’s events became realer in her mind. She ran a hand through her hair.
“Has anyone found Maviola? Saliss?”
He shrugged. The Hobgoblin didn’t know who they were, not having met them for long enough.
“I’ll ask. I’m just glad…you three are okay. It was something.”
“Yes.”
“Heck of a Tuesday, huh? Wait till next week.”
The [Archer] blinked at Erin. Then he narrowed his eyes. Erin kept her face straight. The Hob hesitated, then reached out and shoved her slightly.
“Lie.”
“You got me!”
Erin giggled with laughter. Badarrow relaxed. The [Innkeeper] sat with him, offering the Hob some of her bacon, asking how he’d slept, in peace while her inn buzzed.
A shape in the large pond made Erin turn. She saw a huge Fortress Beaver and some kits surface, their large dam and some fish the residents of that area of her garden. And then—a rather wet, giant, white fish beached itself.
Mrsha the Fish had been swimming around in the pond, hiding in the dam from the wrath of adults. Now she galloped up the hill, charging at Erin.
“Oh no you don’t! No, Mrsha—”
She was going to tackle Erin and then shake herself dry! The [Innkeeper] was serious this time! She did not need this! But Mrsha was filled with too much energy—and perhaps, worry. She was the ruiner of clothes! The bringer of baths! The—
