Someone spoke, from a dais in Liscor. To a crowd of thousands, his words repeated by countless more. They filled the plaza.
“Today, fools killed the greatest treasure our city has ever known.”
Lism’s eyes were red. He looked, and they all looked with him. Towards the walls. And what lay beyond. The inn.
“Not the woman herself. Not just her. But what she represented. What she became. Every step, every life which met with hers, every meal and Skill and day made our city better. She was—”
He stopped. His throat worked. The [Councilmember] said nothing more. He stepped away, shaking.
“Enough. There is nothing else to say. This goes beyond mere crime. Beyond offense. Strategist Olesm—your words?”
The [Strategist] stirred. He had not shed a tear. He had not—the ghost of a Drake moved. He looked away from the inn. He spoke. He shouted. He screamed.
“For the [Innkeeper] of Liscor. To war!”
The army moved. Zevara watched from the battlements, head bowed. Below her, the Watch of Liscor marched, their numbers swelled by nearly fourteen thousand volunteers. Menolit marched next to Moore.

They left the city. The stream slowed as night fell. More came. They spoke. They wept. They raged. They made all the sounds in the world.
But not the small group in the inn.
They said nothing. There were no words in any language. Not enough, not for this.
A little Gnoll sat, fur pale as the colors of death. Stained crimson with blood in places. Unmoving.
The [Priest] had torn at himself until he was held down. Lyonette hugged Pawn to keep him from doing himself more harm.
Bird had stopped moving. He lay on the ground.
The children of Earth held each other. Faces in their hands. Weeping.
Badarrow and Snapjaw surrounded Numbtongue. Badarrow was weeping too hard to see. Numbtongue was holding the knife. Holding his sword. Snapjaw’s claws strained as she held him still.
Octavia had removed her face in her shop. She plucked at her strings, as if trying to remove her heart.
Silveran. Ishkr. Drassi—the Players of Liscor held Temile, who had collapsed without a word. Palt had nearly broken his back hooves, kicking at the wall. Blood trickled onto the floorboards, next to Montressa. Bezale, slumped.
In the prison, a Minotaur broke the walls of his cell. He saw the magic break. He walked towards the inn, stumbling, holding two little friends, who clung to his horns.
This world ends. Numbtongue stared at the blade. It ends. 
Reiss held him back. Pyrite. Shorthilt. The Goblin Lord looked at him.
“I cannot bring her back the way you want. Wait. Please. Wait.”
The [Bard] strained. But the ghost held him still.
He saw a figure stir. Lyonette looked up. She spoke, into the void.
“She’s not dead. She’s not dead. Not yet. Say it again, Kevin.”
The figures in the inn turned. The young man’s head rose. He looked around, his eyes red with grief. His throat was raw.
“…It’s beyond our world. I’ve never heard of anyone actually being revived. But with magic—there’s a chance. That’s all I could think of.”
“You froze her.”
“Her body. If you could mend the damage—maybe.”
“Maybe?”
He shuddered. Trying to explain. The others tried to understand.
“If—there’s a chance you could bring her back. Her heart’s stopped. But her brain’s there. Her—”
“Is she there?”
“I don’t know. I’m sorry. It’s all I could think of.”
“The antidote. I could make it. Saliss—someone.”
Octavia looked up. Pawn stirred.
“I will—I was not here. I was not here. I was too weak. I tried. I am—nothing. I have wasted all she gave me. Heaven—what is heaven in any world without her?”
“Pawn. But she lost blood—”
