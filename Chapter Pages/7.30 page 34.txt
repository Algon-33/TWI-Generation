“Of course not. Why would he? No one knew. Only someone from your world would have. Why are you so angry at him for not seeing through a cunning trick?”
“I—but he was wrong.”
“But he didn’t know.”
Erin bit her lip and fell silent. Maviola shook her head.
“You’re rather stubborn. And opinionated, Erin Solstice. Rather like me. It’s a disturbing parallel. I wish you weren’t so much my clone. Well—we vary in some ways.”
“I’m your clone? Waitaminute. Hey! I’m not that stubborn! I just have convictions!”
Erin protested and hurried after Maviola. They arrived at their destination after some light bickering. Maviola pushed into the busy guild, which had a double line of Human [Guards], arguing with Erin.
“All I’m saying is that giving is part of negotiations. You refuse to compromise at times. I saw that.”
“I’m flexible!”
“Yes…of course you are…excuse me! A message to Master Hedault, please! He’s still working in Invrisil, isn’t he?”
The [Scribe] at the front desk glanced up at Maviola. He wasn’t having a good day and his tone was rather brusque.
“Yes, Miss. He is. But I’d advise you to go to the Runner’s Guild for any messages.”
“But he is a member of the Mage’s Guild, isn’t he? You have a direct way to contact him. Street Runner messages tend to get lumped together or ignored depending on how important the client is, Erin.”
Maviola half-spoke to Erin. The [Scribe] sighed.
“We do not just deliver messages for our members, Miss…?”
“El. Lady El.”
The [Scribe] dropped his quill. Heads turned across the Mage’s Guild. Maviola stood there, in her casual clothing as the [Scribe] blinked at her.
“L-Lady El? Of the…”
“That’s right. Of the House of El. Need you a truth spell or will you take me at my word?”
Maviola drew herself up. Erin narrowed her eyes. A touch of her aura. But it was mostly the way she held herself. The [Lady] looked at the [Scribe] as he stammered.
“Of course not, Lady El—how can I serve you? Deepest apologies. Did you say Master Hedault?”
“Yes. Inform Master Hedault that I would like my friend to use his services. Miss Erin Solstice of The Wandering Inn. She has a connection as well through the Horns of Hammerad, isn’t that right, Erin?”
“Uh, yes. Hi. I’m Erin.”
The young woman waved at the [Scribe]. He wrote frantically.
“Very good, Lady El. I will have it delivered forthwith. Master Hedault may not reply—he is a peculiar personage—”
“He will for me. House El is acquainted with him and he knows that. Moreover, Miss Solstice owns the magical door. I’m sure you’ve heard of it? Master Hedault will see Miss Solstice soon—have the message sent to Liscor’s Mage’s Guild and then to The Wandering Inn. They will know where it is.”
“Absolutely, Lady El.”
“Good. For your time.”
Maviola put several silvers on the counter. The [Scribe] bowed and she swept out. Erin nearly forgot to follow her.
“Whoa! That was—”
That was like her! But Erin didn’t say that. Maviola had done it in a different way; Erin would have just dropped names. Maviola glanced at Erin.
“You always have to use names to get ahead or you’d be waiting forever, Erin. And that’s how you schedule an appointment. By the end of the week, you’ll get to see Master Hedault. Sooner, I should think. Don’t worry about the payment; if there is any, it will go to House El. They owe me that much. Although—do you have a gold coin?”
“Um. Yes. Do I give it to the [Scribe]?”
Erin dug one out. Maviola blinked at her.
“Scribe? No, I tipped him. This is for me. Tuition fee and for the tip I gave.”
She took the gold coin. Erin blinked at it.
“But you gave him five silver.”
“Mhm. And?”
