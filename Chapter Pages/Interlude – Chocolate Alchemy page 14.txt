Interlude – Chocolate Alchemy
Page 14
“Alchemy. I know, I know. It’s a complex process. I don’t expect you to get the nuance.”
“Throwing it against the wall? Stomping on it?”
“I was mad. Also, shouting at your potions helps. That’s obvious.”
Saliss sat up and grinned at Erin. She stared at him. The [Alchemist] shook his head wearily.
“I’ve been working on that potion for eight hours. And I failed six times. I get to be mad! Hi. You’re Erin. I’m Saliss. How can I help you? Also—how did you find my bell? Did Xif tell you?”
“No. I saw it.”
“What? But no one ever looks. Ooh. Clever. So what did you come here for, Miss Erin Solstice with the interesting inn?”
The Drake grinned at her. Now he was done, he seemed to be returning to his normal self. He’d always been, well, Saliss, but Erin had seen him focused like a laser on the potion. Now, he was relaxed and cheerful. She only remembered the bag of chocolate when he began sniffing.
“Is that food? I haven’t eaten in…day…days.”
Erin slowly held out the bag. It was time to engage obfuscation mode.
“Chocolate.”
“Hm?”
“Chocolate.”
Erin stared at Saliss. He stared back. For a second she thought she saw him frown, then he gave her the same look. He stared at the bag, and nodded.
“Chocolate.”
Erin hesitated. That wasn’t what he was supposed to do. She tried again.
“Chocolate.”
“Chocolate.”
“Chocolate.”
“Chocolate?”
“Chocolate!”
“Chocolate.”
“Chocolate.”
“Chocolate-chocolate.”
“Alright, fine, it’s chocolate. It’s a food! I brought it to you. I was sort of hoping we could talk.”
Erin threw her hands up. Saliss grinned. He sprang to his feet from the ground with incredible athleticism.
“Great! I was just about to visit you, actually! I’d like more fire, or the flowers. Or just entertainment. Can I get all three?”
Erin blinked at him. She opened her mouth.
“Wait, I came to you to get help! I mean, this is a bribe.”
“Ooh. Can I have some? Hey, this looks like poo! No, wait, I tell a lie. Not what comes out of me. Sugary.”
Saliss closed his eyes. He savored one piece, gobbled three more in quick succession. Erin began to have regrets.
First, coming here. Second, how this conversation had begun. Third—she was wondering what Saliss of Lights would look like on a sugar-high.
Erin caught the Drake looking at her sidelong. Saliss grinned on his fourth piece of chocolate, biting it in half. Then he offered Erin the bag.
“Want a piece yourself? This is really good. I don’t remember having this. Is it completely new?”
“Sort of. It’s from Baleros. But I have a tree in my garden—I’m fine, thanks.”
“Sure. This is really good, but I’ll save it. So this is a bribe?”
Erin hesitated. That had slipped out. She nodded slowly.
“That’s right. I’m bribing you. Uh…can I have some of your potions?”
She gave him a big smile. Saliss paused.
“Why? You want to blow someone up. Trust me, you could just hire a Gold-rank adventurer to do that for less than what my potions cost.”
The young woman squirmed in her seat. And she realized Saliss had sat in this very spot buck-naked probably thousands of times. She wondered if that was actually horrible. Seats were seats.
“Uh, well, I was hoping I’d get some for free.”
“Why?”
“Because…I asked nicely? And because I’ll give you more chocolate?”
The Named Adventurer paused. He looked at the chocolate. Erin was ready for him to ask if a potion was worth a bag of chocolate. But he just grinned at her.
“Ooh, then, can I have some flowers? Please?”
He fluttered his eyes at Erin. She glared.
“Well played.”
