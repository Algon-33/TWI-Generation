“I’m sorry. I know you probably don’t feel bad at all. Not after what happened. With Calruz.”
“Yeah. I don’t. I just wish I could have talked him into releasing the Gnolls. I wish I could have stopped him. But I didn’t. That was my fault.”
The half-Elf shook her head. Erin reached out and grabbed her flesh hand.
“It wasn’t. You did all you could.”
“I didn’t save him. He’s going to be executed. Drake law. I should have killed him when I had the chance. But I couldn’t. He’s…insane, Erin. He wasn’t in his right mind. There were bits and pieces of him, but it was all wrong. That’s the hard part. He cared about Gerial and the others. If he hadn’t, if he’d just been mad, it would have been easy to—but he cared and then—I couldn’t stop it.”
Ceria’s voice cracked. She stared at Moore as the half-Giant began arguing with Jelaqua. Seborn walked over to confer. Erin’s hand squeezed Ceria’s.
“I heard a bit of what happened. I…”
She didn’t finish her sentence. Ceria stared ahead. The sun felt less bright as she whispered.
“It was bad down there, Erin. I told the others about it. But not all of it. I don’t think I can. I wish—I can still hear them screaming. I know there were too many Raskghar. I know. But I was the only adventurer down there. They died and I couldn’t stop them.”
Erin stared at Ceria’s face. The half-Elf shook her head, her hands trembling.
“Do you want to talk about it? I can listen.”
“No. I—maybe later. But not right now. I just want to sit.”
“Okay.”
Ceria stared past Erin. After a while Erin took her hand away. The half-Elf wished she hadn’t. She felt tense. Guilty. Alone, despite Erin sitting next to her. Her failures pierced her over and over until—
Crack.
The half-Elf looked up. Jelaqua had hit the ball. She pointed.
“There! Like that, see?”
Moore stared as Ksmvr and Yvlon looked up. The Antinium and woman watched the ball land and then remembered they had to run and pick it up. He turned and glared at Jelaqua.
“Like what? You’re just hitting the ball, Jelaqua. Let me keep trying.”
“Aw, come on!”
The half-Giant took a position at home base again. Ceria watched Seborn throw a ball and Moore miss. Suddenly, she was back in the present. She looked around. Erin was watching her. Ceria half-rose. Then she inhaled and smelled the earth. The grass. She looked up and saw the sun.
Her heart began to beat slowly again. Ceria looked at her hands, and then at Erin. The young woman smiled. Her eyes were mostly dry, but there was still moisture in them.
“It’s a beautiful day.”
Ceria looked up. The sky was blue. High, high above, a few clouds slowly moved across the vast sky. The half-Elf closed her eyes and inhaled the scent of growing life. The sun shone down as Moore finally hit a ball and Mrsha and Pisces both raced after it. Ceria remembered the dungeon, the scent of blood. Calruz’s eyes full of madness. The Raskghar devouring the heart over the lifeless Gnoll. She blinked and found her eyes were watering as well.
“It really is, isn’t it?”
The two sat together for a while. Just sat. The horrors of the past melted away from Ceria as she watched Seborn take a place at bat. He swung and connected with the first ball, ran around the bases until Ksmvr tagged him out, and then waited at first base as Lyonette took a turn swinging the bat. The game was boring. Some might have even called it dull. But in this moment, it was the game Ceria needed. So she stood up.
“Alright. I’ll give it a shot.”
Erin looked up.
“You sure?”
Ceria smiled.
“Why not? I could use a bit of exercise. And I can always lie down afterwards. Are you going to play too?”
