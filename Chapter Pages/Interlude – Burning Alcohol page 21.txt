Interlude – Burning Alcohol

“Ceria told me she was leaving. I wish her the best. And you. I am sorry.”
He began to walk past Erin, slowly, step by step as the chains dragged. Erin looked at him.
“For what?”
The Minotaur paused. The [Honorbound Prisoner] looked back.
“Everything.”
The word struck Erin. Her history with Calruz unfolded before her. Him and his team, teaching her to punch, Skinner, the Raskghar, Mrsha, the rituals—all of it. In one long moment, she saw Calruz turn away. Erin looked at his back. And she remembered a Minotaur striding into the Crypt of Liscor. Back straight and proud.
“Don’t you dare.”
He turned. Erin stood behind him. She looked at Calruz. Angry.
“Don’t you dare apologize like that and just walk away.”
“I’m sorry.”
The Minotaur bowed his head. Erin was shaking. Not with anger, or sadness, or any one thing. She touched her chest. Then she looked at Calruz. She turned around. Then stared at him.
“You killed good people. You did horrible things. I saw it. Don’t you dare apologize like that.”
“I know. I cannot.”
The Minotaur murmured. Erin went on.
“And don’t you dare apologize for the rest. Not for everything.”
He looked up. Erin stared around the quiet crowd.
“I saw you. I saw you charge into the inn. Alone. With hundreds of Crelers inside. I knew a Minotaur who taught me how to punch. Who led the best team of adventurers I ever met! Don’t’ you dare apologize for him. For the one who taught me—this! [Minotaur Punch]!”
Erin’s fist flashed through the air. It stopped, and she pointed at Calruz’ chest.
“And don’t you dare hide. The Calruz I knew wouldn’t walk like that. He’d take the burdens on his shoulders.”
“I’m trying. But how can I atone for what I’ve done? How, in a thousand years?”
He whispered. He met Erin’s eyes, lost and sad and…searching. Erin Solstice stared at him.
“I don’t know. But I know this. I remember Calruz the Adventurer. Calruz, the mad thing in the dungeon, leader of the Raskghar. Calruz the [Prisoner]. Calruz of Hammerad, this is what I think of you.”
The [Innkeeper] slowly reached for her chest. She looked at Calruz. The one-armed Minotaur, who had lost everything. His honor, his team. His mind. And he was not one thing, like the emotions in her chest.
He was a monster. A brave adventurer. A remorseful prisoner. A distant figure, charging into the inn alone. All these things and more.
Could you forgive someone like that? Could she? Erin Solstice reached into her chest and pulled out the answer. She cupped it in her hands.
Fire, like her memories. 
A small flame blossomed between Erin’s hands. A tiny, but painfully bright light. Calruz tried to shield his eyes. But he couldn’t. He looked, and stared.
“What is that?”
The young woman stared at the fire. It burned. And it had a mild heat. But…terribly warm. The kind that could keep you warm in the face of the coldest winds.
It burned, with an [Innkeeper]’s regrets. Her sorrows. And yes, even some hate. Anger. But it was also made of something else.
Glory. All she remembered of Calruz, all she respected and loved about him. All he was. And the shadow he had become. But the glory, the memory of it did not, could not be consumed by the bad. The fire was mercy and redemption. Forgiveness, all she could give.
But—glory. And that word was not bravery or courage alone. It was good and bad. And it burned, with the brilliant white center that seared the eyes, turning lighter, from white to pink and red.
