Or…injured. Mortally injured? Held in stasis? How did you even say it?
How did you tell someone…? And why had Lyonette never done it? The answer was simple. It had always been Erin.
Or the news had come to the inn. Of all the duties the [Innkeeper] had ever taken on—Lyonette wished she knew how to say it. Because she had realized.
Geneva Scala had not known Erin was dead. Was—that anything had even happened. Pallass had known, and Esthelm, and Liscor and Celum and Invrisil because all those cities had been alerted when they were trying to save her.
But the others didn’t know. They had no idea.
Ilvriss. Krshia? Griffon Hunt. The [Emperor]. The Players of Celum, on their way to Riverfarm already. Klbkch.
The Horns of Hammerad.
Ryoka Griffin.
The duty of notifying them fell to Lyonette. She did not want to. It would make it even realer. It would hurt even more. Her failure.
Stop killing them, Bird.
The [Princess] felt sick. How was—how—
Mrsha was listening to Montressa, Bezale, and Palt speaking with Viceria and Falene.
“You’ve never heard of any spells? Potions?”
“[Restoration]. The Healer of Tenbault—but even Gold-rank adventurers struggle to get healing from her. Beyond that? It’s the upper floors.”
“It always is.”
Mrsha was lying, shivering. But listening with intensity. She’d…thrown up. Eaten two slices of pizza, and then been physically ill. Lyonette had wrapped her in a blanket.
Everything was wrong. Only the words kept Lyonette moving.
Not dead. She was not dead. Lyonette stumbled towards the magic door, for the Mage’s Guild. Then she remembered Bezale was here.
She turned back. One of the Brothers of Serendipitous Meetings sat back down. Lyonette looked at him.
“I’m staying here.”
He nodded. Hatless. She felt as blank as his face. She walked over to Bezale. But what did you write?
Paper. Quill. Ink. Lyonette found herself sitting at the table. She tried to write.
 
Erin Solstice is dead.
 
No, erase that. Scratch it out. It was not true.
But it was true. As good as. How was she supposed to say it?
 
Erin Solstice is dead.
Dear Horns of Hammerad,
I am writing to you to convey ill tidings—
 
What was she writing? At this moment, all the eloquence of Calanfer felt worthless, hollow. Lyonette crossed it all out. Tried again.
 
To the Horns of Hammerad. 
 
No, wait.
 
Ceria. Yvlon. Pisces?
 
Was she going to write to each one? Lyonette tried Ilvriss. It was—easier. He had been here long. But it wasn’t the same as the Horns.
 
To Wall Lord Ilvriss of Salazsar from Lyonette of The Wandering Inn,
I regret to—
 
I regret. Lyonette stared at the words. I. Regret. She wrote again, the words coming from her.
 
Erin is dead. She’s not dead. But she’s dead. They say they might be able to heal her. But no one knows. She’s dead. They shot her. It was my fault. I shouldn’t have stopped Bird. I should have stopped Numbtongue.
This is all my fault.
This is all my fault.
Erin Solstice is dead.
 
She crossed out the words. And tried again.

Olesm listened as Bevussa finally spotted Hectval’s main army.
“Ten thousand marching at us, Olesm!”
“They must have conscripted a large number of civilians. Gnolls?”
“Nearly a third.”
“So they’re not [Soldiers]. Tell the others to fall back! Fall back! This is not a good idea!”
The Drake stared ahead at the rocky landscape. Hectval was marching downhill. Liscor’s army was—he looked around.
“Well?”
Moore didn’t even turn his head. Olesm felt a pit in his stomach.
“They’re going to advance right into the army. Grab Moore!”
“Grab him? You nuts?”
