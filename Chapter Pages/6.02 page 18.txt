Garen. Spiderslicer. Eater of Spears. Reiss. The list rolled endlessly in Numbtongue’s head. A hundred thousand faces flashed before him. And still he did not weep. He looked at Erin, saw her sob once.
Just once. And that was it. Numbtongue looked down at his chest. He touched the red scar of the spear on his heart. Felt the pain. But it was shallow. He dug a nail into it, watched blood start to flow. It wasn’t anything close to real pain.
“Numbtongue!”
Erin saw. She grabbed at his hand. Numbtongue shook her off. He saw her red eyes. But he also saw the truth. She’d stopped crying. Maybe yesterday. Maybe this morning. But whenever it had been, the tears had stopped. They flowed now, but only a few. And in Numbtongue, there was emptiness. Pain, but not enough.
It didn’t hurt enough. Not anymore. Time had already taken the pain away. Numbtongue tried to conjure the desolation, the all-consuming despair and grief he’d felt the first few days. But it was stale. Hollow. He couldn’t cry. And that hurt most of all.
“Don’t. Please. I’m so sorry. If I could do anything—you have to stay here. In your room. If anyone sees you—I won’t let them come near the inn. I promise.”
Erin clung to Numbtongue, hugging him. He looked down at her, feeling her warm embrace. Stay here? He heard her words vaguely, took in the meaning. And he tensed.
Any Goblin could have known what Numbtongue thought in that moment. Any one of them. Headscratcher, Shorthilt, Rabbiteater, Badarrow—or a Cave Goblin, or Reiss. Anyone. But there was no one anymore. No other Goblin to read his unspoken thoughts. No one to know how he felt. So Numbtongue spoke.
“Are you ashamed of us?”
Erin jerked. She froze up and looked at Numbtongue.
“No. Never. Why would you—”
“Because. You. You are here. You want me to stay here.”
Numbtongue reached down. He grabbed Erin’s hands. Squeezed them.
“I should stay here? Hide? We did nothing wrong.”
Nothing. He remembered running with the others. Laughing. Charging together. Erin gulped.
“But if they try to kill you again—”
“Let them. I did nothing wrong. You are crying here. But it doesn’t matter. I—we—deserve better. We did nothing wrong. Why are you hiding?”
He looked at her. Erin struggled for words. Numbtongue turned away abruptly.
“I’m going.”
“Where? Numbtongue!”
She tried to stop him. But in the end, she was weaker than he was. That was one of the reasons why he loved her. Because she was strong while being weak. But she wasn’t strong now. He was disappointed in her. In all of them.
Numbtongue came down the stairs. The adventurers looked at him. One of them—Ceria, stood up.
“Numbtongue. We’re—I’m—so sorry about what happened. What you did was heroic. If there’s anything—”
The same words. Numbtongue gave Ceria a long stare that froze the words on the half-Elf’s tongue.
Sorry. They were sorry. That wasn’t the point! Numbtongue wanted to smash one of the tables. He wanted to rage. But something else burned hotter in him. He looked around. And then he strode for the door.
“Numbtongue!”
The magic door stood in front of Numbtongue. He plucked Celum’s mana stone from it, tossed it to one side. He reached for Liscor’s stone, placed it on the door. Then he reached for the handle.
Hands grabbed him. Numbtongue turned. Jelaqua had hold of him. So did Yvlon. And Erin.
“Don’t! They’ll attack you!”
“So?”
There was nothing they could do to him that was worse. Numbtongue looked at Erin. She didn’t understand. He reached down and tugged her hands off her arm.
“We won. We did nothing wrong. I will not hide.”
