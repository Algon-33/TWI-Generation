Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 43
Everything was slower. He was faster now—he heard the roar of blood in his ears. The cheering [Soldiers], one noise. He surged upright, threw a punch.
It rocked the huge man. Rabbiteater saw it. Yerzhen’s eyes crossed for a second. Rabbiteater threw a second—

—Landed. Landed? His mouth was full of blood. He tried to sit up and realized he was on his front.
“Dead gods, that’s two punches! The [General]’s killed [Knights] with one!”
Someone was shouting. Rabbiteater pushed himself up.
“I want my axe.”
It was like fighting Badarrow with arrows. Fists—bad. He looked around—then saw the Human charging at him. Rabbiteater dodged—went flying again.
Properly flying. He hit the ground. Stared upwards.
Level 40 [General], then. There was no way…he was a Level 29 [Champion]. Level 50?
“…cause you’re just…”
Someone said something? He turned his head. Saw the fist coming down.
The blow to the back of his head hammered him into the mud and dirt. Talia shouted as the armored figure collapsed. She saw Yerzhen raise his arms, roaring to his army of countless thousands.

“It’s because you’re just borrowing it. It can’t compare with the genuine article. Not yet, at any rate.”
Rabbiteater jerked. He opened his eyes. He looked around and nearly fell out of his chair.
He was leaning back in it, rocking on two legs. He sat forwards. The chair landed.
The table held an empty plate. A mug that had dregs of milk. A meal? Rabbiteater looked for the speaker.
Zel Shivertail sat there, taking his ease. He was picking at his teeth delicately.
“Huh?”
“It’s because you’re borrowing my strength. I don’t fight with my fists. Claws. See?”
He showed Rabbiteater his claws. The Hobgoblin turned. Zel looked at him.
“But I’m not here. And you have to roll. Left.”
“Lef—”
 
—-
 
Rabbiteater rolled left. The foot smashed down where his back would have been. Yerzhen cursed. The Goblin surged upright, but the kick sent him stumbling onto his feet. His head—

“…you think is happening?”
The Drake shrugged. He looked around.
“No service. This inn hasn’t changed much. But I rather liked the [Princess]. Did I know she was a [Princess]? I don’t think I’m quite real. Half-real. Made up of what she thought of me. Filled in by the Skill, rather. Isn’t that right?”
He turned in his seat. Erin plonked the steak down and folded her arms.
“Hey! I’m doing my best! I’m not even sure if I’m here.”
Zel nodded. Rabbiteater rubbed at his eyes. He realized he was out of his armor.
“…Why a steak? At least bring me something Imani’s made. If I came back from the dead, could you at least bring me a new dish? Thank you.”
“Gah! You’re like Grimalkin. Sorry.”
Erin threw up her hands. Zel rubbed at his head.
“I remember Grimalkin of Pallass. He challenged me to a fight like this. I refused.”
He looked at Rabbiteater.
“He has two hundred pounds on you. Even with [Boon of the Guest]—he’s got at least ten levels, you know.”
“I know. But I had to fight.”
“Like this?”
The [General]’s voice was commanding without even trying. Rabbiteater ducked his head, flushing, as if a senior Hob were telling him he was an idiot while still being nice. Zel shook his head.
“Sometimes you have to. I understand that. But look at him. Even with my strength and speed and toughness—”

The Bear of Ailendamus kept charging. He was big. His body could absorb punches. He had weight. Rabbiteater had a [Boon]. But he wasn’t—
