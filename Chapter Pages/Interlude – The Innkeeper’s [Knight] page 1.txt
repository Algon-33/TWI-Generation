Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 1
The fist deformed his helmet and dropped the [Spring Knight] like a sack of stones. The other [Knights] turned as a huge man roared into the fight. The same fellow who’d tossed Ser Markus like a sack of wheat.
“Put ‘em down, boys! Come on, you armored ponces!”
He spun on one heel and belted another opponent across the face. He was fighting barehanded, but his fists deformed unenchanted metal. A [Knight] came at him with a sword and he blocked the strike on his forearm and checked the other figure to the ground with one arm.
…As it turned out, the commander of the land forces might have been careless, but only because he didn’t see the armor as adding to the Order of Seasons’ threat. Indeed, it was a giant of a man. Hyperbolically; he wasn’t an actual half-Giant, although he was well over six feet tall.
Also—huge. Heavyset. He had to be three hundred…possibly four hundred pounds? And it was a mistake to say it was all fat. Indeed, as another [Knight] rushed forwards with a roar, the [General] charged into him and sent the figure flying.
“Take down the [General]!”
The female [Summer Knight]’s blade glowed, the plain steel beginning to deform with the heat.
[Aura Blade]. The specialty of the Order of Seasons. The [General] spotted the threat and grinned.
“Aha!”
He strode forwards, as his rough-and-ready soldiers and officers put up more of a fight than the Order of Seasons were expecting. They weren’t perfect, military [Soldiers], but they were experienced, decently leveled—
And of course, they far outnumbered the group that had been captured at sea on their way home. More [Knights] went down, subdued by the sheer numbers.
A few kept fighting. Summer Knights, the experienced Spring Knights—and a figure in plain metal armor, not as decorated as the others. A foreign [Knight] from Izril. He stood with his back to the female Summer Knight.
“Face me, [General] of Ailendamus!”
Talia Kallinad raised her sword and saluted the [General]. He just charged at her. She pivoted—
“[Lance Thrust]!”
All the force of a charging [Knight] on horseback put into a fast blow. The huge [General]—who had hair like armor on his thick arms—stopped his rush.
“[Steelguard Block]!”
He blocked the sword, swearing as the tip struck his arm and singed his hair. Talia recoiled; she’d cut fairly deep, but her sword’s tip hadn’t even hit bone!
Two Skills met, but both had a dozen more. Talia jerked back her blade, noting the blunted tip. The steel was suffering from the burning heat she was infusing into it. But she still increased the temperature, using her [Aura Blade]. The man clearly had skin like iron! She had to burn him. She whirled the sword.
“[Swallow’s A—]”
She stumbled, making an incoherent noise of pain. The other [Knights] turned. Talia began to fold up as the [General] shoulder-charged once more and threw her down. He didn’t give her a chance to fight back—he stomped on her chest and went on, roaring.
“For Ailendamus! Give it to ‘em, boys!”
What had happened? If you had time to process it, one would have realized that the [General] had, in fact, used a Skill without having to shout its name. In fact, he’d used [Flash Punch] before Talia could activate her second Skill, combined with [Extended Reach: Three Feet]. The combination of both Skills—
Well, the point was Talia was down. The other [Knights] faltered. She was their best fighter! Two put up their blades, realizing that even if they made it to the horses, their comrades would be left behind.
“Yield! Yield!”
