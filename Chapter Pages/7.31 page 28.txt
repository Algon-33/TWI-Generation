“Good. Numbtongue, Beza—is Pallass bad too?”
“Yes. But Chaldion’s declared martial law. We opened the door to check.”
Lyonette looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] set her jaw.
“Maybe…okay. Numbtongue, Beza—Palt, Montressa—I’d be grateful if you helped.”
“Absolutely, but Erin, your inn is secure.”
The others looked at the [Innkeeper]. She was going overboard. Erin looked around.
“I know that. But I need those [Knights]. How many. Six? Plus Numbtongue, Beza, me, Palt, Montressa—Maviola?”
“Erin Solstice. What are you doing?”
The [Innkeeper] turned.
“Ishkr’s in that mess. So is Ekirra, Visma—the Workers. What about Selys? She’s at the Adventurer’s Guild.”
The others looked at her. Lyonette opened her mouth furiously.
“Erin!”
“We’ll grab the door and move it. And check. Or should we leave them?”
“You’ll be torn apart! Didn’t that teach you anything?”
The [Innkeeper] gave Lyonette a flat look. The [Princess] wavered. Slowly, Erin walked over to her emergency box. Saliss had given her many potions. And she’d bought more from Octavia. Erin picked up a bag of Tripvines and checked it.
“Absolutely. Palt?”
“Yes, Erin?”
The Centaur looked at Erin. Not with the exasperation written on Maviola’s face, but a calm look. Even expectantly. Erin glanced at him.
“How many people can you cast [Invisibility] on at once?”
Numbtongue glanced at Erin. The Hobgoblin’s eyes lit up. And Palt smiled.
“Let’s find out.”

It was all reaching a critical point. Yellow Splatters stared at the Workers flooding into the Hive. Many were hurt. They’d been attacked by the mobs on the streets. Those that had been closest to the Hive had fled.
Some hadn’t made it. Some were alive. Xrn calmly stared upwards.
“They are hurt. Some will die.”
“Some have died.”
Pawn whispered. He knelt over a Worker, clasped his hands. The Worker’s torn antennae stumps healed. But the missing appendages did not. The Worker stopped shaking—reached up. Pawn clasped his hands with two of his.
“I am so sorry.”
“It is not your fault.”
Xrn’s eyes were black. She looked above. Yellow Splatters clenched and unclenched his hands.
“They have turned on the Antinium.”
“Yes. What did you expect?”
The Antinium didn’t know what to say. The Free Queen however, remembered.
“It has happened again. So once, when we first settled in Liscor. Now again. Abide.”
Her command came through their mental link. The Antinium—shuddered. Yellow Splatters disagreed. He looked at Xrn.
“Prognugator. Those Workers are innocent.”
The Small Queen heard the anger in his voice. She looked around at the silent Painted Antinium, bearing witness. Xrn smiled. Fury and light in her eyes.
“Yes. So what will you do?”

The riot had reached Magnolia’s mansion thirty minutes ago. Now—the mansion was under siege. Lord Alman saw people trying to scale the walls. Break down the flimsy-looking metal bars on the gates.
Unfortunately—of all the riots occurring in the world, this was the least successful. Those two wretched Drakes were reporting on it.
“—hearing reports of riots from Pallass! Ancestors! Should we go back, Sir Relz?”
“I think so, Noass. The protests here have hit a standstill. As you can see—the people cannot even get into the mansion. And from what we understand—Lady Magnolia Reinhart doesn’t even appear to be in residence! Something of an embarrassment, yes?”
Lord Alman glowered at them. Drakes. But they were right. He saw someone trying to climb over the walls of Magnolia’s mansion. The man got to the top of the low-flung wall—and the air shimmered. He was casually knocked off the wall and into the crowd below.
