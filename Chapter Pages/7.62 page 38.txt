The [Magic Crossbowman] took aim down the glass sight. He sighted at her chest. The [Archers] fired. Then he did.
[Piercing Shot].
[Homing Arrows].
Enchanted munitions. Maviola saw the five arrows and bolts and pointed. [Fast Fireball] destroyed two. Her aura reached out, detonated the other three, burning the arrows up. The bolt shot at her, twice as fast as the other two.
Maviola El leaned and the bolt missed her, the passage of the wind ripping at her sleeve. The [Magic Crossbowman] lowered his weapon, cursing.
She dodged! That wasn’t fair! The [Bannerlady] pulled herself back upright. She lifted her banner.
Two arrows struck her in the chest.
Maviola’s eyes went wide. She staggered. The Drake with the shield and the Gnoll guarding her whirled.
The fire of the banner went out. Maviola stared. But her aura—
The two shafts were black wood. The fletching like midnight. They smoked. But they did not burn. She grasped at them weakly. Then—fell from the saddle.
Olesm Swifttail looked back. He saw Maviola El fall. His momentum slowed.
“Maviola?”
She was lying there. The two failed bodyguards knelt around her as Olesm and 4th Company slowed.
“Regroup! Regroup!”
Embria was shouting. Olesm had abandoned his charge. He was trying to—this could not be happening. He turned back.
“Keep going, you fool!”
Maviola El screamed. She was on the ground. Blood welled around the arrows. Her eyes were flickering. She pointed at him.
“Go.”
Did she scream it or whisper. The [Lady] did not know. But she stood.
Clutching at the banner. The piece of charred wood. Flame. Maviola looked up.
But no fire came. She felt her heart stop.
Ah.
A single Potion of Youth slipped from her grip. The Gnoll reached for it. Maviola didn’t reach for the vial. She looked around and sighed.
Then there was fire. It did not come from the banner. It came from her.
The fighting soldiers of Liscor and Hectval both looked up. The [Bannerlady of Memory’s Flame] ignited. Her skin caught the magical fire she had known all her life.
The blaze of her soul.
Numbtongue looked up and saw the fire through stone and bodies. Lyonette cried out.
“Maviola!”
She felt it, even from the inn. The [Lady] said nothing. She stood there. And the fire touched the souls of all who saw it.
Hectval, Liscor—sparing only the two bodyguards who watched her sides. It burned in them.
Fight. Fight! Maviola looked at Olesm. He stared at her.
His eyes filled with tears. Tears—he should have wept for Erin. For Maviola. Tears. Rage. Despair. Grief.
All of it at once. Yet he had heard her words. He lifted the glowing artifact in his claws. He looked ahead.
The [General] was celebrating. But he caught sight of Olesm, pointed at him. The [Strategist] whispered.
“I have lost everything.”
He rode forwards as 4th Company charged. For the [Innkeeper]. For Liscor. For the House of El and Maviola.

Of course he would make it. Maviola’s vision was blurring. She raised the staff. The fire—oh—
“We will bring you, Lady El.”
The Gnoll spoke. She turned, staring at him dumbly. Maviola’s burning gaze flickered, seeing the burning souls of all around them.
“My heart—”
Fire engulfed the place where she stood.

The blast of fire blew apart both armies. The [General] stared at the place where the [Lady] had been. He killed her. He had done it.
Just—why hadn’t he won?
He stared up. The [Riders] were hacking towards him. The two in front—one with a spear that cut down his personal guard. The other’s glowing blade was just as deadly.
“You…this is no proper war. Humans? Antinium? Don’t you have any shame?”
