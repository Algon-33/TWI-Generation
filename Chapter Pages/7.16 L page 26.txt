“You are wrong, Klbkch. We are that we are. I will not obey wrong orders. I am of the Free Hive. But it is not you alone. The Free Queen disagrees with you.”
“You will never return to the Hive.”
The Antinium with the silver blades looked at Pawn. The Worker stared at him.
“…I do not fear you, Klbkch. Not anymore. You are not all-knowing. You do not know what we need.”
“I do not need your fear. I require your obedience. If you do not obey, you are worthless. No levels or classes will change that.”
“Klbk…”
Erin tried to intrude. But the two Antinium were speaking for only each other. For the Antinium. Two kinds stood there. And one, the old, spoke.
“Do not return to the Hive. Any of you. I will cut you down if I see you. You are not of the Antinium. You are not True Antinium, or even false copies. You are worthless.”
Anand shook and fell down. The other Antinium were frozen. Pawn looked at Klbkch.
“You cannot deny what we are.”
He tried to walk through the door. The other Antinium dragged him back. Pawn struggled—and only then did Erin move. She shut the door. Klbkch looked at her. She looked back.
The old Antinium sheathed his sword. Erin paused. She looked at Klbkch. At the silent room. And she wished she had talked to him a day earlier. An hour.
Too late. Too late, too late. Erin looked at her old friend as some of him returned.
“Hi, Klbkch. Let’s talk.”
 
—-
 
They sat alone. Alone, in an empty inn.
No one else—well—other people. Talking quietly, as the blood and severed arm were cleaned up. Many left. The Antinium were secure in the Garden of Sanctuary. Erin refused to let them out until Klbkch was gone.
But Erin—sat in her room. With Klbkch.
There was no preamble. No asking ‘why’, or anything else. Just—talking. The talk they should have had. That Erin had neglected.
And the consequences were this. The Antinium faced Erin. With a different body. Erin missed the old one, the Worker. For all he was smaller, weaker. Because she had loved that Antinium. This new one was…harsher. Different. She wanted to go back to the Klbkch of then—or perhaps—simply the Klbkch she had not known.
He spoke abruptly, looking at her. Splattered green blood had dried on his shoulder and head.
“I was grateful to you, Erin. I am still. I rejoiced to see Individuals. I believed they were what I had sought. Thinking, growing Antinium. True Antinium.”
“But?”
“But they are not. They are insubordinate. Different.”
“Different is okay.”
The young woman saw the Antinium look at her. And her stomach twisted.
“No. The Antinium are not what they should be. I labored for over a decade to bring them consciousness. And—yes. This Individuality is what I sought. The capacity to level. Think. Decide. I could have tolerated them to my satisfaction—beyond my expected satisfaction—even if they were not True Antinium. But they do not obey.”
“Look, they’re growing. It was a mistake. They love you. Anand—”
“They are worthless.”
The young woman felt cold.
“Don’t say that. They’re growing. They make mistakes. They’re kids. So what if they don’t obey. They all respect you. Even Pawn. He just wants you to listen—”
A high-pitched sound interrupted Erin. A chittering, scratching sound, high and sharp. Like a grasshopper. Unnatural. She shuddered and saw Klbkch’s mandibles moving. Only then did she realize.
He was laughing. Like an insect laughed. He looked at her, and his eyes were blank. Insectile. She had grown used to them, but now they looked completely alien.
