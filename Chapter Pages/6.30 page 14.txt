“That guy. I’m gonna give him what for when I get to his table. But for now—sorry. I forgot to do this! Here, Yellow Splatters, lean in?”
“Lean wh—”
The [Sergeant] looked up. He moved back and Erin surprised him and Pawn both by grabbing their shoulders. She hugged them both, a long, tight hug that warmed both Antinium from within. They stared at each other, and then at her. Pawn hesitantly reached a hand up. Yellow Splatters was still.
“I’m glad you’re back.”
That was all Erin said to Yellow Splatters. But her watery eyes said it all. She wiped at them.
“Thank you. I never got to say it, but thank you. When the Goblin Lord and—I saw your guys. And Pawn told me what you did. I’m so sorry—but thank you. I know it seems like they died for nothing. But you saved me. And I wish—”
She sniffed hard and wiped her eyes again. Pawn looked at Erin, aghast at her tears. He stood up.
“It was not in vain. They are in—”
A hand grabbed one of his. Yellow Splatters looked at Pawn and the Worker froze. Erin didn’t notice. She wiped her eyes again and smiled brightly.
“It wasn’t in vain. I know that. Definitely. And I want to do something—oh! Hold on. Let me get something for you.”
She hurried back into the kitchen, calling for Lyonette again. Pawn looked at Yellow Splatters. He sat.
“Why did you stop me?”
“It is not for her.”
“What? Heaven? I know that. But she can know they are there.”
Yellow Splatters shook his head after a moment’s pause.
“But it is not hers.”
The Worker looked at him. Pawn opened his mandibles, but he couldn’t conceive of arguing. Instead, he sat closer to the table. And some of the questions bubbling away at him poured out.
“What is it like? Are there gods there? Is it in the clouds? How many—how many of us are there? Is it really…heaven?”
His heart beat anxiously in his chest. And he believed, he tried to believe, he truly did. But the proof sat in front of him. And when Yellow Splatters met his eyes, Pawn felt hope and something as pure as faith blossom in his chest.
“Yes. It is there.”
Pawn exhaled. Slowly. The feeling he had was—
“How? Was it always there? What does it—”
Yellow Splatters was shaking his head.
“Only those who believed could find it. And it was…”
The [Sergeant] broke off. He reached up, his mandibles opening and closing, towards the ceiling.
“It looked like…felt…like…as…”
The words trailed off. At last, the Soldier sat back and shook his head. He met Pawn’s gaze.
“If there were words that could describe it, it could be built here. But there are not. It was…satisfying.”
“Satisfying?”
The Worker’s antennae waved in puzzlement. Yellow Splatters nodded slowly, mulling it over.
“More than that word. Yes. Satisfying. Peaceful. Warm. But fragile. It must be guarded and grown. By the Painted Antinium. They must know it exists, and fight for it. Fight to live so that death has worth.”
Each sentence struck Pawn like a blow. He wanted to fall to his knees. Instead, he gripped the table, overcome by wordless emotion. At last, he looked up. And his voice trembled.
“I am so sorry. I asked so much. I did not know the cost. If I could have, I would have died. But they all—all of them—”
It was what he’d wanted to say. Had to say. The words poured out.
“—should have stopped you. Or listened. Or done something better. The spells—I didn’t know. I had to do it for Erin. But I—I—”
