Embria sat atop her horse at the bottom of the gates. She saluted Zevara with her spear. The Watch Captain looked up at her.
“Embria. The Goblins.”
“I can see.”
The Wing Commander stared at the desperate Goblins. She shook her head.
“Block the gates. I’ll stop them from entering the city. Don’t go after us. Hold the Humans out.”
“What? Are you mad?”
Embria didn’t answer her. The Wing Commander turned. Her small company of [Soldiers] stood at the gates. Behind them were a thousand of Pallass’ [Soldiers]. They looked up as Embria rode past them.
“Drakes! Prepare to sortie! We need to hold the Goblins back from the city. Don’t falter! Soldiers of Pallass, on me! 4th Company of Liscor, on my tail! [Captains], give your orders!”
She rode forwards. Zevara stared at her back.
“You’ll die!”
The Drake turned. Her face was pale.
“I have orders. Keep Liscor safe.”
A voice shouted from above. Zevara looked up. Relc. He shouted down at his daughter.
“Embria!”
The young Drake raised her spear. She fastened the helmet to her head and pointed her spear ahead. The [Soldiers] tensed. The [Captains] roared as they advanced. Embria moved forwards at a trot.
“[Daring Charge]! [Piercing Arms]!”
“[Shieldwall Formation!]”
“[First Strikes]! [Formation: Accelerate]!”
“[Bravehearts]! [Reckless Charge]! [Minute of Iron]!”
The Skills overlapped with each other. The Drakes forgot their fear. They streamed out the gates, following Embria. The Wing Commander was breathing heavily. The Goblins were streaming towards her. She quickened her pace. The horse began to run. Then gallop.
“[Blades of Glory]. For Liscor! Charge!”
The Drakes and Gnolls followed her with a roar. Zevara saw the Workers drag a boulder in front of the gate. She heard a cry from above. Relc stared as his daughter rode straight at the Goblins.
They saw her coming. And they wavered. But fear drove them on. The Goblins ran for Liscor as Embria’s thousand Drakes surged towards them.
“I told you I could rout two thousand Goblins with a thousand [Soldiers]. How about this?”
Embria muttered to herself. She saw the first volley of arrows fly from the walls. Light flashed from the walls. Someone was activating the enchantments, one after another. Magic blasted the Goblins apart. Embria raced forwards. Her spear swung down and she stabbed the first Goblin. The line of Drakes crashed into the fleeing Goblins. And the Goblins began to die.

“What is that Drake [Commander] doing? She’s left the city!”
Umina cried out in horror. Niers stared down at the projection.
“She’s trying to push them back.”
Marian was white with horror. The Centaur’s eyes were fixed on the red Drake leading the thousand-odd [Soldiers] forwards. She turned to Niers.
“It’s suicide! She’ll be overrun! And if not by the Goblins, she’s exposed to the Humans—”
“That’s their way. If she can hold the Goblins back, Liscor can repair the walls. ”
Venaz stared down at the image in the scrying orb. Every Drake and Gnoll on the wall was firing arrows at the oncoming Goblins. Half of the adventurers were not. The [Strategist], Olesm Swifttail, had made his choice. His claws shook as he unrolled the trigger scrolls. He blasted the Goblins apart, aiming for the black-clad Goblins. But Goblins died either way.
Below, Embria held the line. The Goblins surged towards her, but the ranks of fresh Drakes and the Skills of her company cut them down. Drakes with glowing blades sliced down rank after rank of wounded Goblins. And the Wing Commander spun, her spear slashing in every direction.
