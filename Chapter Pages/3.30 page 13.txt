The world had stopped making sense. Erin stared at the old man while she waited for someone to wake her up from the dream she was having. He nodded to her, impatient.
“A copy. See—this.”
The old man pointed to the small, glowing screen. Erin peered down at the app his finger was pointing at.
“Oh. Safari. That’s an…that’s the internet app.”
“Is it?”
The old man frowned at Erin. He tapped the app and a screen popped up, glowing, white, before the typical ‘no internet’ page flashed on screen.
“You see? I am missing something for it to work. What connection do I need to obtain?”
“Um.”
Erin stared blankly at the screen, and then at the frowning face in front of her. She felt like her brain was trying to work a million miles a second while crawling along at a snail’s pace. She answered automatically as best she could.
“Well, you need internet. But uh, you don’t have internet here. No one in this…this world does. So…it’s not gonna work.”
“I see. That is inconvenient. Well then, am I to assume these other functions do not work for the same reason?”
The old man clicked a button and the iPhone went back to the menu screen. Erin peered at the iPhone, nodding her head.
“Youtube? Oh—that’s for watching videos. Yeah, it needs internet too.”
“But there are videos on this device.”
“Oh—those are downloaded. Uh, they’re part of it. Youtube needs…the internet.”
“Ah. And the store? This one?”
“Spotify? Yeah. Same problem.”
“I see. How tedious. Is there any other function I may have missed?”
“What?”
“I have listened to every song and watched every ‘video’ on this device. I have solved the riddle of this particular function—”
“You mean the app? 2048? The game?”
“Ah, that’s what they’re called? App. Hm. And yes, it was a quite entertaining game, or rather, logic puzzle. But is there anything else I can do with this device?”
“Well, you could—hold on.”
Erin raised her hand and stared at it. Then she slapped herself as hard as she could. Her head rang a bit.
“Ow!”
“That looked painful.”
“It was. Sorry. Well…you can take notes with the iPhone. See here?”
“Ah yes. And record what is spoken. A useful function, no doubt.”
“And—oh, Ryoka had Triple Town. See—”
Erin found the iPhone nearly snatched out of her hands. The old man stared down at the screen, eyes bulging.
“How did you do that? I couldn’t fathom how I did it once. But you’ve changed the screen!”
“Hm? You didn’t know? You can change the screen since there are more apps. See? You swipe left. Like this…”
“Swipe left. Fascinating.”
Erin stared at the old man as he clumsily moved his fingers across the screen. She felt compelled to reach for the one straw of rationality she had in this moment.
“I’m surprised…Ryoka didn’t tell you how the iPhone worked. Because this is totally something she gave you, right?”
“Hm? Candy Crush? Intriguing. Oh yes, I received this from her.”
“Ah.”
The young woman nodded a few times. The old man was mumbling to himself, mostly along the lines of ‘fascinating’, or ‘yes, this certainly deserves closer study’. Erin stared at him.
“What’s your name?”
“Teriarch. Mm. I can see there is much I have yet to explore. Tell me, I encountered a terrible problem when I went here. To settings, see? And I pressed—”
“Ooh, yeah. Reset. Don’t do that. It gets rid of everything.”
“So I had noticed. But why does it exist?”
“Um. So you can put other things on the device? If you had the internet I mean.”
“Really? How?”
Erin stared at Teriarch. She stared into his multicolored eyes and wondered if today was a good day or not.
“Uh, well, you can’t here. It’s impossible.”
