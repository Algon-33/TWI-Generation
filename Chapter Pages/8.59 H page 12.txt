Shurein nodded.
“An apt parallel. However, they focus only on combat. Some aspects they practice are a lifestyle. Our goal is entirely how we live and conduct ourselves.”
“Aah. And how strong are you?”
The [Abbot]’s smile grew a hair wider.
“If the Antinium had come to Chandrar, you would not underestimate the [Monks] of Sottheim. We were the King of Destruction’s vassals. You have met the Loquea Dree?”
The Antinium nodded. Shureim gestured at the [Monks].
“Loquea Dree as a tribe was small, and their numbers did not change markedly through the war. They grew, but few died since theirs was a small force that kept order. Sottheim’s [Monks] were fewer in number, but our ranks grew exponentially through the war. Yet by the end of the King of Destruction’s conquests, they dropped precipitously. Over ten thousand of our number perished on Baleros with the [Gambler of Fates]. We exacted a fitting toll; many others perished at sea against the House of Minos in their ambush. Since then, our numbers have swelled again. They will rise higher, now we leave and march to war once more.”
Six thousand [Monks], and the same number presumably left to guard the monastery. Ksmvr nodded.
“Six thousand is a small number compared to some armies on Chandrar. They number in the hundreds of thousands, so I can only guess that a [Monk] is superior to a regular [Soldier]. How would you rate their combat status?”
“It depends on their level.”
Ksmvr paused.
“Well, yes. But…on average, how good is a [Monk]?”
Shurein shrugged.
“Superior to a [Soldier] of the same level.”
Ksmvr scratched at the stubs of his antennae.
“…Broadly speaking?”
“Almost always.”
It didn’t sound like arrogance, but that was an incredible claim! Ksmvr eyed one of the female [Monks] walking along with a literal staff for a weapon.
“I believe we are being imprecise. I am not sure if I am ‘being laughed upon’. How strong is she, then?”
Shurein and the female [Monk] glanced up. The [Abbot] gave Ksmvr another polite, slight smile.
“Nothing is certain until the clash. You may be beyond us all, Ksmvr. I would not know from just looking. So…would you like to find out?”

Nsiia strode through the line of [Soldiers] watching, and pushed past people until she ran into that which could not be pushed.
Domehead. But the Golem politely stepped aside for her, and she saw Ksmvr fighting.
Not the female [Monk], but against [Abbot] Shurein himself. The [Monk]—and five others—were sitting, with bruises or, in one case, a split lip which they refused to treat with a potion, watching as the [Abbot] spun his halberd. He stepped left, then right, feinting with the halberd, a jab, a shallow cut—whirling the blade to threaten the right side, as Ksmvr’s swords shone.
[Silver Illusion]. A school of blade arts known for its incredible speed and deceptive cuts. The Antinium [Skirmisher] had inherited it. He still carried the twin shortswords Vasraf had given him.
On loan, much as the shining sword Nsiia carried was. The blades flashed together in a mesmerizing, glittering pattern that would distract you. Even if you sliced at Ksmvr, he might vanish.
The heights of his sword school were a mystery to even Nsiia and Vasraf. Yet it said much that someone had once walked down that long path.
Klbkch the Slayer. It sent a chill down her spine to think of it. Yet…Ksmvr’s delicate sword dance faltered. The Antinium stared at the [Abbot] as Shurein feinted, stepping left and right.
“I believe I am in trouble.”
