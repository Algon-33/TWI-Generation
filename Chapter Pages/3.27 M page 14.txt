But Toren was right behind her. The skeleton had a bared sword in his hands. He advanced towards her, swinging the sword menacingly. Mrsha backed up, the chasm behind her. She tried to watch Toren and the opening, but he was moving too quick. Mrsha backed up another step and her back paw slipped.
She slid backwards. Mrsha grabbed desperately, and her paws latched onto something beneath the powdered snow. Toren halted, sword in hand, staring at Mrsha as she dangled over the abyss.
Mrsha’s eyes were wide, her arms straining as she tried to hold on. She could barely keep her grip, let alone haul herself up. And the skeleton was just standing there. Just watching her.
He had lowered the sword in his hands. He walked forwards, until he stood right above Mrsha. She waited for him to stab her, but the skeleton just stared down at her.
As if thinking.
And Mrsha wished Ryoka were here. But she knew the girl had left. Gone, far away.
Just like everyone else.
She wanted to go home. But home was gone. And she was alone.
Maybe it was fate. Mrsha felt her claws loosening their grip as the snow fell around her. The skeleton was just staring at her, sword in hand. He took a step forwards.
Chased by bad things. Falling. It was how it had happened last time. But there was no Ryoka anymore. She’d left Mrsha too. And that was a good thing. Because she could not suffer because of Mrsha.
All her fault. White fur. Cursed one. Doombringer. [Last Survivor]. Mrsha sighed. She looked up at the sky.
And then she let go. For a moment she saw the skeleton staring at her, the flames in its purple eyes flickering. It reached out—
But too slowly. The world dropped away from Mrsha and she was tumbling, down, down, into the darkness. The air whistled around her and she closed her eyes.
Mrsha fell.

“Mrsha?”
Lyon searched the inn, but she couldn’t find the Gnoll. She tried the outhouse, but Mrsha’s tracks led away from there. She ran through the snow. She went to the gates—tried to get in. But Mrsha had left the city. She’d disappeared.
The girl searched. Mrsha was gone. But Lyonette kept searching. She went out into the wilderness and called for the Gnoll until she’d lost her voice. As the cold numbed her, Lyonette kept looking.
“Mrsha? Mrsha! Are you there?”
“Where are you?”

It was dark when Mrsha woke up. Dark. Hot. Everything hurt.
She cried out. It was the first sound she’d made in a long time. She couldn’t move. She hurt.
And someone was calling for her. Mrsha heard the voice, carried by the wind. A familiar voice.
She wanted to call to it. But something stopped her.
Fear. If she called out the voice would die.
She couldn’t do that. Better to die here.
But it hurt. Mrsha cried. She tried to move. Something was around her. Bad things lurked in the darkness. They were coming.
She had to run. But the voice. Only the voice could save her.
Mrsha looked up. The light was so far away. It seemed like a memory. But she believed the light, the sky was still there.
She wanted to be saved. Mrsha wept. Even if it meant—she just wanted to live.
So she raised her head. Mrsha took a breath and howled. The sound was wordless. It echoed in the dark place she’d fallen into, the dungeon. It went through the skeleton who stood in the darkness, watching her. It travelled up through the rift in the earth and went into the sky.
And Lyonette heard her. Mrsha knew that. She howled and howled, calling out. For salvation. For forgiveness. For another chance.
For life instead of death.
