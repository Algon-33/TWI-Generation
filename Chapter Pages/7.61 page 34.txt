“I don’t—I don’t have what Joseph wants! I can’t just make an antidote on the fly. Here are my best potions—”
She dropped them onto the grass. Bent to pick them up. Numbtongue whirled. He grabbed at them.
“Where is the [Healer]?”
Lyonette had returned. She looked around.
“They’re coming! They’re coming! But—”
It was too slow. The [Princess] stared at Erin. The red bandages. Then she grabbed Bird. Why—why hadn’t she thought of this?
“Get Pawn. Tell the Queen! Tell Xrn! Get them up here—now!”
“Pawn?”
“He can heal her! Get Pawn!”
“Pawn. Pawn. Emergency. EMERGENCY.”
Bird turned. He began screaming the word. Suddenly—Silveran had returned. He screamed the same word.
“EMERGENCY. EMERGENCY.”
The other Workers picked up the shout. They screamed it. Lyonette turned towards the city. Hurry.
“Pawn! Come quickly! Erin is dying!”
She screamed. Her [Boon] flickered. She was trying to put it on Erin. But—
Numbtongue shouted, turning his head.
“Reiss! Reiss!”
Snapjaw stared at him. The [Bard] looked around. Take my hand. He saw the Goblin Lord. Reiss was kneeling next to them. His head in his claws. He looked up at Numbtongue and shook his head. The [Bard] reached out.
Please?
But the Goblin Lord had no answer. Not for this. His power had never been to save.
Lyonette’s words echoed. Becoming truth as it was said at last.
She was dying.
Erin lay there. Blinking slowly. The world was growing…she tried to listen. Someone—many people were pleading with her. Arguing. She tried to tell one.
Not your fault. I didn’t even see it coming. Don’t feel bad. She remembered—she had never known.
“Headscratcher? What did you say to me?”
Above her, Numbtongue had torn the bottles from Octavia’s grasp. He dumped potion after potion onto her wound. Lyonette was screaming at him to stop. That he’d hurt her. But—
Two minutes.
Suddenly, Kevin, the others, were silent. Just holding her tight. Erin didn’t feel—anything—below her. She rasped.
“I’m dying.”
“No you’re not. Erin, accept my [Boon]. Use your Skill on yourself! You have to fight. Use—use your [Immortal Moment]! Don’t give up!”
Lyonette was speaking to her. Holding her hand. Erin saw Mrsha. Other faces. She tried to shake her head, but that was beyond her. There was something she had to say.
“Tell…tell them…”
“Ryoka? No. Tell her yourself.”
The [Princess] whispered. Erin’s eyes flickered.
“My family. Tell them.”
Lyonette du Marquin’s face turned colorless. She froze, as Erin exhaled.
Three. Minutes.
Numbtongue heard shouting from the hallway. He looked up.
“The [Healer] is coming! Just hold on! Hold on!”
Erin’s skin was so pale. Her lips were blue. She was—Numbtongue stared at the liquid. Willing it to stop. Go back inside. He choked.
“It won’t close. Please. Not you. Not you too.”
In the distance, the city exploded with noise. The Black Tide erupted from the tunnels. Light flashed. A spell in progress.
Too slow. Every horn was blaring from the walls.
Too late.
“The world is ending.”
Bird had dropped his bow. He stood there. Looking down at her. Erin inhaled.
She was trying to say something. But the words ended in her throat. She just looked at Bird. At Mrsha, clinging with bloody paws to Lyonette. Up, at Numbtongue. At something else. She tried—
Erin was breathing so slowly, now. And the blood’s flow was stopping. They needed more time. Kevin was shouting at Palt. The Centaur was howling, trying to shout at the same time as Montressa.
The sphere of reality shrunk. It was just Erin. She looked up.
“I was so happy.”
“No.”
