“The thing is, Numbtongue. It’s a bad thing. Riots hurt everyone. Even if you just burn down houses. Let alone kill people.”
“True.”
The [Bard] stood up, told something by Pyrite’s intuition. His own mind. Reiss’ whispers. He saw Erin smile.
“Numbtongue.”
The Hobgoblin reached for her arm, then tightened his grip. He was her protector. And that meant doing things to protect Erin. Even if she didn’t like it. She looked down at his steely grip.
“Hm. Everyone’s through. I’ll let the [Knights] go through. You should go back to the inn.”
The Hobgoblin blocked the door casually with his body. Erin looked at him.
“Numbtongue…”
Her eyes flickered. Then she backed up. The Goblin tensed—but Erin just smiled, raised her arms.
“Good point. You can’t be stupid, right?”
“Right. Stupid gets you killed.”
“Right. Totally understood. I learned my lesson.”
The [Innkeeper] backed up. Numbtongue didn’t move from his spot. He saw Erin smile.
“I really did, Numbtongue.”
She walked back into the common room. The Hobgoblin sighed. He sat down. This time he kept his eyes on the two secret side doors. He closed the door, set it to Liscor and put his back against it.
Even the garden wouldn’t get past him. The Hobgoblin began to play. He listened to a song from another world and closed his eyes. He kept playing for a minute, then two.
When he heard the soft footfall, he didn’t open his eyes or stop playing.
“Go away.”
She didn’t leave. The young woman stood there. She had brought something with her. Well, more than one thing. But one thing mattered.
“Numbtongue…”
“No. I’ll get Lyonette.”
“Numbtongue. I learned a lot. And—I never forget. You know that.”
He opened his eyes. And saw what Erin was carrying. The Hobgoblin’s fingers slipped on his guitar. He tried to stop her. But really—he had never been able to.
On Erin Solstice’s finger, her ring began to shine gold.

The pursuit ended when the horses threw their riders. They had carried Lord Alman faithfully along with his two bodyguards. But the noise, the screaming, the rocks—drove the horses insane. They did what people would have done long ago and reared.
Lord Alman hit the ground. He struggled to his feet as another of his [Bodyguards] was dismounted. The other—an [Archer], kept control of his mount.
“Lord Alman! The crowds!”
The [Lord] ran on foot, then. And the crowds followed, screaming in fury. Magnolia had turned them on him.
On them all. And even she underestimated the danger. Lord Alman ran past the Mage’s Guild, clutching a stitch in his side. He hoped that would slow them—
The crowd brought down the Steel Golem. It knocked them back, but the magical instructions kept it from splattering them. They swarmed it, tossed grappling hooks and dragged it to the street. Then they smashed it with sledgehammers, hacked at it until the magic failed.
That only made the [Lord] run faster. He saw Lord Ranga, his face torn by an arrow, shouting.
“Alman! Alman! Over here!”
The man rode at him, sword drawn. Bloody; but he’d been fleeing. The young [Lord], Mel, was still half out of it. Alman and his two bodyguards ran after Ranga.
They found more [Lords], those who hadn’t managed to escape the city. Lord Toldos was on foot as well. The old man had lost half his bodyguard.
“Where are they?”
“Dead. They ran right over us.”
The old [Lord]’s face was white. He limped after other [Lords] as they tried to find a way out.
“We could fight through…”
Another [Lord] opined. Toldos looked at him.
“And kill hundreds of civilians?”
“Besides which. They’d kill us first. Even with our artifacts.”
