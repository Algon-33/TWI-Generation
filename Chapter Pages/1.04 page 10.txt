Erin fell over and landed next to the writhing fish. She pulled herself away as the gaping maw opened and closed a few feet from her face and waited until the fish slowly stopped moving again. This time she was pretty sure it was dead.

“Aaaaaah!”
Erin hopped around in agony, clutching her foot.
“Is that thing made of rocks?”
It was like kicking a sack of flour. Not that Erin had ever kicked a sack of flour, but she imagined that was what it was like. The fish had barely moved when she kicked it. It lay on the ground, jaw gaping open. It was definitely dead, now.

“Ew. Mutant fish with teeth.”
Erin stared at it for a little while longer. Her stomach rumbled.
