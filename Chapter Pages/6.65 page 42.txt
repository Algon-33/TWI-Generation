It was silent. Dark, windows busted. But deceptively so. After the initial rush, no more shapes emerged from the inn. Yet Erin knew, knew, they were inside.
They were waiting. They could think. Zevara turned.
“Ordinarily, I’d blow the damn inn to bits. But your reinforced walls would make that difficult. Worse, there’s that door inside. We can’t destroy it.”
“I—”
“I’m not doing it for you. It’s a valuable artifact.”
“Watch Captain, there’s also the matter of the adventurers in the Bloodfields. They’re still holding out. They could be alive.”
Zevara looked up at Olesm. The Drake [Strategist] was speaking in an icy calm. Like Erin’s. She hesitated.
“They could be. But we’re not going in there unprepared. Beilmark!”
“Yes, Watch Captain?”
The Senior Guardswoman appeared. Jeiss was at her side. Everyone who could fight had been rallied. Zevara pointed.
“What’s Klbkch’s status? I want Antinium here now!” 
The Gnoll nodded.
“The Antinium are moving on the inn, Watch Captain! They plan to strike from below.”
“Below?”
Olesm exclaimed. Zevara hesitated. But all she did was nod.
“Good! Then we’ll combine our assault when he signals readiness.”
Embria frowned.
“Watch Captain! We can’t take that inn! It’s suicide! Even if I put my best people through that door, the Crelers are waiting! We need Gold-ranks. The Heartflame—”
“Something’s wrong in the dungeon. We got a distress call. The Gold-ranks came under siege by the undead. They’re holding, but they’ve taken casualties.”
Zevara’s voice was terse. Erin looked at her.
“We can’t wait for them. The Horns—”
“I know. Wait!”
Zevara paused. She stared up at the inn. Then she came to a swift decision.
“Prepare to assault from all sides. Olesm, I want [Mages] to tear holes in there. We’re going to hammer the Crelers. Tell Klbkch to wait for my signal. And Beilmark? Get me the Minotaur prisoner. Now.”
“The—”
Beilmark saw Zevara’s head snap up. She saluted.
“At once, Watch Captain”
Erin saw her run. But too slowly. Everything was too—slow—
Twenty nine minutes.

The Hive was in uproar. Klbkch strode down the tunnels as Workers and Soldiers checked the tunnels. Creler attack. They’d gotten Bird’s message. The Antinium Worker had run to deliver it himself, along with the Watch.
“Prepare three thousand Soldiers and two hundred Painted Soldiers for combat. If Crelers infiltrate the Hive, protect the Queen at all costs.”
Klbkch’s swords were drawn. Anand, Pawn, Belgrade, Yellow Splatters, Purple Smiles—all of them were following him. He snapped at Belgrade.
“You will hold the Hive. The Crelers are reported at the Bloodfields and overrunning the inn. If they attack—”
“Is Erin safe?”
“If they attack the Hive, you will hold—”
“Is Erin safe?”
Pawn shouted at Klbkch. The Revalantor nodded.
“She’s alive.”
The Antinium relaxed, but only slightly. Belgrade nodded to Klbkch. Anand looked at the Revalantor.
“What is the role of the strike-force, Revalantor?”
“Assault the inn. Use the Inn-route. Is the tunnel clear?”
“Clear, Revalantor. We will emerge in the basement. How many to lead the strike?”
“I will take Painted Soldiers in.”
Yellow Splatters rumbled. Klbkch paused.
“Send in a wave of Soldiers first. One hundred.”
The [Sergeant] hesitated. But he nodded slowly.
“Very well. The survivors will become Painted Soldiers. And I will follow the hundredth.”
“I will come with—”
“No.”
The word came from all three. Klbkch pointed at Anand.
“Strategist! Lead the assault, but do not enter the inn! Yellow Splatters, choose your strike force and advance! Wait for the Watch to commence their strike and breach the basement!”
