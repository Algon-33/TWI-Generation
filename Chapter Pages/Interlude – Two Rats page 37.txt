Interlude – Two Rats
Page 37
Nothing, for once. The Minotaur spoke a bit more with the half-Elf, casually. Awaiting his fate if it came to pass. Then he looked down. And the rats stared up at him and he stared back. They flinched at he reached down. But the hand that had caused so much grief, the hand which had lost and then grabbed for honor, the hand scarred and worn and gentle, reached down.
And the rats nibbled at it, then climbed up it as it didn’t move. Calruz lifted them up. One white, one grey. And the lonely Minotaur breathed out. He stared at his companions and nodded. With a slow, careful touch, he stroked each’s head with a finger and pointed at the white one first.
“You shall be Haldagaz, Vanquisher of Foes. And you will be Rhata, Trident-Guardian of the Harbor of Hammerad.”
And that was all. The Minotaur lay back. And he smiled.

Erin Solstice lay back too. As she waited for the results of her election, she lay on the floor of Bird’s tower. It was empty. And in the distance, Liscor voted. And below, a little Gnoll followed her mother around. And that was a good thing.
But the rest wasn’t. Erin thought of rats.
“That was Mrsha growing up.”
She thought of Calruz.
“If Lism wins, what do I do?”
And then she thought of Mrsha, running to Zevara. Instead of running to her. And risking her neck. No—learning a spell from Moore. Erin frowned up at the sky.
“How many times is it so far? She just…gets into trouble. What can we do? Get Numbtongue to guard her every hour of the day? Lock her in the inn?”
The sky didn’t answer. A Razorbeak flew overhead, cementing Erin’s point. She stared at the giant bird. And she thought of Goblins.
“Someday it’ll happen again. There’ll be Rags. Or another Headscratcher. Or…they’ll die. The Raskghar might return.”
The sky made no response. Erin rolled over. She poked her inn.
“You know, I’m close. I can feel it. I’ve had a full inn every day. And this is my inn. So…this is my problem. I want a better door, alright? So it can teleport whenever! But Mrsha—keeping her safe’s more important. Her and everyone else.”
There was no response. Erin frowned. She tried again, speaking, really speaking. To the inn? Herself?
“Hey. Inn. On my next level up, I want you to do something to protect them, alright? Mrsha. Goblins. Me too, I guess. Give me the power to save them from anything bad. Can you do that?”
No response. Erin drowsily stared up at the sky.
“Yeah. Next time…”
She yawned. Closed her eyes as Liscor decided its fate. And Erin’s head lolled back. And she closed her eyes—
 
[Magical Innkeeper Level 39!]
 
She waited.
“…And? And? And?”
Erin sat up. She yawned, glared around blearily, and then smacked the floorboards.
“Level 40, then. But it had better be good. Time to grind some exp!”
She made to get up and lay back on the floor. And Erin stared up at the blue sky. And in a place with no sky and little light, a pair of rats crawled around their new home. And they were as happy as could be.
