Rags shook her head. Garen had barely slipped past them once, and that was with a hundred of his warriors in the cover of night. When they were on the move? Now? They would be dead before they even cleared the trebuchets. She stared at her tribe.
“Have to do something. Have to.”
“Chieftain. We can fight. Cause distraction.”
One of Tremborag’s Hobs offered. Pyrite shook his head.
“Not big enough distraction. Need one to occupy army. Especially—him.”
He pointed at Tyrion Veltras. The Hob was staring at the battle. He had hold of his battleaxe and he was strong enough to lift it. He was restless. They all were. But Rags couldn’t figure out what to do.
How? How could she save her tribe? She burned to race towards them. But that was death. Rags bowed her head. By the time they went around the cliffs, it would be too late by hours. Could they really cause a distraction? With what? Ulvama’s spells? She had nothing strong enough? What if—
Memory. Something tugged at Rags’ mind. A thought. She looked around and recalled something.
Long ago. A skeleton racing out of a cliff. Enchanted armor. Crossbows. Dropclaw bats. A bunch of cursed amulets. And—
A cave. Rags looked up. She stared around and then saw it.
“There.”
Her Goblins stared. They looked at a little cave set into the stone. Rags pointed at it.
“What is it?”
“Cave. Leads to dungeon.”
Rags explained to Garen and Pyrite. Her heart was racing. She had no idea if the dungeon led towards Liscor. But maybe—
Garen’s eyes were troubled. The Hobgoblin shifted restlessly.
“Dungeon is very dangerous. Without [Rogue], will die to traps.”
“What about Chieftain good with rocks? What other choice is there?”
Pyrite questioned the Redfang Chieftain. Garen eyed him, but said nothing. Rags leapt down the cliff.
“Go!”
The Goblins entered the cave cautiously. They looked up for Dropclaw bats, but there were none. They must have all flown off. Rags led the way. She was desperate, still despairing inside. They’d never make it. How long would it take them to find a way through the dungeon? But if—
She paused as she entered the main cave and looked around. Something was wrong. Someone had been living here. There were scorch marks on the ground, trash. Signs of habitation.
“A tribe lived here? Or old trash from your tribe?”
Garen frowned around the cave. Rags shook her head.
“Huh. New.”
Pyrite bent down and sniffed at some leftover charcoal. He straightened, frowning about, and then his keen eyes narrowed.
“There.”
He pointed. There was a sound. Rags turned. Garen’s Carn Wolf growled and the Hobgoblin pointed.
“Goblin.”
A little Goblin flinched and cowered against the rocks. She’d hid herself by a plank of wood. Rags blinked. Garen’s wolf growled, but the Hobgoblin held it still. Rags looked at Pyrite. The Goblin was very small, barely more than a child. And her skin was…grey.
“Me?”
“No, me.”
Rags put out an arm and stopped Pyrite. She approached the Cave Goblin slowly. The little Goblin cowered. She was holding something red in her hands. And she’d been lying on something. It looked like a dirty, white…hat?
“Hello?”
Rags halted as the Cave Goblin flinched away from her. The Chieftain of the Flooded Waters tribe blinked down at Pebblesnatch. The little Goblin looked up. Rags was barely taller than her.
“I am Rags. Flooded Waters tribe Chieftain. Who you?”
The Cave Goblin froze with panic. But then she gabbled her name. Rags frowned.
“Why you alone? You live here? Where other Goblins? Tribe?”
