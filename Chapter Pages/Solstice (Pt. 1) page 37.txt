Solstice (Pt. 1)
Page 37
A few looked like winter. Ryoka’s eyes roamed over them all. But she did not see her friend.
And yet—they were here. And so were their guardians. Tyrion Veltras whirled about.
“They’re here.”
He heard Ryoka Griffin whisper. Then the true party began. And it turned out all the wonders before it were like dust to what came after.

It was a day of meetings. And it would be a longer day still.
Luan’s boat rocked in a sudden swell of the waves. He adjusted his posture to stay upright—and suddenly, found himself on still waters.
As if the world were suddenly calm. The water like glass. The [Rower] looked around. And then—suddenly—ahead.
Someone sat on the tiny prow of his vessel. Feet drifting through the water. The figure smiled at Luan.
Just as before.

Aaron grabbed the screwdriver and turned back. He jerked, dropping the screwdriver.
The figure sitting across from him made no move to catch it. Aaron stared.
“You.”
“Hello again, Aaron. I told you we would meet today.”
The young man looked around. No one had come through the door. No window had opened, no magic had been cast. Yet suddenly he had company. And he was not afraid. Not exactly. It was true, what the figure had said. His…mentor. Of sorts.
It was a promise.

Laken Godart sat in a private room, observing the party. He noticed the fae at the same time as Ryoka and jerked.
“Verdammt! They’re here!”
He rose to his feet, shocked at the suddenness of it all. They were always so surprising. Even when you knew they would surprise. He began to stride for the door, using his [Emperor]’s sight to navigate him as surely as if he had eyes.
His hand was on the doorknob when the young man stopped.
Laken Godart’s head turned. His eyes were closed. But they opened a fraction, now. As if to see. He spoke, quietly.
“…Is someone there?”
He waited, heart suddenly beating fast. He sensed…nothing. Just an empty room. But it was today.
And he had felt this once before. The [Emperor] turned. He waited. Then he heard the voice.
“Yes.”
Laken jerked. Someone was sitting in one of the chairs. He did not see the figure with any clarity. But they were there.
“Come. I told you we would meet again. Do not be alarmed.”
“You again.”
“Yes.”
The person Laken Godart had met once before smiled. Laken had known. Somehow. He had known on the Winter Solstice. And now—part of him had been expecting this, too. Even more than Ryoka’s fae.
He sat down, slowly. Was it the same person? He had not had vision then. Now—he could tell no detail. Nothing. Except perhaps one thing.
The stranger had a beard. Laken spoke.
“Tamaroth?”
And he heard the laugh in the reply.
“Yes.”

The Summer Solstice. Ryoka looked at the dancing fae. At the Faerie King’s warriors. And the knowledge of what she must do burned in her heart.
Bring back her friend.
Meet another.
A day of meetings. And power. Ryoka whispered her name.
“Ivolethe.”
And she heard laughter.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: This is the end of Volume 7. Part one, of three. I thought this would be two chapters. I think it’s three. Maybe more?
We’ll see. I can’t predict how long things are going to be. To give the chapter the justice it deserved, I spent longer on the party. Also—I didn’t go to like 30,000 words because I want some quality if I can.
I will leave it at that. My break begins whenever Volume 7 ends. For now—I’m going to share the most pertinent art. One picture, per person.
