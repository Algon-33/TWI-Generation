Solstice (Pt. 9)

A message. A text message. Sent to all the devices from another world. Such a simple thing.
 
The Gods are alive.
 
She dropped the device. She backed away. But the young woman from Earth—
Believed.

Laisa was screaming. The ritual was warping her. She was glad, though. Something was mending it. Something was bridging the terrible damage she and the others were wreaking—
Then the hands appeared. The song of spring ended.
She felt them. She heard laughter. A man’s voice. Something reached out and tore at the very nature of things. The High Mage collapsed as the magic expended itself. Othius howled in triumph.

In a bar, past midnight, Rufelt heard a cry. He shot out of bed.
“Lasica. What’s wrong? Lasica!”
His wife appeared in the doorway to their room. Her eyes were wide, frantic.
“Rufelt. Something’s—”

In Rhir, something stirred. Three Hives vanished in a moment.

The Death of Magic flew into the sky, screaming.
“What have you done? You idiots!”

Across the world, great [Mages] were afraid. Az’kerash and Belavierr dug themselves out of the snow and the Stitch Witch stood oblivious in the cold.
“They have torn the threads.”
And her eyes betrayed fear.

Ryoka felt everything change. One second, Ivolethe was rejoicing. Then—screaming.
And then?
She stood there. The scroll forgotten. She looked at Ryoka—and then tugged her arm.
“Ryoka.”
She dragged the City Runner out of the vault. Ryoka reached for the scroll—but suddenly spectral chains appeared around it and her arm.
“No!”
She struggled to rip it from the magic protecting it.
“Ryoka! We must leave! They are—”
Figures were already shouting, bursting into the vault from the other side. Ryoka heard their voices.
“Protect—treasury—”
“Ivolethe! The scroll! The scroll! Let me—”
Ryoka shouted at Ivolethe, but the fae dragged her through the bridge between worlds, and Ryoka dropped the scroll as the magic pulled it away from her. She was screaming at her friend, but Ivolethe’s eyes were wide with fear. Everything else was forgotten.

The realms of the fae. Ryoka stumbled through the gateway on the hill of flowers. She whirled.
“It was right there! Ivolethe! Erin—”
“Ryoka Griffin. I am sorry. But look.”
Ryoka’s rage faded. Her head turned. And she saw.
The Faerie King, Oberon, stood in front of her. His great head bowed once. In sorrow. Ryoka stared up at him and the host.
She saw the fae warriors, six of them.
Melidore.
Sikeri.
Silver Pine, his head bowed in sorrow and rage.
The Summer Court.
The Satyr.
They were all here. They had walked through the portal. Now—the fae turned as one. They began to slowly march away from the doorway.
“What are you doing?”
Ryoka ran after them. What had just happened? They had been going to—
One look at Melidore’s anguished face, Ivolethe’s, and the Faerie King’s bowed head and Ryoka knew the answer.
No more, no more. The hour is past. Too many lives have been spent. No more shall die. It is too late.
Something terrible had happened. And the power of Oberon himself had been thwarted.
“I am so sorry. I tried to make an end to it. But we cannot return. Each one of us becomes a weapon against you. Each blade, each piece of us—”
Melidore looked at Ryoka. He hung his head wearily. The Wind Runner fell to her knees.
“But Erin? Can’t you just…?”
“Look. They are closing our gate from their side.”
Ivolethe whispered. The stones were shifting. Ryoka saw the portal trembling.
“They will not.”
It took Ryoka a long time to realize the voice had been the Faerie King’s. Fae surrounded the gate on this side. She looked at Ivolethe.
