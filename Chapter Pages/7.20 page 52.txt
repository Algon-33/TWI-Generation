Fire. Her heart beat in her chest. And the [Lady] smiled. She walked, almost stumbling towards the door. That young woman had the fire. More than that. A living spark, as strong as Maviola had ever seen.
But she was inexperienced. That was why she’d been faltered. But she could learn. Grow. The door called to Maviola. One last time. One last—
“Aha! I have it back, you [Thief]!”
Someone shouted in her ear. Maviola whirled. A [Lady] was riding past her. Bethal Walchaís, laughing merrily, was atop her bareback mare. She galloped past Maviola, raising a finger. Maviola blinked. Bethal rode off through the streets, triumphant.
And a figure—Maviola turned and saw a [Chevalier]. Thomast. He looked apologetic as he bowed to her.
“Apologies, Lady El. My wife thinks it would be a merry prank for a day or two. I will ensure it is returned. But Bethal claims it is part of youth.”
“Are you…Thomast? Her husband?”
Maviola blinked. And then looked at Thomast. The man bowed, with a regretful smile. Handsome—a [Fencer] with a silver bell. Some [Ladies] had all the luck.
“Bethal insists on fair turnabout. I apologize, again.”
Lady Firestarter grinned. And her eyes lit up, like burning embers, beautifully orange.
“Well, I stole the horse from her.”
Thomast coughed.
“That is not what I meant, Milady. But Bethal was insistent. I hope you will cope with the loss. It may prove to be…eventful. I did meet Bethal under a similar situation. I apologize again, but Bethal knows how to live, if anyone.”
The words were very confusing. But Maviola was also drawn to Thomast. And Bethal glanced back as she stopped her horse. In sudden, abrupt paranoia.
“Thomast! Hurry up!”
The [Chevalier] bowed and walked away. And Maviola? She blinked and realized something. Thomast had been her type. And that was the problem.
Charming young men. Well—youngish. The suave ones stole more than just your heart for a moment.
“He took my money pouch.”
She stared after Thomast and Bethal. But they were already gone. Maviola had her bag of holding, her three vials. And nothing else.
But that was fine. She looked at the magical door. And Liscor was changed. But—here. Maviola walked forwards, smiling. She saw Grev dash through, calling Erin’s name. And Maviola walked forwards, into the inn. Into—
Into a wall. The [Lady] bounced off the inn’s wall. She stared at the blank door. She opened and closed the door a few times. Nothing happened.
“Well—damn.”
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I don’t know how much you’ve read of this. The last…7,000 words was a step too far. I am about 3 hours past my projected mark.
And this is a BIG CHAPTER. Maybe I’ll cut it. If I do, you’ll read the rest tomorrow. But for now, I’m out. Thank you for reading! This chapter…was a chapter. As always, I tried my best.
Today’s artwork is Maviola, by Microwaved Mrsha Plushie. A glorious Peki…and we have some amazing art for next chapter! But I need to eat food. I’m also…many hours past dinner. Which I want. So enjoy and thanks for reading!
