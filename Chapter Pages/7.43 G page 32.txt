That was…reassuring. Reiss was still frowning but Pyrite opined that the Kraken Eaters were generally trustworthy. Just fight maniacs.
As bad as Redfangs. Numbtongue frowned and punched his head lightly. Nolocks glanced at him.
“What you? [Warrior]? What that?”
He pointed at the guitar. Numbtongue pulled it off and played a few chords. His claws sparked with electricity.
“[Bard].”
“Oooh.”
Nolocks was instantly interested. His face fell when he failed to produce either the same sound or electricity. He relaxed, grinning.
“Okay. Good! I sit here. Behave. You Hob—you boss! What next?”
Numbtongue wasn’t sure. He was sure…it was going to be trouble.
Sure enough, when he opened the door, Erin was arguing. This time with Invrisil’s side.
“No, you can’t have him. I get that he killed people. Well—you took him prisoner.”
“He’s a damned Goblin! That monster killed more people than most [Murderers] we string up! And—dead gods, another one’s escaped!”
The shouting person caught sight of Numbtongue. Erin raised her voice.
“That’s Numbtongue! Put that bow down! Put it down or I’ll hit you with an acid jar and you don’t wanna turn into a laughing clown-dude!”
No one understood that reference, especially Numbtongue. But Erin waving around the highly-caustic acid made everyone back up. Numbtongue looked back and Nolocks grinned.
Fearless. Or rather—he had mastered fear. He was a pure warrior. Something in Numbtongue said that Garen would have loved Nolocks.
She was going to protect them. The other side was threatening everything from sending the guards to destroying the door. Erin didn’t care.
“Do it. I said no killing Goblins. And I mean it! Destroy the door!”
“Hold on, hold on! I’m on the wrong side!”
Grev yelped and tried to push forwards. Erin was adamant. She’d do it. Numbtongue hesitated, unsure of what to say. He saw her turn, ignoring Lyonette’s grievances which she was airing. She gave Numbtongue a thumbs-up.
“I mean it. No one’s killing him. He’s a Goblin. You killed his people. He killed you guys. That’s not right, but—”
“He didn’t kill just warriors.”
A voice from the other side of the door. Numbtongue saw—
Pointed ears. Blonde-golden hair.
Elia Arcsinger. He stumbled backwards as fear took him. The Named Adventurer looked at Erin Solstice. Erin blocked the door, but wavered.
“Huh? What does that mean?”
The half-Elf pointed. Straight past Numbtongue. Towards the Goblin who bared his teeth in the garden. She knocked aside her daughter as the half-Elf strung the bow.
“I was too late. While I defeated the Hobgoblins—eight Goblins escaped. They fought past the Watch. But they wouldn’t have gotten this far if they hadn’t taken hostages. They took children hostage to escape. Then—they killed them.”
Goblin tactics. Erin Solstice froze. Numbtongue’s hair stood on end. He turned his head and Nolocks, now standing as every eye turned towards him—
Laughed. He slapped his thighs and grinned.
“Sure did. Killed them easy-dead. Humans kill Goblin children. We kill Human children. Same, same. I—”
He dove as someone loosed an arrow. The inn erupted into chaos. Numbtongue saw the door close.
And then there was true silence. Erin stood there, and her confidence was gone. She looked at Numbtongue and the Hob realized she didn’t know what to do.
It fell to him.
 
—-
No—it fell to three Goblins. They stood there in conference. One spoke out loud. One spoke in his head, his soul. One thought.
“He is a Goblin. A warrior. He did what Goblins do.”
