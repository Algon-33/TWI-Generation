“Oh. Sorry. The Great Enemy? Sorry, I forgot that’s what we called them. Say, if we managed to find their capital, who’s going to slaughter all the women and children? I’d volunteer, but I think I’d have to get in line after Hayvon and the others.”
“Tom. We talked about this—”
“Oh yes.”
A prick on the side. Richard was waiting for it. He slapped the arm down before the dagger could thrust. Tom danced away. Richard kicked at him.
“Tom—”
Giggling. The [Clown] actually did a backflip. Vanished again.
That damn enchanted belt.
“We talk all the time, Richard! Doesn’t stop us from fighting the good fight! Death to the Demons! Hey! Do you think once we get home, we’ll all get medals? Or imprisoned for war crimes?”
“Tom—”
Someone moved and threw something at him. Richard had had enough.
“Light!”
He shouted. And the room filled with light. Richard had almost forgotten the magic spell in the mansion. Tom froze, creeping towards Richard.
The [Clown] was thin. His face was painted with his makeup. And he wore that obnoxiously garish clown suit. Only this one was worn. Crudely repaired. And blood spattered parts of it.
Tom’s own face had changed too. He had to have lost at least sixty pounds. But more than that—the somewhat kind face had turned cold. His eyes glittered. But as the light caught him, he froze.
The two looked at each other.
“Tom.”
“Richard. Hey, that wasn’t me. That was—other Tom.”
“Right.”
Once upon a time, Richard would have accepted that. There was Tom, the young man from Earth. And then there was Tom, the clown. Two different personalities. But of late—they’d looked like the same person.
This is his choice. Chole’s words. Where did the [Clown] end and Tom begin? Richard couldn’t tell anymore. Tom had always been…weird. And that was before the face-paint had gone on.
“I came to talk, Tom. If you try stabbing me again, I’m leaving.”
The [Clown] blinked. He peered at Richard, and then shuffled left.
“Me? Stab anyone? I’d never—”
“Throw that and I’ll hit you.”
The [Clown] made the knife vanish with a flick of the hand.
“Nothing up my sleeves. What’s up, Richard? Has Mister [Cowboy Knight] come to give me my marching orders? Ask me to take my medicine? Or does dear Emily want something? Lord Hayvon the Just?”
“No, Tom. I just wanted to talk. Can I sit?”
Richard looked around. Tom’s room was a mess. The [Clown] had thrown a table; that was what Richard had heard. And while he had multiple rooms; this was supposed to be a reception room, everything was trashed. Cut up with a knife—there were wine bottles scattered around. Glass shards—Richard glanced at Tom.
“I cut my feet a few times. What’s pain between friends?”
His feet were bloody. Richard felt for a healing potion.
“Here—”
“Thanks!”
The [Clown] reached out and grabbed the potion off Richard’s belt. He could do that. It was one of his Skills that made him so dangerous. Tom stared at the expensive potion. He uncorked it and then—smashed it into the ground.
“Whoops. Got another?”
“Tom!”
Richard lost his patience. Tom giggled.
“What’s the matter? The Blighted Kingdom has more potions than sense! Just ask and they’ll give you another.”
“Tom. You’re—”
Getting worse? The [Clown] laughed as if he could hear Richard’s thoughts. So the [Knight]—not a [Cowboy Knight], incidentally—sat down on one of the few couch-chairs left.
“How are you, Tom?”
For some reason, that question sobered Tom. The [Clown] blinked. Then he sat down. He gave Richard a rictus of a grin.
“How do I look, Richard?”
