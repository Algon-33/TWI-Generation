The two stood in the empty hallway. Richard kept glancing at the door, but no sounds emerged. Of course…it was magically silenced. But it just made you more inclined to look. Tom had a habit of sneaking up on you and that had been before his Ring of Invisibility and other artifacts. And he could gut anyone but Hayvon in a moment. He had tried to before…not with Richard, but still.
“Richard.”
Chole put her hands on her hips. He looked back at her.
“Richard, listen. I’m a [Nurse]. I didn’t complete my education, but I’m still the most medically-qualified person in this world to talk about mental illness.”
Chole twisted her hand in the white apron. She glanced over her shoulder and lowered her voice.
“…That’s not just mental illness. It’s not just schizophrenia, or…or being manic-depressive.”
“What do you mean by ‘just’, Chole?”
“It doesn’t look like that. People do not turn into serial-killers wearing face paint if they have a problem, Richard.”
“Obviously.”
He hadn’t thought of it like that, though. Chole nodded at the door.
“I think Tom’s choosing to be like that, Richard. Either that—or he has one of the ‘sacrificial classes’ that Lord Hayvon told us about. That might be a Skill. But it’s not plain mental illness.”
Chose to be like…? Both jumped as something went crash from behind the door. Chole hesitated.
“Maybe If I went with you—”
“I’ll talk to him alone, Chole. You know how he gets if there are more people around. He’ll just try to play us off against each other.”
“Fine. But we have to do something about Tom. He can’t keep doing this.”
“I know.”
The [Nurse] left. She had other things to do than just try to get through to Tom. Hayvon had wanted to know about blood transfusions, Earth’s non-magical medicines despite the Blighted Kingdom’s surplus of potions.
That left just Richard. So he walked over to the door and knocked.
“Tom? I’m coming in.”

The room was dark when the [Knight] pushed open the door. Not pitch-black, but nearly. So in the time it took your eyes to adjust, you were in blackness. Richard glanced around.
“Tom…? Come on, don’t play games.”
A futile request. The door swung closed behind Richard. And as the [Knight] turned—not whirled—he heard a sound.
Doododooodledododootdododooo…
Music. An annoying, semi-energetic song. It played around Richard, a nebulous sound. Loud, in the dark room.
“Tom—”
Someone was in the room. Richard heard a giggle. And as he turned, his eyes seeing shadows, he saw—
A knife. Two eyes. A figure, sitting in a corner of the room. Richard heard laughter. It was fast, manic. Perhaps someone had practiced it. But it had become him.
“Who’s come to speak to me? Is that my best bud?”
The [Clown] giggled. The knife moved. Richard saw a flicker.
“T—”
He dodged the knife. It had gone for his side. It thunked into a wall. Richard reached for his sword. Tom had actually thrown it.
“Whoops. Sorry! Slip of the hand. You know how it is.”
The [Clown] vanished. Richard swore.
“Tom, this isn’t funny.”
Laughter.
“To you, Richard. I think it’s hilarious. It’s me, by the way. Tom.”
“Which one?”
“Does it matter?”
Flicker. Richard spun. Tom had another dagger. Maybe the same one. He had secret blades all around him. The young man scuttled across the room, giggling and Richard lost track of him again.
“Knock it off, Tom.”
He was thinner. He kept losing weight. Tom had been overweight before. Now—
“I can’t help it. It’s him. By which I mean, me. What’s up, Mister [Knight]? Are we off to murder people with pointy objects?”
“We’re not fighting Demons.”
