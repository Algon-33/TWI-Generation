The little Gnoll, lover of all foods, looked at Pawn. Her eyes narrowed as Pawn offered her some of the tender hamburger. Mrsha turned her head, picked up a fork, and with rather deliberate care and pointedness, began cutting her egg into pieces and feeding herself with the utensils.
Pawn was taken aback.
“Well, if you would like some…”
He put it to the side of his plate, for Mrsha to grab. The white Gnoll girl looked at him.
Yeah, sure, pal. Keep trying.
“Not hungry, Mrsha?”
Lyonette blinked as she came back and saw the Gnoll was eating slowly. Mrsha gave her a look too, but Lyonette still didn’t get it. She turned back to Pawn.
“Honestly, I don’t know how your class works, Pawn. It’s so—unique. Mine? I’m very glad about being a [Worldly Princess]. Otherwise, only royal acts would allow me to level. Which is why most of the royalty are under-leveled compared to everyone else. Well—we also level slower.”
“Really?”
Both Mrsha and Pawn looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] nodded.
“Don’t you know? I know I’ve taught you about class rarity, Mrsha.”
She had her little lessons with the Gnoll about things Lyonette had learned every few days. Mrsha nodded, but Lyonette explained it again for Pawn’s benefit.
“We level up more slowly the better a class is. You know the King of Destruction? My father said he was probably only above Level 50—not even Level 60. That’s just a guess, but it still makes him one of, if not the highest-leveled [Kings] in the world. The Blighted King would be around his level.”
“Could he be above Level 60?”
“Maaaybe. But no more than that. He’s the King of Destruction, but he doesn’t have to be high-level to have the ability to use his [Army of the King] or his Dreamers of Reim. Because he’s a [King], Flos Reimarch will have better Skills. I’d love to know how well a [Priest] ranks compared to say, a [Blademaster]. It does matter, you see.”
The Worker scratched at one antennae.
“I did not know that. But you have low levels, Lyonette. And you told me [Princesses] were mostly low-level, even if yours was particularly so.”
The [Princess] sighed.
“We level slowly, it’s true. Not just because our classes are some of the best in this world—we just don’t go into danger that much. And ruling a kingdom doesn’t let you level that much normally. There’s a list of monarchs and equivalent leader-classes above Level 40 that we keep. You know, dossiers on enemies and allies.”
Normal stuff. Mrsha and Pawn exchanged a glance, for a second in synch. Then Mrsha glared and turned her head. Lyonette went on.
“There are less than thirty rulers on that list. I think. A bit over thirty? Less than forty, in the entire world. Each one is a world power in their way. Only [Kings] and [Queens], by the way. [Lords] and [Ladies] don’t count, or anyone with a lesser class.”
“How inferior are they to your class?”
The young woman chewed as she thought about that.
“A Level 60 [Mayor] might be equal to a Level 30 [King]. Maybe they’d have a better city, but a [King]’s power extends across their entire kingdom. It’s about concentration of power. In her inn, Erin’s powerful. With her [Garden of Sanctuary] and her aura skill. She can suppress Gold-ranks from using their full abilities if she does it correctly and she’s not trained. She’ll get more powerful too, with her Level 40 Skills. But outside of the inn…?”
She shrugged.
