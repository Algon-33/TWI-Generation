Pelt’s voice was completely flat. His eyes stared straight through Erin, at something else. She recognized that, too. Slowly, cautiously, Erin bent.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have taken it.”
“You did nothing—”
Maughin stopped as Erin looked at him. The Dullahan threw up his hands in a rare display of frustration and stomped away. Erin knew he was angry, but she was focused all on Pelt.
“I’ll uh, I’ll find some wood for the handle, master.”
Emessa backed away into the other section of the forge. Pelt was just sitting now, staring at the knife. Erin looked at him.
“Why does it matter that much?”
He didn’t answer.
“You have to break it?”
“This is my sin.”
His voice was hollow. Erin nodded.
“I am sorry. I didn’t know. Or—I knew, but I didn’t think it was a big deal.”
“You and that giant armored bastard.”
That was a bit like the old Pelt. Erin let it go. She sat down next to Pelt.
“I think it’s beautiful.”
Pelt finally looked at her. His voice trembled.
“You know nothing. Don’t act like you know metal, you Human vixen. You’re no better than females from home! Always tricking, sly—”
His hands shook on the blade. Erin saw the sheathed edge digging into his palm. And his words stung. She glared at him. But then—relented. There was a mortal pain in his eyes. She tried one last time.
“I really am sorry. I didn’t think about how you’d feel. About the blade. And the competition. I did trick you. I feel awful, seeing how you—I’m so sorry.”
He didn’t respond.  Pelt was just trembling, staring at the steel, working through something of his own. Erin lowered her head. He was ignoring her, now. And why not?
I’m sorry. I’m sad. Those were just words, after all. Who knew what you meant by them? It could just be a lie. Erin had every right to be angry. And she should be! She was! But she also wanted Pelt to know she was sorry for the things that were her fault. She had hurt him as badly as Toren. With thoughtlessness. But that could still cut as deeply as anything she’d intended.
But he’d never believe her. She’d never reach him. And Erin felt it in her breast.
A burning.
Was it instinct that made her cup her hands? Instinct, or some understanding on a subconscious level? Erin didn’t know. But she felt it.
Burning in her chest. In her soul. Her hands tingled. And she felt it. At the tips of her fingers. Something…new. Something she had felt only once before, but could give a name to instantly.
Magic.
It rose in her now. Like the magic of the faerie’s feast. Like the magic of an [Immortal Moment], like a perfect game of chess. It was a feeling of something beyond perfection. Something eternal. It told her what to do.
Erin cupped her hands. And she called the memory into her palms. Memory. The feeling of her guilt over Pelt’s expression, fresh and vivid. But also—she couldn’t help it. The memory of a skeleton’s last smile. A broken heart.
Grief and guilt and sadness. It was just memory. But in her hands it ignited. Emotion so real that it took shape. And fire appeared.
A blue flame, with a dark core of sapphire emerged from Erin’s palms. Small at first, but growing. Larger. A nimbus of brighter flame surrounded the dark core, until the edges were a pale blue. Emessa turned, a piece of wood in her hand. She dropped it and stared.
Erin Solstice looked down at the flame in her hands. To her, it was a familiar sight. She had called on it before. But it was still beautiful. The blue flame was not hot, to her. And it shone like no fire Earth had ever conceived. The glow was soft, unlike mortal fire. And it grew larger. It was memory burning into flame.
