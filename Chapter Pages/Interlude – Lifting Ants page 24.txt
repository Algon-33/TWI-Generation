Interlude – Lifting Ants
Page 24
Mrsha was glad of it. It would have made them too real, or a mockery. But it mattered to the Painted Antinium. Bird shrugged.
“It does not matter. Erin remembers them.”
Each Soldier and Worker was different. Each one caught a different way. It was proof. Pawn’s voice shook.
“Bird. Thank you for showing us this. But you broke your orders to do it. We could have waited—Klbkch will be—”
He got no further. He was trembling. So were many of the Antinium. Anand looked at Knight. He reached out to touch his friend and halted.
But Bird was calm. He shook his head.
“I came to show you this because you must see it now. Not when Klbkch says. Because this is what made us.”
He looked around. The Workers, the chess club, stood in silence. And Anand looked at Bird. They all did. Mrsha waited, listening, learning something she’d never had put into words, even with a voice. Bird spoke. Loudly, to the gathered Antinium. Painted and not, Workers from the roof, Soldiers. All of them.
“Klbkch made a mistake. He made many mistakes, but this is what I thought when I was sleeping here. What makes us we is not Erin. She can do it, but she cannot do it. Without her, we would not have taken names or become Individual. But Erin cannot do it easily again. Not to other Antinium. Which is why they are Autonomous. Or something.”
The Antinium stared up at Bird. Then they looked at each other. Mrsha wrinkled her brow. Bird went on.
“To be me, all I had to do was want to be me. To say ‘I’. To believe I could be free. That is what made me Individual. Not Erin. But also Erin. Do you understand? That is why it does not happen again. Because this never happened. Except when it did.”
He pointed at the circle of the chess club. And then, at the Soldiers standing with Yellow Splatters. The [Sergeant] looked at Bird. And the Worker nodded.
“That is what it is.”
Yellow Spatters spoke.
“Bravery.”
Bird looked at him for a moment.
“No. Bravery is not being afraid. Courage.”
The [Sergeant] paused. And his voice shook as he pointed at the sky, the light coming through the dome. The sky.
“Heaven exists. Let all Antinium who perish believe in that. It is there.”
Bird’s voice was calm.
“Maybe it does. I have not seen it. But there is a better place than wherever heaven is. Here.”
He swept his arm around the hill. And the Worker shouted.
“Here! Because we will never be forgotten.”
He stood in the roaring silence. Bird paused, as the Antinium stood, looking at him. The two Armored Antinium knelt, and Bird looked at them, his fellow Workers and Soldiers. And he spoke cheerfully, but seriously.
“I have been thinking, Tersk, Pawn, Anand, Belgrade, Garry, Yellow Splatters, Archer B12, Purple Smile…and everyone else. I have been thinking of what I am. And what I want to be. And I do not want to be hit by Klbkch. He is stupid. And he is not my family.”
Sacrilege. Bird went on.
“I do not know what Heaven is. I have not seen it. If there are angels, I would very much like to meet them. Because they have wings. But I do not need paint. It is fine if you do. But I do not like Klbkch. So I have decided.”
He spread his arms.
“I am Bird. Not of the Free Antinium, but Bird. I like the Hive. I like Pawn, and many others. Not Dekass. Tersk is okay. But I like here more. Here, I am free. Klbkch is not my father. He is not my Revalantor. And Erin is not my mother. She is like a mother, but she did not make me. She is my family, though. And I will protect her. She has no heaven for me. But she is good enough without it.”
Mrsha looked at Bird. The Worker smiled. He lifted his arms and shouted the last.
