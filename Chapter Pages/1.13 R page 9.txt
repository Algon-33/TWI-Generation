But it’s all I want. And now that I hear it, the truth of it rings in my mind. Yes. Ever since I was young maybe—
 
I was always afraid. And when I reached out I got hurt.
 
But it’s what I want.
 
And suddenly, I am filled with regret. Truly, painfully. It comes and bites me after I’ve pushed it away for so long and the pain stabs my heart for the first time. True guilt. True regret.
I shouldn’t have run. I should have gone after Ceria. But instead I do what Ryoka Griffin does best: run away.
A friend. Something I’ve never had. Never truly. Never—never someone I could really trust. And the Horns of Hammerad—Garia—they were the closest. But when I came close to opening my heart I slammed the door shut on their fingers.
I regret.
Slowly, I kneel in the soft red grass. It is soft. Like death. Clumsily, I clasp my hands together. It’s been so long. I’ve forgotten how.
But I begin. I put my hands together and pray.
Oh God. Gods and goddesses. Spirits and bodhisattvas, and deities long dead from this world. Anyone who’s listening, really.
Please—
Don’t let me die alone.
Don’t let me die—
Without having made a single friend.

After a while I stand up. I have never prayed before. I don’t do it. If there is a God, surely the duty of humans is to rebel against him. A quote from Philip Pullman’s trilogy His Dark Materials. Words that resonated in my soul when I heard them.
But this time my plea comes from the heart. I want a friend. I want to not die alone. And if I can—
I’d like to apologize.
I need to go back.
I look back the way I’ve come. The road is long. I spent four days coming here. And I’m running low on food and water. But I can make it back. Time is no obstacle. My delivery will have to wait.
I have to make things right.
I take two steps away from the red soil and pause. My feet have stopped moving. I try to move, and suddenly I can’t. I’m rooted in place.
I want to go back. But another part of me wants to keep searching. I must complete my delivery. I promised.
But I didn’t. I was told. And suddenly—I realize.
Teriarch. When he first met me he controlled my every action. And yes, he ordered me to deliver his message. And I have carried out his order quite fitfully ever since meeting him, haven’t I? And that’s odd, because Ryoka Griffin is notoriously stubborn. She doesn’t like being ordered around.
But I’ve been going towards the Blood Fields as fast as I can. Because of Teriarch.
Ever since I met with him I’ve been heading in a straight line. Towards the Blood Fields. Towards my goal, this Az’kerash or whatever his true name is.
In short, following the task Teriarch set me.
“Magic.”
I am under a spell.
I try to move my feet. They refuse to budge. The spell is locking me down quite easily. And—was it doing something to my mind? Making me not want to turn back?
Perhaps. But I’ve realized my errors. I have to go back. And no magic will stop me.
Easier said than done. I try to lift my foot. Surprisingly, that’s really easy. But moving it to take a step?
Impossible.
I struggle. For an hour I try to move my feet. An hour. It’s an eternity. I try moving back and I can. I can run around. But the instant I try to move with the purpose of going back—
Immobility. I’m locked down. I can’t resist.
But I will.
It’s like pushing a boulder uphill with matchsticks for arms. Impossible. This is magic. How could you resist that? But I will.
I have to go back. I grit my teeth and push. My foot lifts—
And I take a step.
