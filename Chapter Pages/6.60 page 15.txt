Ryoka Griffin glanced up, startled. Gralton just stared at her. Not a dog trapped in a man’s body, oh no. But a man who’d learned something of dogs. She wondered just how good his nose was. She wondered what Skills a [Dog Lord] gained.
“So Laken’s rebuilding?”
“That’s right. Yitton Byres is still there, but he’ll ride towards his estates within the week. Laken is organizing his village. There are a lot of refugees.”
Hundreds already. Possibly thousands. More people were coming to Riverfarm, which had survived the fires. Also because they’d heard there was work. Safety. Despite the [Witches]. Gralton grunted.
“Fine. What about the Goblins?”
He looked sideways at Ryoka, fishing in a belt pouch for a treat. The young woman paused.
“They’re separated from Riverfarm. Laken is having them watched, but they have their own area. They haven’t all run away.”
“So there’s a point to how long we took getting back. Fine.”
The [Dog Lord] sat, scratching a huge—Ryoka had to think it was a wolf, although the dog looked more like a bulldog. But was massive. It came over and Gralton laughed as it walked right up to him. He looked up after a while, and saw Mousey was rolled over as Ryoka scratched her belly.
“You staying? It’s late.”
“If you’ll have us, we’d take a bed. We wouldn’t want to—”
“Stay, then.”
Gralton snorted. Ryoka shut up. After a while, Charlay trotted in. She looked around.
“Oh. They’re better now. Hey, Gralton.”
“Centaur. Watch your hooves.”
Ryoka found herself sitting with Charlay and Gralton as more dogs came over. They were warier of Ryoka than Charlay. There was a bright intelligence in their eyes, more so than even dogs in Ryoka’s world. Gralton just snorted when he saw Ryoka’s surprise.
“I’m a [Dog Lord], woman. You think that’s a pretty name? [Beast Trainers] turn their animals smart. Strong. My hounds think. They remember a friend and they aren’t idiots. See?”
He nodded at Charlay. A bunch of dogs were mobbing her for attention, licking her. The Centauress was giggling.
“Stop that! Stop that! I feel like I’m going to be eaten! Hey, wait—that’s my tail! Back off or I’ll kick!”
Ryoka found herself smiling. Then she looked at Gralton. He almost smiled back. She looked at him, amid his half-empty kennels and the dogs and ducked her head.
“If we’re imposing—”
“Stay. I owe Laken for the [Witches]. You uncomfortable around dogs?”
He jerked his head at her, a challenge. Ryoka hesitated.
“These ones are alright. And I do know a team of adventurers who own dogs.”
“Really? Which ones?”
A light appeared in Gralton’s eyes. Ryoka shrugged.
“The Pithfire Hounds.”
“Never heard of ‘em. Silver-ranks? Bronze?”
“Silver. I ran a delivery for them once. They…lost a dog fighting monsters. Their entire team got hurt. It was just—”
The [Dog Lord] raised his head.
“Did the dogs do the fighting while the adventurers stayed back? Or did they run and let the dogs stay back?”
He stared at Ryoka. Her mouth went dry.
“No. All of them were fighting. And another dog survived. They like dogs. They’ve been grieving their friend. It was an emergency. Wailer Frogs.”
It occurred to Ryoka that whenever she talked, she tended to have a big mouth. Charlay had said as much. Gralton relaxed slightly, listening to the explanation of the battle. He looked at Ryoka again.
“You run emergency deliveries to adventurers. Makes sense why Laken called for you. Here—feed Mousey this. And tell her—kalde. That means she can eat.”
