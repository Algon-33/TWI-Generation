He paused. The room full of silence. The grave expressions. The shaking Antinium Worker sitting at a table, rocking back and forth as Bird tried to calm him down. Relc slowly absorbed what had happened in fragments. As Mrsha hugged her two friends, who were terrified and shaking at the bloodshed. As Erin wiped tears from her eyes. The Drake was too late for all of it.
“I tried, Relc. But I couldn’t—I’m such an idiot. They’re coming here. They promised. They can stay here forever. W-what thing?”
Relc looked at Erin. He looked around the inn. He opened and closed his mouth and put the brochure back in his belt pouch.
“I’ll tell you about it another time. So, Klb went off the deep end? I’d never have…you okay?”
“Yeah. Yeah. I have to wait for them. I’m gonna check…”
Erin staggered up. She went to the basement. Relc looked around.
No one was really moving in the inn. Lyonette was in the basement, waiting. Some of the Players were trying to go on. The show had to go on, distract the audience.
But what drew Relc were the other actors in this…horrible tragedy. A real-life tragedy. The kind that couldn’t be resolved in a three-act, or five-act, or even ten-act structure. He walked over to the table.
“Hey. You.”
Bird looked up. The shaking Worker, rocking back and forth, didn’t. Relc hesitated and sat down.
“Anand, right?”
The Worker hadn’t gone with the others. He had…broken most from Klbkch’s words. But not as Aberration. He looked up, and his voice was small.
“That is right. Senior Guardsman Relc. I am Anand. I am—worthless.”
“Huh. Is that what Klb said?”
“Yes. He is your fellow comrade, Senior Guardsman Relc. I do not wish to waste your time. I am worthless. Worthless…”
“Klbkch is stupid, Anand. He is wrong.”
Bird was doing his best. But his weren’t exactly the best or well-thought out words for Anand. Anand, who loved Klbkch more than the others. Who idolized…Relc knew all this vaguely. He didn’t really speak to many Antinium. They had their thing, he had his. He looked at the little Worker, curled up in misery.
“Seems like Klbkch really shook you up. But hey—Klbkch can be wrong, right? You don’t need him—right, Bird?”
“That is right. I am Bird, and I do not need Klbkch. I am happy here. But…Anand likes Klbkch. Anand is silly.”
Bird chimed in. Relc frowned.
“What’s Klb got going for him, Anand? Little buddy?”
The Worker shuddered.
“Klbkch is intelligent. He is the Revalantor. He is a superior Antinium. Centenium. He should be admired. His word is law. I wished to be of use to him. But I am not. I am worthless. I wished…”
He trailed off, shaking. Relc looked at him. Just looked. Slowly, he pulled a chair closer to Anand and sat.
“What’d you want that Klb didn’t give you, huh? He never talked about it. Talked about you sometimes. But he just said what you wanted wasn’t realistic.”
Anand shuddered. His voice was full of longing.
“He did? I wanted—I asked…to call him…‘father’. ‘Dad’. And to be hugged, later. I understand that request was in error. Arrogant. Wrong. I am wrong. Worthless.”
The Drake stared. Relc looked at Anand, and then at Bird, who shrugged, clearly mystified by Anand’s outlandish desires. But Relc…he sat forwards. And he thought. Just thought, for a bit. When he spoke, it was slowly.
“Huh. Call old Klb ‘dad’, huh? I can understand why he said no. Klb…Klb’s Klb. But you know something, Anand?”
“No, Senior Guardsman Relc, I do not know.”
Relc smiled a bit. He rubbed at his neck spines, then went on.
“You know, kid…I’ve met a lot of boys like you, back in the army. Did I ever tell you about it?”
“Boys like me? Antinium?”
