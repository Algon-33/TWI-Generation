“What is so urgent, anyways?”
Aaron made his lips move despite the magic locking down every part of his body.
“Therapy.”
Inside, on the beach, Sidney was speaking for the first time. She held the ball of [Light] and shivered. Shivered uncontrollably. Telim paused in the open door leading to the stone hallway. He heard the girl’s voice.
“It was so dark. There were four of us. Mamy—told us to hide. It was dark, and I was crying. She put me in the hole while the others ran. And there were lots of them. She said not to move.”
And what came out of the cavern tunnels they had been transported to? What vile monsters?
Rats. Just…rats. Not even the largest ones. But so many. A flood. And they chased the children. Mamy, Sidney’s older sister, had no levels. No weapons, even. Her brothers ran and were overtaken.
Sidney had found a hole. She had hid there, the only person able to fit. But the rats were even smaller than she. So what had her sister done?
“She told me to stay there.”
“And what did she do? Sidney?”
Elena’s face was pale. They were all listening. Aaron saw the girl look up. A [Survivor].
“She sat down.”
She began to cry. That was all. Her sister sat down and didn’t move. And whilst the rats had scurried about, after the girl had fainted after screaming and crying—she had gained the ability to make light. And chased away the rats and ran and ran until the kindly [Farmers] found her.
Sidney was sobbing as Elena held her. But she was afraid—afraid to even bury her face in the young woman’s clothes. The light—she never went without it.
Aaron sat on the ground. At some point, the spell had ended. He saw a figure in the doorway as he looked up. And he rose. He didn’t have the experimental electrical weapons. But if that man interrupted, Aaron would jump—
High Mage Telim backed out of the doorway. He turned and Aaron saw his sick, horrified face for a second. Then the man ran. He got a dozen paces before he vomited in the hallway. Aaron stared at his back. The man had tears in his eyes.

“I had no notion. I heard there was—trouble in some of their recoveries. But are they all…all like that?”
A few minutes later, Telim stared into the beach room. People were comforting Sidney as best they could. High Mage Telim’s face was very pale.
Even the stories had horrified the man. Aaron hadn’t expected that. But Telim was not a [Battlemage]. Or even used to combat. He shuddered as Aaron nodded.
“This is why I don’t leave the academy. Ever. Dead gods. Rats?”
He wiped at his mouth. He had puke in his beard, but it dried up and fell out as he waved a hand over his front, doing the same to his clothes.
“That poor girl. That poor…and her sister. Her brothers?”
He passed a hand over his face. And tears—Aaron saw them trickling down the man’s pudgy face. Telim looked into the room.
“Therapy. I thought—my colleagues called your world soft. But that would be a nightmare for any soul. That poor girl. Is—is she well? She was taken by then Orenaius faction. [Light Mages]. No wonder.”
“She comes to therapy every time. It helps. It would be better if she could be around Elena, or Malia more, High Mage Telim.”
Aaron explained. The man looked at him.
“Of course! Dead gods, but the girl needs…what is she drinking?”
“Um. Lemonade? I can get you some.”
Aaron didn’t want the man to interrupt. Not that it seemed Telim would. He blinked, rubbed at his face.
“Dead gods, I need a drink. What’s ‘lemonade’…made of lemons?”
“And sugar. And some Amentus fruit?”
“Sweet. No alcohol? Nothing else?”
“No. Mage Telim, if you need a drink—”
