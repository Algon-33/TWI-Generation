“Damn it! It’s Amerys and Illphres again!”
“Careful! You nearly hit my plate!”
“Someone put up a shield spell before those students get killed!”
Calvaron chuckled as Beatrice threw up a magical barrier that caught an incoming bolt of magic. He glanced over at Ceria and Pisces as they stared at the magical war breaking out among the mages.
“Don’t worry. People hardly ever get killed. They’re just having a disagreement; I doubt they even realized you lot were coming in today. Just don’t disturb them while they’re working, don’t wander off into far off parts of the isle, ask for help, don’t choose a side right away, and never get in the way of the Golems.”
He paused and scratched at his head as one of the mages shot a stream of purple bubbles out of a wand that immobilized an entire table of students.
“Anything else they should know, Beatrice?”
She shrugged.
“Don’t die. And welcome to Wistram.”
