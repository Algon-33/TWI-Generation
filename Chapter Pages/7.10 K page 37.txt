The Gnolls quailed. Slowly, they moved forwards. Nelrra reached out and touched the younger Gnoll’s paw. He looked at the Gnoll with white fur and his expression changed from fear to…he lowered his head.
“It is as you say, King of Destruction. No. You are right. The traditions of old we left behind in Izril. I am…ashamed. We will bring him back to my tribe.”
“No. He stays.”
The Gnolls looked at him. The one with white fur just stared ahead. His eyes had clouded over again. Flos turned.
“Orthenon. Find who did this.”
The [Steward] raced for his horse without another word. Teres was silent, white-faced. There were little Gnoll children among the dead. She—
Mars covered Teres’ eyes. The young woman fought her. But Mars held her tight.
“Just for a second, Teres. Look later. Don’t speak.”
Teres clung to her, feeling soft skin, even arm. An illusion. But she clung to it. Weeping.
The King of Destruction’s tears had ceased, but the proof of them was still there. He looked at the young Gnoll with the white fur.
“What is your name, lad?”
At first, the Gnoll didn’t respond. Flos gently put a hand on his shoulder.
“Look at me.”
The head rose, but mechanically. There was something there, but it was fading away, now. By degrees. The King of Destruction spoke, looking into those eyes.
“Stay with me an hour longer. Stay, for I am your king. I did not know your tribe. But you claimed me, and I failed you. But I will see justice done. What is your name?”
Something reappeared. Teres heard a voice as she looked at him. At that terribly lost look in his gaze.
“Sailt. Sailt, of the Saltstone Tribe.”
“Come with me, Sailt. Your tribe must be buried. Ulyse, preserve them. Remove the insects.”
The [Mages] raised their staffs silently. Flos had brought his veterans. But even they walked slowly here, staring. This was not a battle that anyone could be proud of.
Orthenon returned. He raced through the setting sunlight. A black shadow on a dark horse.
“Your Majesty. Survivors. We have the attackers.”
The Gnolls’ heads turned. Sailt looked up.
“Survivors?”
Flos whirled. His green eyes found Orthenon’s. The [Steward] nodded.
“A village not far from here. My Lord. Some of the Gnolls live. They were captured as slaves. All children. The village is surrounded by your riders.”
“Who—”
Sailt’s voice faltered. He began to cough, but he tried to make his way to Orthenon. Nelrra steadied him, searching for a drink. Teres gave him her water flask.
“Slaves? What crime did they commit?”
Flos stared at Orthenon.
“The village [Headman] claims they stole from his lands.”
Orthenon was breathing slowly. His voice was level and measured. But there was something dark in his eyes. Waiting. Flos looked back at the dead Gnolls.
“Stole. Did they?”
He looked at Sailt. The young Gnoll coughed and choked on his reply. He spat.
“No. They refused to trade with us. We did nothing.”
A glowing light. Mars held up the stone glowing soft blue, and Ulyse’s staff flashed white. The truth.
Flos nodded. His expression was just—distant. It had not changed. He looked back at Orthenon.
“How many children?”
“Fifteen children, your Majesty. They have white fur.”
“They would, after…”
Nelrra murmured. Flos turned. Teres saw him looking at her. Flos had no emotion on his face.
“Bring them to me. The entire village.”
The [Steward] rode with half the [Riders]. Zamea pointed and two of the half-Giants strode after them. Flos just stood there.
“He told me they had few of my refugees. He promised me they were given every courtesy.”
“Perhaps he did not know, my lord—”
