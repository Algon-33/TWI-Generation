The gleaming sword slowly came up in Briganda’s hands as she stared at it, wide-eyed. Weapons taken from the greatest swordsman of his era.
Last of all—Keldrass bent down, and picked up the familiar artifact. He had spotted it at the start. It was familiar. The Drake had never used it, but he had worn it. Poetic that he owned it. Slowly, he lifted it up and breathed the words.
“The Helm of Fire.”
The adventurers looked at each other in silence. Then…yes, then.
It was over.

The people of the world watched the raid end with mixed feelings. Grief. Desolation, as the friends of the Horns realized more were gone.
Greed, seeing the artifacts claimed. Hope there might be more in the now-weakened village.

Fury at the Courier, the thief.
So many emotions. A handful of artifacts, dead bodies. That was all that remained from the raid, surely? All that effort for nothing?
In another world, perhaps. Here?
