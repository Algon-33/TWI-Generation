Interlude – Two Rats

His eyes widened. She shook. The memories hit Mrsha. The smell. The fear. She bared her teeth and little thorns grew from her paws. The Gnoll nodded. He held the spear out.
“Here. You want to try?”
It was too large, too heavy for her. Mrsha hesitated and grabbed at it. She tried to lift it. The prison was silent. Her arms shook; she stumbled. She was too weak to lift it and stand on two feet.
“Ulkel. She’s a kid.”
“So? If she can’t do it, she knows what we’re doing. And she won’t tell. Right?”
The Gnoll looked at Mrsha. She met his eyes and then she looked at Calruz. Hate. Hate, hate, hate—she bared her teeth and shook her head. The Gnoll nodded.
“Anyone got a dagger?”
At that, Calruz stirred. He broke off from staring at Mrsha. He looked up. And his voice was low. It was familiar.
“Keep the child out of this. She does not need to see my face ag—”
He grunted and his head snapped back as the butt of the spear struck him. The Drake lowered it and spat.
“Shut up. Tkrn, take the kid out of here. And shut the damned door you idiot!”
“Come on, Mrsha.”
Tkrn muttered as he bent down and grabbed Mrsha. She didn’t protest as he pulled her out. But neither did she take her eyes off the far end of the prison. The Drakes and Gnolls were taking turns striking with the spears. And Mrsha wanted to see it. She trembled. She hated the Minotaur in the cell.
The last thing she heard was the Gnoll pulling a potion from his belt. He was talking to the Drake.
“Make sure to splash the healing potion on him afterwards. And mark me, Minotaur, you’re going to earn every drop.”
Then the door closed. Mrsha felt two paws put her on the ground. Tkrn waved a paw in her face. She looked up at last. And he stared down at her. His eyes were bigger. Worried.
“Mrsha. About that. It was—we’re just—it’s Captain Zevara.”
She didn’t respond. Tkrn went on, clearing his throat.
“She’s a good Watch Captain. One of the best. But she doesn’t understand. She’s not one of us. Don’t tell her. Don’t tell Krshia. Or anyone else. This is—justice.”
He hunched over his spear. And she smelled his fury too. Tkrn held her gaze. Mrsha nodded slowly. He relaxed.
“We’ll make him pay. For you and Honored Elirr and everyone else. Don’t tell. Now go, before someone comes looking.”
Mrsha went. Slowly. Gazing back at the prison. She kept remembering the sight. And part of her was afraid. Still afraid, even with the Minotaur in the cell. The rest of her wished she’d been strong enough to lift the spear, that Ulkel had given her a dagger. She shivered with hate.
That was how Raekea found her with Erin. They scolded her, worried, and Mrsha was whisked back to the inn in disgrace. She didn’t care. She had seen a monster. And she had seen him being punished.
It still wasn’t enough. But it was a start.

This was still the tale of two rats tied up in Erin’s inn. They found themselves there, freed from the captivity of a place darker and smaller than any they had known. A place where they couldn’t breathe, where they were captive.
And even in the light, in the air, a captive they remained. Tethered by their tails. By hope, perhaps. For one might have gnawed off their tail and saved the other. But neither brother nor sister had the will. The daring. They hoped, and so they remained, wandering around on the floor, pulling one, then the other.
Captives of the child. And she stared at them. And all the fun was gone.
She had been scolded, and reprimanded. Brought back in disgrace. But that was not what consumed her heart. It was memory and agony. It was vengeance.
