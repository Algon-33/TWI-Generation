Ryoka fumbled for words. She remembered it all, hazily. Flashes of horror. But—she focused, trying to assemble a picture of them.
“They were—there were this many…I think one was—one—”
There had been ███ of them. But every time Ryoka tried to fix on the number—it slipped away. Something was wrong. She tried to count.
“O—on—there was at least one…”
“Miss Griffin. Miss Griffin, don’t force yourself.”
The [Receptionist] sighed, but kindly. Ryoka felt at her head.
“What’s…?”
“Amnesia spells. Or some kind of other identity Skill or artifact. Few can remember anything, Miss Ryoka. It’s how they keep evading capture.”
The woman shook her head. Ryoka put her head on the counter, despairing.
No. Not even this? She distinctly recalled. She had known something about one.
“Saw…her…before. I think. Not me?”
Someone saw her. The [Receptionist] was calling for someone to help find a place for Ryoka to lie down. But the City Runner gritted her teeth, forced back her shock.
Not again. She was so—helpless! This was like Riverfarm. Even the smell of burned flesh was the same.
Like Belavierr. But those little—shits—weren’t even like her. No. No.
Remember. Damn you, remember! You overcame a geas. Remember. Or you really are worthless.
Ryoka struggled against something in her head. She tried to hold onto one thing.
One…
Thing.
They had been—
One of them had been flying.
Two of them had been flying. Ryoka began to smack her forehead on the table. The [Receptionist] tried to make her stop. But Ryoka felt it. The wind was whispering. She had seen the fae. She could remember—
One of them had been flying with █████.
Ryoka bit her tongue. One of them had been flying with—
“One of them had been flying with…say it to me.”
She pleaded with the [Receptionist]. The woman repeated the words, hesitantly.
“Er. One of them had been flying with…?”
Yes! Ryoka’s eyes went wide. She focused on that one detail as something ate the rest of her memories. But she fought the Skill or spell for this tidbit.
One of them had been flying with █i█g█.
One of them had been flying with █ings.
One of them had been flying with rings? No, you idiot.
One of them had been flying with wings.
Ryoka’s eyes snapped open. She grabbed the [Receptionist], who was whispering with her colleague about head injuries.
“One…was flying. Without a carpet. They had wings. That means they were a…a…a…”
She shook the woman, trying to make the connection. The woman gave her a blank look.
“A Drake?”
It fit. Ryoka sagged in relief.
“Yes! One of them was a Drake!”
She felt triumphant. For half a moment. Then she sagged. She knew it was true. But that was the stupidest…one of them was a Drake? Great. That narrowed it down.
But the [Receptionist] looked impressed. She hurried off after asking Ryoka to wait and came back with something. She read through it—fast. Then looked up.
“That’s…not on our list. There are few of them that have ever been identified in any way. Species, skin color—Gold-ranks who survived encounters with them have identified six members as Human. But Drakes? Are you sure?”
“Yes. And that means it was an Oldblood Drake.”
The [Receptionist] inhaled.
“The Drake Cities have continually denied the possibility that this could have ever been anything other than a Human group of [Raiders]. And you’re sure, Miss Griffin?”
“Positive. I saw a Drake.”
It was more true the more Ryoka said it. She had pierced the veil—but the rest had slipped away.
Perhaps it was meaningless. But the [Receptionist] seemed to think it mattered.
