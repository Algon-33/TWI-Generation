Home was Chandrar, where String People had been created. Dewlana shrugged.
“A fair amount. But I get a number of non-Cloth folk.”
“Really? For what?”
This was a Stitch-Shop, for repairing and maintaining and yes, upgrading bodies. Dewlana’s eyes twinkled.
“Actual massages. We repair your clothes at the same time. We are better at it than most.”
Revi laughed. That was Stitch-People for you. She felt Dewlana moving around her, spooling more silk out to do the more obvious stitches around her waist, shoulders, etc.
“No concealing threads?”
“What am I? A fleshie?”
Revi regretted the comment; Dewlana’s threads were nearly invisible. The [Seamstress] passed it off, though.
“Keep it noticeable. I understand.”
“Right. Sorry.”
Dewlana got back to work. Revi paused.
“So…home, huh? Are you from…?”
“Nerrhavia. Yourself?”
“Doran.”
“Oh, wasn’t that—?”
“Yep.”
“My condolences.”
“Eh, you know how it goes. It’ll be back or it won’t. But I don’t miss it too much. Frankly—the only thing I think about sometimes are…Alterkinds.”
The fingers paused in tying a knot.
“You don’t see many, indeed.”
“Yeah. Well, I was in Liscor and I can’t say they’d take kindly to seeing a…Cloth-Drake walking about. But I miss the creativity. No judgment.”
That was important. Revi opened the door and Dewlana walked through. She casually kicked the door shut to prevent spying on their conversation.
“Of course. You know, I knew someone. A friend. He experimented with—wings.”
“Really? Did they…?”
“No. You know how it is. The flesh moves, but he was too heavy.”
“You ever experiment?”
Another pause. Revi felt herself being unlaced at the waist. She was at her most vulnerable in this moment. Anyone could attack her when she was helpless. And yes, it was a concern. But not in this shop, in Invrisil. Any Stitch-Person who preyed on another in this scenario?
They’d be burned, piece by piece.
“…Well, you know.”
“Mhm. What did you try? I did—scales. You know, decoration. And a bit of protection.”
“Really? What kind of cloth…”
“You have to have really hard fabrics. But they have it.”
“Ah. Well—I—this is embarrassing.”
“Spill it. We’re both Cotton.”
Revi twisted her head. And she caught Dewlana mid-nod. The [Seamstress] froze. And then she exhaled. She paused, stepped back, and gave Revi a rueful look.
“What gave me away?”
“Aside from the fact that you employ Cotton-castes? And you’re sewing me up without so much as a sniff? I’m from home. I can see a cloth-craft.”
The [Summoner] nodded at Dewlana’s face. The [Seamstress]’ face looked like the rest of her body. Until you gazed closer and could see the micro-stitching holding the silk onto the original cotton. Dewlana sighed.
“You have no idea how hard it is to reduce your face’s cloth enough to layer silk over it. How obvious am I? No one’s ever commented…”
“Please. I told you, I hung out with Alterkind. They know all the tricks. Did it…”
“Hurt? I can’t remove my head. So it was flesh.”
Revi paused. That meant Dewlana had peeled her skin…she looked at Dewlana a second time.
“Was it worth it?”
“To run a shop as a [Seamstress] and not be stared down by other Silks? Absolutely.”
The woman’s eyes flashed. Revi nodded slowly. [Seamstress] was a prestigious class in Stitch-People society.
“Lips sealed. Don’t sew ‘em up.”
Dewlana relaxed. They were, after all, Cottons, and you had to stick together, even if one was passing for Silk. She spoke after a few minutes of quiet rethreading.
“…Ears.”
“What?”
“I had…er…you know Beastkin?”
“Yup. What about them?”
“I…altered my ears. Well, I added ears from other species. Bunny, dog—”
“Cat?”
