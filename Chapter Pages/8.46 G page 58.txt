….Hah. Well, I won’t divide this one up, but I will commit to a shorter chapter or my name isn’t pirateaba! Um. Anyways. I hope you liked it and I did get to the ‘end’ of my outline, for better or worse. Thanks for reading. I don’t have much to say right now, but I will be doing an edited chapter this month! It might even be the one right after my break!
I’ll speak on it next chapter, if it has words left. See you next time!
 
PS: I know we have a lot of fun here, but don’t eat rabbits. I like them.
