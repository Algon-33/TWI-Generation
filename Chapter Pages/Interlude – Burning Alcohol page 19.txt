Interlude – Burning Alcohol
Page 19
“Interesting. Well, if you want we can look around, but the Workers are busy and I don’t want to disturb them. Please don’t make them riot or anything. We can go have a drink somewhere if you want, catch up. Wishdrink’s? They’ll let us in and it’s a nice place. You can ask for a private room.”
Erin mock-glared.
“Hey! I don’t always do that. Sure. This helmet is making my head sweat. Tell me about what being rich is like!”
“And you can tell me about your fire. And why Mrsha keeps losing her ball every time she comes to play. Does she hate it? I can get her a new one if she doesn’t like it…”
The two were walking back through the city under construction when they heard a shout. The stream of people moving back and forth faltered. Selys looked ahead and Erin saw a group of [Guards]. Selys wavered.
“Oh. It’s him. Erin—”
She looked at Erin. The young woman stared back.
“Who?”
“I forgot. You really didn’t hear when you were on vacation—look, stay calm—”
And then Erin saw him. A tall, brown-furred form. A bowed head. A pair of horns. She froze.
The one-armed Minotaur was walking slowly. And he was being followed. A group of people were following the pocket of [Guards]. Some were shouting. Others hurling insults. The [Guards] snapped. Erin heard one shouting.
“No stones! That is a fine! Make way! Watch Captain’s orders! Miss, I will arrest you if you throw that!”
“What—”
Erin stared. She wasn’t ready. She hadn’t prepared for him. She hadn’t expected it. But he was there. Selys looked at her.
“You didn’t know? He’s been doing this the last three weeks. Well—normally they take him out at night. There was a near riot the first time. No one said anything?”
“No. I was in Pallass with the Wyverns. And then—they let him out?”
“For certain tasks.”
The young women listened. The [Lieutenant] was snapping at a furious Gnoll woman pointing at the Minotaur. She was shouting.
“Why hasn’t he been executed? Why is that thing allowed to walk around?”
“Watch Captain’s orders, Ma’am—until the prisoner is found definitively guilty—”
“I like your Watch Captain! But she’s mad in this! Mad! He killed Gnolls! Doesn’t that matter? Why are you protecting him?”
The Drake [Lieutenant] flushed. And—Erin saw with a start, it was only Drakes on the guard detail. And a pair of Humans. New recruits?
“Doing my job, Miss. And this is not a relaxing job. This is punishment detail. Culling a nest of Shield Spiders. Hauling stones—he’s under guard, Miss. But he’ll be clearing Hollowstone Deceivers. He volunteered for it, too. Jumps into nests of spiders alone. No weapons. We don’t even use healing potions. He gets hurt; a [Healer] stitches him up. If he dies…”
“He’s not good enough for thread. Do you hear me? You monster? Look at me!”
The Minotaur’s head never moved. He walked forwards as the others hurled insults at his back. And Erin saw him. Scarred, thinner. Without the crazed crimson light in his eyes.
And without the pride, that fearless smile, and his team of adventurers. This was neither Minotaur. But it was him.
Calruz.
“We should go. Please don’t start anything, Erin.”
Selys looked worried. As if she thought Erin would fly into a rage like the crowd—mostly Gnolls—who were following Calruz. But Erin wasn’t angry. She…stared at him.
The Minotaur never looked right or left. He let them shout at him. Even seemed to welcome it. He didn’t flinch as a rock bounced off his shoulder.
“Who threw that? I will arrest you!”
The Drake roared. But the thrower was nowhere to be seen. Erin saw Calruz twitch as the rock hit him. Hard. But he kept walking.
“Erin…”
