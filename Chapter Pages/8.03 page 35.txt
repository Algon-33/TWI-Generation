Mrsha went flying. The Gnoll landed in the kitchen of The Wandering Inn and whirled around. What the—? Ulvama smiled at Mrsha. Then she spoke.
“Little children stay out.”
She slammed the door.

Numbtongue sat on the hill, barely registering anything.
The statues were gone. They had returned to their place on the hill. But there was nothing…left.
Just memory. They had been here. And they had gone.
Something had come. Something…and Reiss had nearly been destroyed. But he had saved her.
Numbtongue should have taken his hand from the start. But if he had?
They were gone.
And so was she. Despair was the Goblin’s world. Despair and grief and…he would sit here. If anything came, he would kill it.
He had let Mrsha come and go. He had eaten when Palt made him move. Beyond that? He had no desire for anything. His ghosts were silent. Possibly Pyrite thought there was nothing to be said. Shorthilt…Shorthilt mourned.
And Reiss was just fragments. Numbtongue didn’t know what to do. Badarrow had gone, and Snapjaw before him. His brother had been just as broken.
All was lost. Numbtongue bowed his head. He only raised it when he saw the figure coming up the hill. He recognized Ulvama—ignored her.
Then blinked. Even in his full depression and mourning, the Hobgoblin noticed a distinct lack of clothing.
“You.”
Ulvama grinned at him. She had removed her top. Numbtongue stared at her. He…recognized her. No—
The [Shaman] seductively walked closer. She bent down.
“Sad Goblin. You need to eat. Listen to me. I am a [Shaman]. Why don’t you—”
She was reaching out to touch his shoulder with a simmering spell in her claw when the [Goblin Soulbard] caught her wrist. His eyes flickered.
“Ulvama. Enough. Leave him alone.”
The [Shaman] recoiled. The broken Goblin’s face had changed! His voice, too! He spoke shortly. Her memory tingled—but then she collected herself. She tried to touch his hand—he let go.
“Grumpy Goblin. You remember me. Don’t want to talk to female Hobgoblin after all this time? What about big, strong, male Goblin? Better? I can be both.”
She poked him gently. That would normally get a rise out of a Goblin either way. This one just grunted. He scratched his belly.
“[Shaman] magic is not what Numbtongue wants. Sex is not useful. Go away.”
She frowned. Was he speaking in third-person? The Hobgoblin picked up something. Grass from the hilltop. He put it into his mouth and began to chew.
“Hm. Bitter.”
He sounded so—familiar. She knew the mannerisms, way of speaking. And he seemed to know her.
“Have we met?”
She demanded. Why was he suddenly so talkative? The Hob glanced at her.
“Little [Shaman] of the Mountain City tribe. Used to get in trouble for stealing chief [Shaman]’s paints when we were small. Helped me when I didn’t poo for two weeks after eating rocks.”
She stared. Only one Goblin came to mind. But that was impossible. She had seen him die.
“Pyrite?”
“Mm. Thirty seconds. Leave Numbtongue alone. He will cut you. Unstable. Unhappy. Doesn’t need Ulvama-treatment.”
The Hobgoblin chewed. Ulvama’s mind raced. She knew Pyrite, before he had left Tremborag’s mountain. If he was here—she gasped.
“He knows the old secrets! He—Numbtongue—is a [Ghost Shaman]!?”
She looked at the Hobgoblin’s possessed body with awe and fear. He had become a medium for the Goblins of old? Pyrite shook his head briefly.
“No. [Goblin Soulbard].”
“Oh.”
Ulvama hesitated. She didn’t know that one. But she knew it existed. She peered at Pyrite.
“He has your ghost.”
“For ten seconds. Nine, eight…”
“Wait! Does he have ghost of Garen Redfang? Tremborag? Goblin Lord?”
