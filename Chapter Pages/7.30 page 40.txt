Bethal doubled over and then looked at Thomast as crossbows were lowered and everyone relaxed. Lyonette looked appalled. Ser Kerrig and the other [Knights] looked extremely wary. Thomast just blinked. Bethal looked at Erin and then at Thomast.
“I like you! I say, do you have anything to wash a dress with?”
Erin looked at Bethal. She glanced at Maviola. Then she fell down as Maviola kicked her legs in.

The [Lady] was in a good mood. After a quick change from her saddlebags, she sat in The Wandering Inn. And all was forgiven.
Between her and Erin, at least. The [Knights] were not happy. But the crossbows hadn’t even been loaded, a fact Thomast had pointed out. Now, they stood around in the inn.
And Bethal Walchaís had met the legendary [Innkeeper] with the magic door. She clapped her hands with delight as Mrsha offered her a towel.
“What a wonderful Gnoll-child! Hello! What’s your name?”
“She’s Mrsha. She can’t talk. Say hi to the nice [Lady], Mrsha.”
Mrsha signaled ‘hi, nice to meet you.’ Bethal’s eyes widened at the sign language.
“Hello? Was that hello? How terrible! Was it an accident?”
“No, Mrsha was always like this. She said—‘hi, nice to meet you.’ See—she makes words with her hands.”
“Ingenious. Thomast—look!”
“I see her, Bethal. Hello, Miss Mrsha.”
The [Chevalier] bowed slightly. Mrsha sniffed at him. The man looked around.
“We came through the door! During the game of soccer. But I had no idea you owned it. Maviola, you’re staying here?”
“Not here.”
Maviola was glowering at Erin. The two had kept kicking each other until Lyonette had separated them. Erin shook a fist around Mrsha. Maviola was crazy! Nothing like her. Who threw poo? Well, Bird. But he didn’t count.
“Amazing. And this is actually the origin of the Players of Celum?”
“Yup. We actually have another theatre group. See?”
Erin pointed down the [Grand Theatre]. The Players of Liscor were rehearsing A Doll’s House, completely inoculated to the madness of the inn. Lady Bethal looked around, eyes shining.
“What a splendid inn. An inn at a crossroads, thanks to the magical door! And we’re actually at Liscor? That’s hundreds of miles!”
“Well, it is a magic door. It’s nothing special.”
Erin puffed out her chest, slightly proud of the [Lady]’s wonder. Maviola whispered in Erin’s ear.
“So a magical door that teleports you four hundred miles is nothing special, but Potions of Youth don’t exist, hm?”
The [Innkeeper] scowled at Maviola’s good point. She saw Bethal Walchaís staring around.
“Sorry. For the crossbows. They were unloaded. I just wanted to scare you. I thought you were gonna beat Maviola up.”
“I probably would have settled for tossing a bunch of excrement over her.”
Bethal muttered. Thomast sighed. He bowed to Erin.
“My name is Thomast Veniral. Lady Bethal’s husband. I apologize for the misunderstanding, Miss Solstice.”
“Oh! That’s alright. I’m uh, sorry for kicking and punching that guy.”
Erin pointed at Ser Kerrig. The [Knight] was staring at Numbtongue. He jumped, distracted.
“What? Ah, no damage done, Miss Solstice. Indeed not. Lady Walchaís…”
“I see it, Kerrig. Hm.”
Bethal’s eyes locked on Numbtongue. She glanced at Erin.
“I understand Magnolia came here and made quite a fuss. She warned me to stay away from this inn. Something to do with unpleasantness?”
“Oh. Yeah. She’s banned. And so are her jerk friends.”
Erin folded her arms, scowling darkly. Bethal hesitated.
“…Would that include me? I count myself as Magnolia’s great friend. But I don’t bear you any ill-will, Miss Solstice.”
