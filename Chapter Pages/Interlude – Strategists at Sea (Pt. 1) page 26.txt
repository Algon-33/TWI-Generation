Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)
Page 26
A voice from behind Wil. He saw Yerranola, armed with a glowing hatchet. Her blade was enchanted with fire and she hacked into the slug attacking the [Sailor], raising steam as she did.
“Get it off him!”
Feshi was behind Yerra. She had a shortbow and loosed an arrow into a slug. But it did nothing.
Venaz on the other hand—he saw the [Sailor], and punched through the slug’s body. He began ripping out the organs. Yerra copied him. Her thin arms bulged and she and Venaz hurled the slug off the [Sailor].
The man was alive. But his shoulder was a mass of blood and slime. Wil looked about.
“Fuck all of this! They’re hard to kill!”
Peki was punching and kicking slugs as Merrik smashed slugs with his hammer. The Garuda whirled.
“[Launch Kick].”
She hit a rearing slug. The entire frame of the monster flew over the railing. Merrik grinned.
“That’s the way! [Ram’s Charge]!”
He smashed into another slug with his shoulder, blasting it into the railing. Peki jump-kicked it off the railing. But more kept coming up.
“He’s hurt. How bad?”
Feshi was leaning over the injured [Sailor]. The man was gasping.
“Can’t feel a thing. I don’t feel—it bit me?”
He was staring at them, in shock. The [Strategists] turned as a voice roared from the prow.
“All hands, repel these monsters! [Ship Spell: Floor of Impalement]!”
Captain Lasc pointed. A section of the deck erupted as huge, six-foot high spikes shot out of the wood. They impaled the slugs fighting the sailors there. The [Captain] whirled. His enchanted shortsword speared a slug through the stomach. His gauntleted fist flashed, tearing into the body.
“[Rallying Position]! [Attack Formation]! Don’t let them surround you! Surround them! Spells first, you idiots! Spells!”
Delivan was standing in front of the cabin. He’d replaced his crossbow for a wand and the [Sailors] were forming up around him. [Storm Sailors], like Inky were dueling the slugs while the lower-level ones pushed back in numbers, hacking the slugs apart.
But there were a lot of them. Wil looked around. Focus. He saw Feshi shouting, trying to pull the man belowdecks. Yes—but she’d lost focus of the battle. They were [Strategists]! Wil tried to find a way towards Delivan and Lasc. They needed his Skills!
“Yerra, help me get towards Lasc!”
Wil pointed. The Selphid turned. She was looking around as Venaz finished off the slugs he’d bisected. Even in pieces, they kept moving until he hacked them up even further. Yerra looked at Wil and shook her head.
“No! Get below!”
“What?”
“Get belowdecks! Help Feshi! We’ll send the wounded your way! Block the doors!”
The Selphid pointed. Wil shouted back.
“What about you!? We’re [Strategists]—”
A hand grabbed Wil’s shoulder. Merrik shouted.
“We’re [Commanders]! She’s a Selphid! Get below before we kick you down there! Use your Skills from afar—Venaz!”
The Minotaur wasn’t listening. As Merrik and Yerra forced Wil and Feshi towards the belowdecks, the Minotaur raised his axe.
“With me! Form up! You, you, you! Now!”
He pointed to Inky, Merrik, and Peki as well as a dozen [Storm Sailors]. They looked at him and fell in. Venaz roared as they charged the largest group of slugs.
“[Unstoppable Advance]! [Enhanced Strength]!”
“[Battalion of Glory]!”
“[Fleetwind Feet].”
Merrik and Peki added their Skills to the mix. Wil saw the group’s weapons glowing, and accelerate—they hit the first slugs and the monsters exploded. Venaz and his team began hacking through the starboard side of the ship as Lasc saw and put his men to the port side.
“Wil! Below!”
“But—fine! [Unit: Ram’s Charge]! [Unit: Lucky Dodge]!”
