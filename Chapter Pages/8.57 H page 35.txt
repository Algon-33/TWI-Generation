The slavers wavered. Gold-rank adventurer! Merr was laughing.
“Get them! Get—Pisces! Watch out!”
She slashed, but the riders charging forwards refused to get anywhere near her. Pisces looked up and saw the leader of this band coming straight at him.
The [Slave Master]. No—multiple [Slave Leaders]. He aimed up—
[Deathbolt]. One fell, white-faced, from her saddle. Pisces used [Flash Step], trying to evade. He leapt sideways and the horses began to turn, but were far wide of him. He saw the [Slave Master], the deadliest, probably highest-levelled of them, slash, but that was just a feint.
The whip! Pisces ducked and the tip cracked, missing his cheek with the paralyzing tip. He whirled.
Die—
His finger came up. The [Slave Master]’s hand tightened.
“[Recapture the Runaway].”
Pisces’ felt something lock around his neck. A metal—he choked, and was dragged off his feet as the horse and rider, now tethered to him by a gleaming rope, began to drag him across the ground.
 
——
 
“Pisces!”
[Slave Taker]. A class devoted to recapturing [Slaves]! The rider was dragging Pisces around on the ground and he was slashing at the rope attached to the collar to no avail. And just like that—it turned around.
Rophir heard Eloque scream. The morale of Merr’s bandits faltered in an instant, and the [Guards] pressed in. Pisces wasn’t out, nor were his undead—but he was fighting with the [Slave Master] and they were on the back foot.
“They’re losing.”
Qshom whispered. Rophir waited.
He knew what was coming next. They would all be taken captive. Given to someone like Riqre—but not before things were done to make sure they would never try to escape again.
“We have to help him! Someone—Merr!”
She was trying, but the [Slaver Leaders] were keeping far away from her. Someone had to help Pisces.
Rophir knew it. Someone else, to turn the battle around. It was…
It was what Riqre always said. Quality over quantity. The half-Elf boy waited.
Now. Now they would wonder how, these powerless [Slaves] without a class. Then…
He felt someone shift behind him. That big oaf. That…kindly man. Rophir waited.
“Rophir.”
Bearig looked down at him, a grave look on his face. Rophir waited.
I know. I know it has to be done.
So ask.
The half-Elf boy waited. [Assassin]. Young. But he had a class and levels…
Somewhere, Emir Riqre was laughing. He touched the dagger at his side. He felt Bearig lift him up—then he handed him to Qshom.
“Qshom, hold onto Rophir. Ride away if it looks south.”
Rophir stared at Bearig. Eloque turned. She had the spear in her claws, and twice now she had hesitated, almost looking as if she would ride into that fighting.
“Bearig?”
He watched as Pisces finally forced the [Slave Master] to let go of the rope. Staggering, Pisces whirled, slashing, but his magic was locked down. Not his Skills.
Bearig had a meat cleaver. A [Cook]’s tool that was also a deadly weapon. He drew it now. Stared at it.
“I’m no fighter. I may get in the way. But I have been thinking.”
He stared down at the battle. His lips moved. He only spoke and hesitated a moment. Less than a minute in total for all of it to take place. When Bearig turned, his eyes were bright.
“…I beat a [Slave]. I rented slaves, for my restaurant. I would curse at them, beat them if they were too slow, if they made mistakes. I treated them like I wouldn’t treat a dog.”
The others looked at him. Bearig turned back.
