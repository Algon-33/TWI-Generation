Ivery’s magically bound rock reappeared in the Skeleton Lord’s hand. He stabbed the man through the chest, then whirled and threw it like a baseball pitcher through part of someone’s skull.
Two figures. Merr was fighting amidst the [Bandits], using her Skills.
“[Hammering Blows]! Get that bastard! Stop them from getting those slaves into the city!”
She was matching the [Slave Master]’s Skills and fighting at the front. The [Bandits] were ready to break and run, but Merr kept them in the battle. Even so, with all of it, they would have run. They would have been overwhelmed, Ivery’s magic rock and Bearbones or not, if not for him.
Pisces whirled, running a [Guard] through. He aimed a finger, shot a [Deathbolt] through someone’s chest, and sprayed flames around him. Just a Tier 2 spell, but it kept them back. He [Flash Stepped] to the side, evading a swinging man with a club, and an arrow curved as it shot at him.
“Alive! Keep him alive!”
The [Slave Master] was screaming, but the [Guards] were desperate. Pisces aimed another finger and they scattered.
“[Deathbolt].”
Where he pointed, they died. Pisces’ rapier took someone else, slashing across their leg, then when they struck wildly, across their eyes. His mouth was open. He was laboring for breath, but he never stopped moving.
He was shouting. Fighting wilder and with more savagery than he ever had before. Die. Die! He aimed a finger up and an [Arrow of Light]—a regular one—hit an [Archer] in the groin.
Low shot. Pisces sprayed the archers on the walls with the spell, wishing he had Ceria’s aim. Wishing he had her spells. He retreated, put his hand up.
[Bone Wall]! It blocked off the bandits on one side, letting Merr focus forwards. Pisces closed his eyes.
“Arise! Rise and fight for me, bodies of the worthless in life!”
They rose. [Guards] cried out as zombies rose, from [Bandits] and [Slavers] alike. They fell, clawing, adding to the numbers of the fighters. Pisces gulped for air.
In his very soul, something was emptying itself. He felt it.
[Ashen Mana Well]. He drew on it until it was expended. Rise! Rise, and fight for a just cause! This battle will never end. For all those that die, I will call them back!
“I am the [Necromancer] of the Horns of Hammerad! Flee or die!”
Pisces shouted. He saw Ivery racing past him and drank from a mana potion, the last of three he had. The [Slavers] hesitated. Pisces lifted his finger.
I shouldn’t have let Mrsha have that wand. He focused a second—a [Bandit] fell, screaming, as the [Slave Master] slashed across her neck. An arrow nearly struck Merr and hit someone in the arm. The [Slaves] were fighting, but they were being dragged into the city—
It rested on him. Pisces gathered the mana and shouted.
“[Acid Orb]!”
“Scatter—”
A squad of [Slavers] saw the orb coming. Too fast—too close. The backwash actually spattered Pisces’ cheek and burned. Not as deadly as Erin’s acid but—they ran, screaming. Pisces drank another potion.
“[Deathbolt]. [Deathbolt]!”
He shot two [Guards] dead. Something was happening.
My [Ashen Mana Well] is recharging! He realized it was filling up with every death, with the undead around him. But only with death magic. [Deathbolt] worked. Undead worked. But—
The mana from the potion filled his veins again and burned. He was pushing himself—but Pisces aimed a finger up. A trail of fire followed it as his focus wavered. It didn’t matter. It was still magic in a box. Push and—
“[Fireball].”
The [Archers] vanished. Spells he had never had to employ—Pisces used them one after another.
