Interlude – The Gecko of Illusions

It was a miracle, really. A small miracle. Perhaps Pawn had been part of it. If so—he wasn’t telling. The poison had been purged from Relc and now he was healed.
But he would have scars. Bearclaw had left her marks. The poisonous bite of her claws had been reduced by the [Healer]’s ministrations and potions, but they were still there.
Raking marks on his face. Shoulders—well, at least the shoulders looked cool. But his face—the crossbow bolt had left another scar. Scales were missing, the raw flesh healed, but the scars lingered.
“Hey. It’s not like I can get uglier, right? Women love scars.”
The Drake muttered to himself. He laughed. It sounded like a sob. He didn’t look in a mirror.
He just sat there. He’d walked out of the clinic himself. He didn’t want to stay there.
Alone, Relc sat in his room. His coin pouch was empty. And he was tired.
No one knocked on the door. The city was in uproar. But no one was coming. The Drake sat there. And so he was quite surprised when he heard the knock.
“Hello? Are you in there? Can I come in?”
Relc looked up. The voice wasn’t familiar to him at first. He shrugged.
“Come in.”
Slowly, the door opened. And Ryoka Griffin entered the apartment. She saw Relc, sitting on the floor.
Around him were his puzzles. Magical puzzles, thrown around the room. His room was a mess. So was the Drake. Scars ran across his healed face. And his expression—
Ryoka Griffin looked down. A little magical puzzle was lying on the ground. Two bits of enchanted wire. You were supposed to tease them apart over months of work.
The Drake had torn the puzzle into two pieces. Slowly, Ryoka Griffin hesitated in the doorway.
“I…sorry.”
“For what? Come in. Shut the door.”
Ryoka did. The Drake didn’t move. Relc glanced around at the messy room.
“Sorry, I wasn’t expecting company.”
“I—no one?”
The young woman saw the Drake smile.
“My buddy’s gone. I didn’t think you’d come here…Ryoka? Right?”
“Yeah. Uh—no one?”
“Let’s see. It’s not rent day. The Watch thinks I’m at the [Healer]’s. The kid’s probably out—and Erin—that’s it.”
The Drake counted on his claws. He got to four and gave up. Ryoka Griffin slowly sat. She didn’t know if she belonged here. But…
“Um. Well…they’re all concerned. Your daughter is overturning the entire city to look for that Gnoll. Erin’s doing the same—the others are holding her back. She’s got everyone in the inn looking out…they think you’re in the clinic.”
Relc felt at his healed flesh. He laughed, shortly.
“Why? I don’t need to be. Potions’re easy. Not the first time I got into a fight. Back in the army, they slap you and tell you to go dig latrines even if you were just speared in the gut.”
“Sounds tough.”
“Yeah.”
The two sat in silence. Ryoka wasn’t Erin. She couldn’t fill the silence. She saw the Drake just looking ahead, blankly.
“I gave the money back. As much as I had. If I get more from the Triangle, I’ll give it to people. Tell Erin that.”
“I will. You—gave it all away?”
Every coin. Relc stared ahead. It had been such a good day. Could you turn back time? He doubted it. If it was that easy, every [Mage] would be a [Chronomancer].
“I’m fine. You can go back and tell Erin that.”
“Sure. I mean…no.”
Ryoka cleared her throat. She saw Relc looking up at her. The Drake blinked, slowly.
“No? Why are you here?”
“I just…wanted to check up on you. Sit here awhile, if that’s okay.”
“Why? I’m fine. See? Look at this.”
Relc flexed one arm, listlessly. Ryoka looked at him.
“I know. But—I think it hasn’t been a fun day.”
She heard a snort. She went on, quietly.
