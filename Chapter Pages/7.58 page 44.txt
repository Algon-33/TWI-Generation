The [Assassin]’s legs kicked slowly, amid the rubble. The Vampire’s eyes glowed crimson. She drank—
It felt good. For both. The [Assassin] had stopped struggling. She was melting…fading…the Vampire felt something entering her. Something she had craved.
Delicious, so delicious. She was so hungry. The kicking slowed. Fierre drank. And drank. And then—the voice sounded for the third time over the hour.
 
[Assassin Level 3!]
[Skill – Bloodform Blades obtained!]
[Skill – Lesser Dexterity siphoned.]
 
Three. Since gaining her class. The Vampire adjusted her grip. And she realized—
The kicking had stopped. She bared her fangs—but there was no more blood. She looked down. A blank stare met hers.
Fierre dropped the body. She crawled away, in horror, for a second. Then she licked her lips.
“Oh. Oh.”
So that—
That was how it was.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Notes: We didn’t get to the end of the…run. Lots of stuff happened! Again, the conversation with Lyonette at the top of the chapter (remember that), was supposed to be in last chapter, which would have allowed…
Well, it’s fine. Maybe. We’ll see. Thank you for reading!
I watched the end of the Unus Annus channel yesterday. Which if you don’t know about, it’s too late. Some things end. It’s more valuable because it ends.
Memento Mori. I’ll see you next chapter. We’ll see how it goes. We’re either .5 chapters ahead, or .5 behind. But why don’t I think that’ll be too much of a problem in terms of chapter length? Maybe a short one after all?
See you then. Today’s art is Enuryn’s Sea Shepherd ship, brought to you from the tales of another Courier! And a great Ryoka and Mrsha by Pontastic and a Fierre by Chalyon! Give them a thumbs up! Wait–you can’t do that. Leave a comment!
