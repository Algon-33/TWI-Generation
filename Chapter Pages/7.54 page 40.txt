Author’s Note: One more chapter. I’m running low on gas. Or magicore. Or whatever I use. But that’s okay! I’ll get a refill soon enough.
Hope you enjoy. What do I have to say about this chapter? Well, the bicycle scene was one of those written long ago. And…and…
That’s about it. I’ll leave you with arts and we’ll see what the next chapter brings. I don’t have much more to say; I’m just sleepy and hungry. Everything I had went into the chapter. Thanks for reading!
Today’s art is by Enuryn who’s done Sage’s Grass, Shane Sandulak of The Last Tide, who did a Solca-abs sketch at the request of readers…and Cortz, who did and is still doing art for Inktober, pratically daily!
…Readers are too into abs.
