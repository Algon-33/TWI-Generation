The Worker pushed past them all. He fell to his knees.
“Pawn! Enough!”
Garry’s voice was the loudest thing on the hill. People turned. The [Priest] raised all four hands.
“I must try.”
He touched Erin. Bypassing the enchantments. Reaching out. Speaking.
“[Heal Minor Wounds]. [Heal Minor Wounds]! Heal her, I beg you!”
Saliss looked up. Pawn raised two arms as two more touched Erin gently around the frozen blood. Maviola El looked back. Lyonette inhaled—
Nothing happened. Pawn spoke again. Repeating the Skill.
Heal…? The Worker looked around. He produced a dagger and slashed himself. Green blood fell onto the grass. He spoke.
“[Heal Minor Wounds].”
The cut closed. Pawn stared at his arm—then touched Erin again.
“Why won’t it work?”
“Pawn. Enough. She is g—”
Garry saw Pawn whirl. The Worker charged Garry. The [Cook] was knocked off his feet. They went tumbling down the hill.
“Pawn!”
Lyonette cried out. Mrsha woke as she put the little Gnoll down and tried to separate the two. Garry didn’t even stop Pawn as the Worker flailed at him. The other Antinium tried to pull them apart—
“Enough!”
The word stopped the two Antinium. They looked up.
Viceria Strongheart. Maviola El closed her mouth, lowered her hand. The [Green Mage] looked down at Pawn.
“How dare you? Stop fighting. Go.”
The [Priest] looked up at her. Then he sagged. He lay there, strings cut, as the Soldiers and Workers helped him up. They carried him away.
“Healing?”
Maviola had not heard wrong. But no one could…but she had seen it.
Yet that was still overshadowed by this moment. She would not forget it. She hated that she could be so analytical, save that reflection for later.
“Let’s go into the inn.”
Lyonette went back. Mrsha was looking up at the hill. She’d been dreaming that this was all a dream. And Erin had hugged her and called her silly—
She wanted to go back up. Lyonette carried her down. The little Gnoll was too tired to fight. She just lay there, on the table where Lyonette placed her.
The common room of the inn was silent. People ate to distract themselves. Some of the staff were working—in silence.
Grief had a different place here. It could be louder. Maviola heard an argument. She saw a broken table. Wailant had smashed it.
She let Lyonette grab some food from the kitchen. Pizza. Maviola stared at it blankly until Lyonette put a slice on her plate. No one touched it. Not Saliss, not Maviola—
They were here. The children from Earth. The [Mages], sitting around. The Silver Swords, Fierre, the staff—some drifted over as Lyonette spoke.
And the full, sorry tale emerged.
A raiding party from Hectval, here to avenge an insult to their city’s honor. Overconfidence.
Poisoned bolts.
“Why the ice? To keep her from becoming undead? It won’t stop the process long. You need to—properly prepare her body. A coffin. Or cremate her.”
The [Princess] flinched. Mrsha looked up.
“No. Maviola—it was Kevin’s idea. She’s—she’s not dead.”
Maviola just looked at Lyonette.
“She is dead, Lyonette.”
“No. She’s not.”
Rose raised her voice. Some people looked around. The young woman looked at Maviola, pointing at Kevin.
“Kevin thought of it and he’s right. Erin’s in cryostasis! It’s this thing where you freeze someone and they’re not dead. They can be brought back to…”
Maviola listened. She shook her head.
“Insanity. You’re wrong, Miss Rose. You cannot bring back the dead. Not—perhaps in the era of legends, it might have been possible. When Dragons flew across the skies. Even then—it would have been a miracle. You would need the greatest of relics. Or—”
