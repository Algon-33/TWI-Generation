In their rolling brawl, Isceil finally got a leg under Ceria’s stomach. He kicked her off him and the half-Elf stumbled up. She looked for Isceil as the Drake muttered a word.
“[Dust Storm]—”
He vanished in a cloud of dust. Ceria cursed and raised [Ice Walls], shooting spikes wildly with her skeletal hand. She whirled, creating her own stationary barrier. The adventurers coughed, moving backwards. Ceria looked around—
“Captain! To your left!”
She turned too late. Isceil’s lightning shattered the ice wall. The half-Elf aimed her wand, and the Drake closed his maw. He pointed his and the [Delayed Fireball] flew.
This time the explosion engulfed the ice barrier. Ksmvr made a sound. Ceria was lying on the ground. The [Ice Armor] had caught most of the spell, but she was dazed. Isceil aimed his wand at her as she threw up a hand.
“Got y—”
The black bolt of magic hit Isceil from behind. It passed through him, bursting out of his chest. Isceil fell forwards. Yvlon stopped. Montressa’s eyes went wide as Ceria rolled to her feet.
“Isceil!”
Ksmvr’s head turned. Behind the Drake, Pisces lowered his finger.
“[Deathbolt].”
Isceil fell to one knee, face white. Ceria looked up and Pisces dodged a huge comet as Montressa screamed, firing spells with both her wand and the brass orb. Ceria looked up at Pisces. Isceil raised his wand as the [Necromancer] appeared, conjuring a barrier.
Pisces looked down at his ring. [Shatterbolt]. He hadn’t used it on Montressa. He couldn’t. But Isceil? The Drake looked up, stood, shakily.
“You coward.”
The [Necromancer] didn’t reply. He just set his stance, preparing to lunge. The Drake reached for a potion, wand at the ready.
“Pisces!”
Montressa screamed at Pisces, but her barriers kept her locked in place. She took a step, unsure, and saw Ceria advancing towards her. The [Ice Mage] met Montressa’s eyes. She smiled bitterly.
“Hey, Mons. Let’s settle this. Team captain to captain.”
Montressa looked at Ceria. The half-Elf looked at her. For a moment they remembered. Ceria’s voice was low.
“I should have said this all that time ago. He’s not perfect. And he never was. But he is my friend. If you want to hurt him, I’ll stop you.”
“You don’t understand what he is.”
Ceria shook her head. She looked at Montressa, with pity in her eyes. And she raised her wand.
“No. I don’t think you do. And you’ll kill him? You’ve gone mad. Come on, Montressa. Let’s settle our pasts.”
She lifted her wand. Palt kicked himself.
“Madness. She probably lost her grip when she saw the undead! We can [Calm] her. Ulinde! Ksmvr! Let me go to her! She’s not thinking!”
The Antinium looked at Palt. He hesitated.
“That is a very good try. I almost believe you. Don’t move.”

“Bevussa. I think I see movement ahead.”
“Where?”
The Garuda froze as Kin halted in the dungeon. The Drake [Mage] aimed her wand ahead.
“There.”
“Facestealer? Ready—”
Bevussa instantly warned her team. They clutched the magical amulets they’d bought. Zassil and Issa flew back, out of range. Bevussa hunkered down, ready to move. She waited—
And a masked, clothed figure appeared around a corner. Bevussa stared, and then she relaxed.
“Dead gods! You scared us!”
The masked warrior waved at Bevussa. The Garuda waved her forwards. She recognized the clothed body and the mask.
“We haven’t seen you in over a week. Where were you? Are you alright? We have to talk. Can you write? I’ve brought parchment and ink—”
She paused. The Garuda stared as the masked woman jogged forwards. Something was—off. Kin paused.
“Hey, does her mask look different to you, Captain?”
“Stop!”
