Alcohol. Lupp sighed as he eyed the gin. He’d asked Ryoka to bring him some. The [Farmer] took it all eagerly, then did a double-take at the gold mixed with the silver.
“Dead gods, but that [Lady] kept her word. Gold for corn. Who’d have thought it?”
“You say that every time. When are you going to stop?”
Ryoka teased Lupp gently. The [Farmer] just stared at the small fortune he’d been given. Then he closed the money pouch and looked around.
But his farm was isolated. And his beautiful fields of corn were growing again.
“I’ve made three harvests. Figured that Lady Walchaís would get bored of the corn.”
“She’s not eating it all. It’s going to a market.”
“Still. It’s worth all this? And she sends a wagon by each month, a proper fast one. As if my corn’s…well, it is some of the best you’d ever eat.”
The [Farmer] caught himself, straightening with pride. Ryoka grinned. She liked Lupp. The lonely farmer…she understood. Perhaps more than even Fierre, or Alber. They had parts of Ryoka’s passions.
But Lupp stood there, looking grateful just to talk to someone. He nodded awkwardly towards the bottles of gin.
“Fine stuff you brought. As good as the gold. Did my daughter say aught?”
“Just that you should stop sending her gold.”
“Hah. What else do I use it for? She can…thank you for running it to her. Here. A tip.”
Lupp fumbled for a gold coin. Ryoka put her hand out.
“It’s fine—”
“No. No. Take it. It’s too much otherwise. You do these regular deliveries when I know you have better paying work.”
Reluctantly, the young Asian woman took the money. Then she smiled.
“Thanks. People have been too kind to me.”
“Oh? And you’re the first person I’ve seen the last three days. What did you do today? Er—come in. Can I offer you some of the gin?”
“I wouldn’t want to prevail—”
The [Farmer] glanced up under his hat. He eyed Ryoka.
“Not at all. I’d take it kindly. But if you’re busy, don’t mind me, please.”
He had no artifice. Ryoka hesitated in the face of the naked choice. She ducked her head after a moment.
“…I’ll stay. Thanks.”
Alike indeed. That was how, as dusk fell, Ryoka Griffin found herself in Lupp’s farmhouse, sharing a meal. It was—corn. But delicious. You could eat it raw, boiled—and Lupp’s corn was the best.
Especially with some gin. The two drank as they ate. Ryoka related her day, Lupp speculated about a mega crow he’d seen leading the pack. That reminded Ryoka of Mavika.
“Watch out for crows. I met a [Witch] once—”
“That crow bitch?”
Lupp was already on his second shot. He slammed down a fist and Ryoka jumped.
“You know her?”
“Of course. Anyone living far from cities knows…and my corn is the best! She tried to make me an offer. No crows for a year for two harvests. I turned her down so her crows took a crap all over my house. Damn [Witches]. How d’you know her? Don’t tell me you got on her bad side. She’s a nasty one.”
“I actually met her in Riverfarm. It was this entire scene. I—it’s hard to explain.”
“Tell me. Unless you have to be anywhere tonight?”
Ryoka glanced out the window. Then she looked back at Lupp. The lonely [Farmer] was the best kind of audience. Hungry to know. She took a breath.
“…No. Okay. Listen. Do you know about…other [Witches]?”
 
—-
 
She told Lupp an abridged tale of the [Witches] at Riverfarm. The death of Ser Reim—the evil of Belavierr. A mother’s twisted love.
Lupp listened, exclaiming, asking questions. Falling silent and shuddering at the image of wildfire set by a Drake. Belavierr’s immortal, immoral bargains.
“All that happened while you were gone? You never said.”
