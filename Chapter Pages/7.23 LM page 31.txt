“Every other sentence. ‘Erin did this’, or ‘Erin showed me that’. Do you think she gave you your class?”
The [Strategist] stared over the side of the bridge they were standing on.
“Sometimes, yes. I’m not as original as her. Without her—how much of my accomplishments are mine? The magazine—anything else?”
He was crumpling, even in his genius. Maviola El looked at him. And she had seen this before. You could be so unkind.
“You—are all—I just don’t know what to do. Don’t go outside! Listen, you can’t talk about…home. Do you understand? There are monsters here. Rock Crabs. Shield Spiders—”
Erin was berating them. The others listened, flushing. And Imani, gulping, flinched. And then began to scream. Erin jumped as the others crowded around her.
“Imani! It’s alright!”
The young woman was in hysterics. Actual hysterics. She refused to calm down, even though the Rock Crabs were gone. She was crying, hitting the others as they tried to grab her.
Mrsha stared contemptuously. Her ears hurt. And she hated them. They’d nearly gotten killed by crabs?
Idiots! She furiously raced up and kicked Joseph in the leg.
“Ow. What the fuck?”
“Mrsha, stop that!”
Lyonette snapped. But no one was happy with the Earthers. And Mrsha—looked at Imani as the girl recoiled from her.
“I want to go home!”
She sobbed. Perhaps only Pisces and a few others knew what that meant; Grimalkin was busy talking with Pryde. Imani howled. And Mrsha couldn’t take it anymore. She bared her teeth. Ryoka had sent them? They didn’t deserve to be here!
Mrsha would take care of them. She’d—she’d make them pay for being so stupid. Sticks in their pillows. Throw rocks at them! She balled up her little paws into fists.
“Imani, stop screaming!”
Joseph shouted at Imani. But she wouldn’t. Erin clenched her teeth. Lyonette looked around, exasperated. She could shut Imani up with her aura. She looked at Rose.
“Why is she screaming? They’re gone.”
“I’m sorry. It’s—she was attacked by Crelers. Her group was—killed. She still has nightmares. Imani, shh. It’s okay. Where’s the calming tonic, Kevin?”
“We ran out—”
Lyonette blinked. So did Mrsha. She stopped, ready to slash an ankle with her thorn paw. And she looked up.
“Crelers? Oh. Her entire group was—”
Erin mouthed the word ‘eaten’ at Lyonette. The [Princess] paled. And the Horns of Hammerad slowly looked up.
Imani was still terrified. Crying. In hysterics, yes. Which grated on the ears. It was so easy to hate that. Unless you had seen it.
Lived it. Mrsha looked at Imani’s tears. And it had not been Crelers for her, but Goblins. Yet she knew what it was like to be afraid, even in a safe place. She thought how exasperated she, Erin, Lyonette—everyone was.
And the Gnoll child realized they were being unkind. She looked up at the frightened girl.
She was crying. Weeping, babbling about Crelers, as she clung to Kevin. This world’s nightmares. She had survived that.
Erin’s arms slowly uncrossed. She looked at Imani, and the other silent young people from Earth. And she saw it in every line of how they stood.
Fear. Uncertainty. Terror, still. They hadn’t known about the Rock Crabs. Hadn’t imagined they could have been in that much danger five minutes from the inn. Erin Solstice looked at them and remembered a young woman who had run screaming from a Rock Crab the first time she’d gone for a walk.
And then she saw a little white Gnoll looking up at her. And Erin Solstice felt her anger—fading.
