Magnolia Reinhart lay on the ground. Stunned. She was protected—but not prepared for combat. She tried to stand, reach for another artifact.
Mire walked over and struck her.
[Tremor Fist]. Down the [Lady] went again. Again—unharmed. But Mire dragged her up and threw her into the carriage.
It was easy. The ring had to run out of power sometime. The [Lady] kept trying to use her Skills. But this wasn’t a ballroom, or even a battlefield. The [Martial Artist] walked through her attempts to use her aura and struck her again. The ring’s glow flickered.

“Damn you! [Lesser Teleport]!”
The [Mage] screamed as Ressa leapt at him. Unlike Magnolia, the [Assassin]-[Maid] knew how to use her ring. She ignored his spells and went for the kill. He vanished and the [Trapmaster] looked up as Ressa advanced on them.
“Damn.”
“I have her. Thanks.”
The [Blademaster]’s arm was still green, but the poison had stopped. Now he lifted his enchanted sword.
“[Sword Art: Four Singing Stars]!”
Ressa took two cuts that sent her stumbling back. Ring or not—she was taking hits. And the artifacts were running out of magic.
But the servants were getting in the way. The two [Maids] had wounded the [Assassin] throwing his arsenal of weapons. Sacra had dealt him a crushing blow to one arm, nearly breaking his damn bones before he fought her back. The [Thrower Assassin] snarled. He drank a potion and was fine—
Until the [Butler] leapt on him.
Reynold was wounded. He’d broken something in the fall. But he had artifacts too. Now he leapt with a roar, his sword aimed for the [Assassin]’s back.
“[Leaping Strike]!”
“Aaaah!”
The man screamed as Reynold penetrated his back. But not far enough. The [Assassin] tore away and ran; Reynold hadn’t run him through. Both sides had defensive artifacts.
The [Combat Butler] cursed. He saw Lady Magnolia; the Minotauress was grabbing her neck and trying to twist it off, but her ring was still active.
“Lady Reinhart!”
He charged. Mire leapt away with an oath as Magnolia produced a glittering dagger and Reynold attacked her.
“Hey Sithorn, this isn’t going well! Those damn rings are bad enough, but the servants—”
“I see them.”
The [Trapmaster] watched as Ressa pushed back the [Blademaster] again, and the [Mage] at the same time. He looked at Mire. Their clients weren’t happy about this, he was sure. Still—this was the job.
“Let’s change the battlefield. Sacrifice my field. The carriage is upside down, anyways.”
“Got it. Back up.”
At Mire’s voice, the other [Assassins]…ran. They jumped, teleported, or just ran for the wire walls of the field, ducking through the openings only they could see. Magnolia Reinhart’s servants regrouped.
“Lady Reinhart! Teleport!”
“I’ve been trying! None of the scrolls are working!”
Magnolia stared at the [Mage] among the [Assassins]. Ressa whirled.
“Reynold, Sacra, get that coach upright. You two, cover me—”
She saw the other five assassins standing outside the net of wires. And two of them—Ressa saw old Sithorn, the [Trapmaster] she had known, standing with Mire. Her eyes widened.
“No. Get inside the c—”
They moved too slowly.

“[Combination Skill: The Web Closes].”
Mire stood next to Sithorn. The [Trapmaster] had given her the wires and a glove. It was a combination Skill. Something that took two experts working together to perform.
It was a simple Skill. The Minotauress grabbed the wires and pulled. They snapped through the air. Closing inwards in a single moment.
