Perhaps there is some masochistic part of me, some part that loves to torture myself. But this room is where I come to. Huge, wall-to-wall mirrors cover all but the doorway, reflecting my image a thousand times. I stare around.
“Alright. Here I am. Here you are. Come on. If you’re real…come out.”
I have to do this. I can’t live in uncertainty forever. The voice in my head—I keep telling myself it’s just me. Just me, trying to rationalize my insanity, what I went through.
But what if it’s not?
These are the dark thoughts I have at night, the suspicions I can’t push away without daylight. My fears.
I went insane. I went crazy and killed people. That much the others believe. That I know happened. And I’m sure it was me. Mostly sure. But, the thought whispers, what if it wasn’t me?
What if the [Lesser Insanity] condition isn’t some part of me, but something else? The madness—I can remember laughing as I stabbed the Demon lieutenant. I can remember the pain. Gods, the pain. But I also remember how I felt.
It wasn’t me.
But it was.
But it wasn’t. In the darkness, I feel certain. In that moment, when I held Wilen, I didn’t care. I reached out, and let something in. Something dark. Did I open the door somehow?
Did you? Or is it just you? Are you holding me back? Or am I just an excuse, Tom?
“Go away.”
I stare at the mirror ahead of me. There’s a feeling in my head, a bit of madness. I can feel it worming its way around. I know the mirror is just a reflection of me. It shows my clothing, stained, and my face, tired, my eyes a bit bloodshot. Me in perfect detail. I know that’s all it is.
But something tells me that’s not all. Something tells me there’s something else staring back behind the glass. What?
“Who are you?”
Who are you?
“I know you’re there. I can feel you. Hear you. My shadows move when I don’t look. My eyes—”
Normal eyes. But if I look away, do they keep staring? I try it. Turning my head and looking back quickly. But the mirror me reflects perfectly each time. I grit my teeth.
“Move, damn you. If you’re going to play tricks on me—”
I reach out and touch the glass. I stare into my reflection’s eyes, daring it to move, to twitch even a second. Tom stares back, pallid, sleep-deprived, wide-eyed. He grins at me.
I stop smiling. So does my reflection. Damn it, it’s all in my head.
All? Are you sure?
It has to be. I take my hand away, noting with guilt that I’ve smudged the mirror. I try to polish it, but just spread the oils from my palm around.
“I hate you. If you’re there, I’ll kill you. I swear it.”
You? You and what madness?
Laughter. The voice isn’t the worst. The voice sounds like me at times, a bit crazy, darker, but still what I’d think. The voice only scares me at times. But it’s when I feel like laughing, like punching the glass until my hand is full of shards that I’m afraid.
It would be so easy. So easy to push the glass deep. What would it feel like if it hit bone? I make a fist, staring at my stupid expression. My eyes.
“Well, I expected to be alone, but I suppose I was a fool for thinking that. More proof that I’m good at my job, then.”
A voice. I whirl, and see a short man in colorful clothing. The Fool. He walks into the room with a brisk step. He’s got a bottle in hand and a cup. He nods at me, not smiling, but not frowning, either.
“Mister [Clown]. I didn’t think to see you tonight.”
“Ah. You’re…”
He puts the bottle and cup in the ground and gives me a dramatic bow.
