“Will you? Wistram’s [Mages]? Do you have the courage to take up arms? This is a game. But it is your chance. The Professor challenged us to defeat a legend. Will you be part of that legend? Or will you live knowing, always knowing that you could have made history and you did not?”
They stared down at her. And the Gnoll raised her paws.
“I call upon heroes. I call upon champions! I call upon you. Daquin! What say you? Have you any lions that prowl through Baleros’ jungles? Would you be Nagas? Or would you be Drakes, hiding behind your walls?”
She grinned. And then the silence broke. There was laughter. The Lizardfolk sitting above laughed. Drakes? They laughed and the first Lizardfolk swung himself down, dropping two stories.
“I’m no Drake!”
A door opened. A serpentine figure slithered down the steps.
“And I am Naga.”
She slithered forwards. And at that, a score of Lizardpeople rushed out the doors. And then Dullahans. They marched out their doors. Dullahans, Centaurs. Humans.
“For history?”
A Dullahan [Baker] adjusted his head on his shoulders and grabbed a rolling pin. He looked around. Feshi grinned.
“For Daquin.”
And they came. In tens. Then hundreds. Then thousands. Children had to be restrained by parents. But the rest came, shouting. Laughing. Cheering the bold Gnoll who dared them. Because they were Lizardfolk, Dullahans, Centaurs, and yes, more species still. And some had cheered for the Iron Vanguard. Others had no strong interest in the students winning. But they were citizens of Daquin first. And she had offered them a chance for history, a chance to be part of history.
It was just a game, after all. Wasn’t it? Wil stared up. The Humans looked around, counting. One street. Then two. Feshi turned back towards him.
“We can hold them for half an hour. The rest is up to you. Be the lance and break them.”
Then she turned and bounded forwards. And the city erupted around her. Wil watched her go. Then he turned. Venaz was blinking. Marian shuffled her hooves.
“Wow. I didn’t know Feshi was that good.”
An arm squeezed Wil tight. Talia was flushed with excitement as she pointed to the map.
“This is it, Wil! We can do it! The Iron Vanguard will be stuck in the streets! If they beat down Daquin’s citizens, they’ll be called monsters!”
“Even if they try, there are ten of Daquin’s own for every one of them.”
Sir Kelm observed quietly. He was frowning, eying the soldiers around him. Wil nodded. Then he frowned.
“We have one problem, though.”
“Which is? You’ve just been given an army of tens of thousands! What could be wrong now?”
Venaz snorted. Wil glance up at him and shook his head.
“No one can stop Xol. Without lances, the [Knights] have as much chance of slowing him down as—we tried ropes and he pulled a dozen horses off their hooves. Could Centaurs do better, Marian?”
“Uh—”
Marian paled, which was as much an answer as any. Wil shook his head. He looked at his sister and Sir Kelm. If it came to that—
“Let me try.”
Someone spoke behind Wil. He turned. The City Runner was looking with interest at the map. He glanced up and around. The table stared at him blankly. The Minotaur and Centaur sharply. Luan smiled. His arm flashed gold as he held up a hand.
“I think I have an idea. I can stop Xol for a while. A few minutes, at least. Pay me and I’ll do it.”
Wil blinked at him. Talia sucked in her breath. It was a ludicrous notion. But in this moment, all things seemed possible. And—Wil glanced at Talia. She nodded.
“How much?”
Luan thought for a second.
“Ten gold pieces. And eighty silver pieces to pull it off. I work cheap.”
