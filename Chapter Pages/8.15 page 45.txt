She offered the [Witch] of trees a hamburger of memory, Imani-style since all the ghosts liked that. The [Witch] stared at her. Califor made a strangled sound in her throat.
After a second, fingers like twigs took the burger. Erin went around the circle, smiling and talking.
“Hi, I’m Erin. Have a hamburger. Hi, I’m Erin. Hamburger? Erin—burger? Um—spaghetti?”
She conjured the memory of a good spaghetti with alfredo sauce. Califor reached out and smacked it out of Erin’s hand. The plate hit the ground, shattered, and vanished.
One of the remaining [Witches] looked disappointed. Another, who sat in the center, did not. She raised one eyebrow and spoke.
“We did not come here to gorge ourselves on memory and regret, girl.”
Erin looked at her. Even the [Innkeeper]’s cheerful bravado wilted for a second.
An eye stared back. A vast eye, joined by smaller ones, opening and closing, shrouded by a single, vermillion witch’s hat. Each iris a different color.
That was all Erin could make out. There were…limbs…yes, but the [Witch] beneath the hat was shrouded by darkness. It wrapped around her, yet Erin saw the flash of sharp teeth as the mouth spoke.
“You are everything Witch Califor says. More and less. The courage to face down what we will not name. The arrogance to make nothing of your talents, to be satisfied with mediocrity.”
Erin Solstice stared at the [Witch]. The things Erin had learned were these:
Gods were petty, ghosts were chaotic, and [Witches] were rude.
“…But you’re dead. It’s just a burger. Don’t you want—?”
She was about to say that the [Witches] might never get a second chance to remember food or the joys of the living, but the [Witch] snapped back a reply.
“We are dead, with the infinity of the afterlife before us. Yet somehow, you still manage to waste time.”
Erin hesitated. Califor took her place, and the nine [Witches] looked at her.
“You must learn something, Erin Solstice. We believe your nature matches ours. Will you at least listen to what we have to teach you?”
The [Innkeeper] bit her lip. She fidgeted in front of the [Witches], glanced around.
“Me? But I don’t really fit in. Are you sure there are no legendary [Innkeepers] or, like, amazing [Bartenders] I can learn from? Really, that’s more fitting than…”
She trailed off in front of the stares of the [Witches].
“A fish dances on the line less desperately than you. What fear you, Erin Solstice? You have died. What is there left to fear?”
Another [Witch] commented, her voice bubbling, hat concealing half-aquatic features. Erin looked around.
“I’m just not um—[Witch] material! I like your hats! It’s just—”
“As stubborn as teaching Dragons manners. You said as much, Califor. I wonder why.”
Yet one more [Witch]. She crackled, sitting opposite the [Witch] of trees. She wasn’t exactly fire. More like the memory of it. Thus—charcoal skin. Ash, as if she were flaking apart as Erin looked at her. This ash-witch leaned forwards. She had one eye; the other was a socket.
“What do you fear? Not the power of it, I think. Yet something holds you back.”
In front of the nine stares, Erin Solstice hesitated. Why did she resist? She was dead. The world was in danger. She had always wanted the power to help her friends. Dreamed of it. Longed for it in those dark days. Why…?
The answer slipped out of her.
“What if I’m not special, though? What if I can’t live up to those expectations? I don’t think I’m capable of changing things. If you give me all this knowledge and put me in that place where everyone counts on me—what if I fail and they all suffer and die because of me?”
