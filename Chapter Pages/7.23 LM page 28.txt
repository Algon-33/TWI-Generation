“That’s like—being one of those people. That dresses up in costumes?”
“A furry?”
Troydel looked at her. Kevin frowned.
“Drassi’s not that. She’s a person.”
“But she’s a lizard—”
“Don’t call them that.”
“Guys! I’m just asking if we want to stay here.”
Rose raised her voice. The others looked at her. Joseph, rubbing his head, muttered.
“Why not? We don’t have anywhere else to go. But is it safe? Erin can’t protect us. She’s got that Gnoll—that red-haired girl, a few employees—”
“That cute Gnoll. Did you see her face?”
Galina sighed. The others were arguing. They were lost. And—under one misconception. Only one, really. They thought of Erin as being like them. Because they didn’t know her.
Or Liscor. If they had, they might have understood. Crucial facts about the inn, about Erin that made her—not like them. Little details, that was all the seven were missing.
Like the fact that rocks moved. One of them slowly stood up and crept over a hill. It had a lot of little legs.
Another Rock Crab slowly stood up. And then another. And another. They saw the food moving in a helpful group and began to creep closer. Most Gnoll [Hunters] kept their distance from the telltale rocks. But the Earthers, like other animals not used to the Floodplains, didn’t know.
And that wasn’t their fault. Rose was poking at the others.
“All I’m saying is, we owe Erin. Don’t be an idiot and steal her drinks, Joseph! We’re going to go back, help out, and—just be helpful! Got it? Any objections?”
No one had any. But it was Imani, a [Survivor], who had been clutching Rose’s shirt who quavered.
“Everyone? I just saw—a rock move.”
The others looked at her. Joseph glanced around. There were a few rocks. Boulders, really. Big. Kevin scratched his head.
“Like…roll down a hill?”
“No. It stood up. That one.”
Imani pointed. Now the Earthers glanced around. Leon frowned.
“Those are a lot of rocks. Were they here…when we started walking?”
They halted. Six rocks were spaced around the small hills about them. The Earthers paused. They weren’t idiots.
“I think…we should go back.”
Rose breathed slowly. She hunted for the magic wand she had been given. Joseph felt at his belt.
“I don’t have a sword. Anyone else?”
“I…left my wand back at the inn.”
The others looked at each other. They glanced back the way they came. There was a giant boulder in the way.
Imani whimpered.
“It stood up again.”
All seven heads turned. They saw a bunch of tiny legs as one of the rocks got up and shuffled towards them. They stared. Then Imani began to scream.
“Monsters! Run!”
Kevin bellowed. He pointed. The others ran for a gap—and as one, the Rocks Crab stood up and began scuttling at them. Giant pincers appeared under the rocks as the Rock Crabs lifted up their disguises.
And they began to click.
Clickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclick—
“Run! [Fire Arrow]!”
Rose pointed. An arrow made of fire blasted off a shell as she missed the gap. She paled at the effort; Imani was screaming.
“Imani, run!”
Joseph grabbed her. He and Kevin tried to run with her. But one of the Rock Crabs scuttled in front of them. The group tried to swerve. They nearly tumbled down a valley. The Rock Crabs crept over the ledges, encircling them.
“Oh my god. This isn’t happening.”
Galina looked around. Six Rock Crabs looked down at them. Their antennae-eyes stared at the food. They clicked.
Imani was screaming. The others backed up. Rose raised a finger, but her hand was shaking. Kevin looked around.
“Make a break for it when they come. Just run. And maybe some of us will get out.”
