“I suppose you’re not in trouble, then. Good. Can you please avoid making the inn detonate before I finish building it? Oh, and I’m going to get the Players of Celum later. They still haven’t come by! I think they haven’t heard the inn’s open and I forgot to tell them with all the drama.”
Lyonette passed by. Erin saw Mrsha nearly fall off her chair as she giggled silently. Erin stuck out her tongue at Lyonette’s back.
“You’re just jealous that I have all the fun. Just you wait! I’ve got new Skills and I’m gonna try them out! [Garden of Sanctuary], for one! Activate!”
Erin raised her hands. The [Princess] whirled.
“Not in here! Are you cr—”
She shielded her face. Mrsha ducked. Everyone in the [Grand Theatre] ducked. Erin’s eyes widened.
“Oops! I—”
She looked around. Nothing happened. Erin pointed at the walls.
“Um. [Garden of Sanctuary]! Go!“
She stared at the wall. Nothing happened. A magical garden did not appear, or whatever Erin was supposed to get. She stood up.
“[Garden]? Over here? Maybe this room overrides—nope?”
She tried the private dining room Lyonette had built—and then the hallway. Then upstairs. Workers constructing the hallways stared at Erin as she waved her hands. Mrsha followed Erin and shook her head.
“I know it’s not working. Well—maybe I need an actual garden first?”
Erin scratched her head. She went downstairs. Lyonette raised one brow.
“And you have a Skill that doesn’t work. I’m so incredibly jealous.”
“Hey! Rude! I’m…fairly certain it’ll work if I figure it out! And I can use my other Skill! Oh yeah. I can make fire now. Magical fire. Wanna see?”
“No. If you burn down this inn—”
“I’ll show you somewhere else! Jeeze!”
Erin sighed. Mrsha grinned, and even Lyonette had to smile.
“Is it useful?”
“Well, I was gonna cook with it or something. But I haven’t gotten it completely down. And I want to see what’s new in Liscor! If I’m not under arrest—there’s so much to do!”
Erin smiled and looked around. She saw Palt trot over.
“Oh, hey Smokey.”
“Please don’t call me that. I’m not even smoking anything. Erin, it’s a delight to have you back.”
The [Illusionist] smiled at Erin. She half-smiled back. But she could see Montressa and Beza behind them. Then Erin looked at Palt, seriously.
“Did you…deliver Isceil’s remains?”
The Centaur nodded gravely.
“We brought it in range of Fissival’s teleportation network. They…took the body. The family didn’t wish to speak to us.”
“Oh. I’m—”
Erin looked at the three [Mages]. Palt forced a smile.
“It’s a topic we’ve been over, believe me. Erin, I do need to talk to you. Not urgently, but the Ullsinoi faction—”
“Uh oh. This is their demands, right?”
Erin sighed. She propped her hands on her hips. The [Illusionist] waved his hands.
“Nothing major! But the world saw your inn. It’s an ongoing negotiation, Miss Solstice. Give and take! We help you, you help us. Believe me, mutually beneficial arrangements are something  the Elusive Lot understands. Not like some factions—”
“Palt, we can hear you badmouthing us.”
Beza shouted at Palt. The Centaur flapped a hand at her. Montressa and Beza wanted to speak to Erin too. She sighed.
“Okay, what have I gotten myself into?”
“Nothing much for now! Just—if I could have your permission to write a few…signs…outside your door? And we could discuss people with the proper signs coming to your inn? No questions asked?”
“I knew it! You want me to smuggle drugs!”
Erin shouted. Relc’s head turned. Palt winced.
“I’m not asking for that! It’s just discretion—”
“Which Erin will have and we can discuss. She upholds her commitments.”
