Interlude – The Innkeeper’s [Knight]
Page 19
The [Soldiers] were rough, crude, and still—they had well-maintained weapons and a casual confidence about them. That [General] hadn’t been the only one to take down the [Knights]. They were good [Brawlers] as well as [Soldiers].
“Why is Ser Solstice here? I told you that House Kallinad would pay his ransom and mine—”
Talia was outraged. The officer, a [Captain], who’d been taking down her details shook his head.
“House Kallinad’ll pay more than the Order of Seasons, but why do we have to go to one? You. Get money from both if you can, that’s the smart way. We’ll just see if this ‘Solstice’ fellow has anyone who wants to pay to keep him safe. That’s all.”
“Disgraceful. The Order will not forget this, nor Pheislant!”
Talia fumed. It was a considerable threat given the fact that the Order did crusade to right grievances. It was not wise to offend a [Lady] of a powerful family, either. Yet the [Captain]’s reply was a snort.
“And? There’s a lot of stuff they ‘haven’t forgotten’. I didn’t hear Pheislant declaring war.”
He smirked. Talia turned red with fury. The table she’d been sitting at began to smolder—and the [Soldiers] checked themselves.
“Stop that!”
The Summer Knight subsided and her aura faded. Ser Markus only wished he had command of his aura like hers. But both were more concerned about…

Rabbiteater. The Goblin sat there, still in his armor. He could hear the Humans murmuring. That was a good way to look at it.
Humans. And he was a Goblin. They were all—
The [Captain] turned and Rabbiteater stirred. Wait a second. That was a half-Elf. He’d just been speaking so casually that the Hobgoblin had missed his pointed ears. He didn’t look as…fancy…as Falene. On the Elven Dignity Scale, he was really close to a Ceria. Unwashed face, stubble…
Half-immortal beauty. He gestured at Ser Solstice with a frown.
“Hey. Why’s his helmet on? Get it off and get his name.”
“His oath—”
Someone shut up Talia with a prod from the butt of a spear. It was the [Lieutenant] who replied.
“This one’s some famous ‘Goblin Slayer’ from Izril, [Captain]. Unusual situation. Wiped out dozens of tribes by himself, so I hear. Swore an oath never to take off his helmet.”
“Really?”
And so it began again. Rabbiteater closed his eyes. The Order of Seasons was not shy about lauding him—or their fellow [Knights]. They’d told variations of his cover story all the way across Izril. The [Captain] listened with interest.
“What’s he done? You—Slayer. Got a tongue?”
Silence. Rabbiteater sat there. The [Captain] frowned.
“Don’t make this hard. When the [Mage] comes, we just want your name…Ser. We’re not savages. You tell us who to send a [Message] to—we’ll get your ransom, you’ll go free. We’ll feed you, make sure you don’t drop dead. Can’t say fairer than that. If you were a common [Footsoldier] we’d not be as nice.”
Rabbiteater folded his arms. The [Captain] exhaled.
“We’ll make you talk one way or the other.”
“Go ahead and torture. Have ten fingers. Start with them.”
The Goblin [Champion]-[Knight] put his hands on the table. He stared at the gauntlets. Even taking them off would reveal him. But the worst would come…
The [Captain] stared at the Goblin Slayer. He looked over his shoulder. One of the [Soldiers] whistled.
“They give ‘em steel balls in Izril, huh?”
“Or fat tongues.”
“Ser Solstice, I know you’ve sworn your vow. Don’t be unreasonable!”
Talia hissed. Markus joined her.
“He has sworn an oath, sirs. If you respect [Knight]’s vows at all, let him keep his helm! Ser Solstice would rather perish or be tortured than remove it!”
“Tree rot. This is stupid.”
