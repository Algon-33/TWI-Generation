“My duties take me far from home, father. I was in Liscor among other places. I visited Pallass—”
“Whatever brought you there?”
Zail looked affronted. Ilvriss sighed again. But he explained.
“It was unavoidable. I had to return by way of Liscor.”
“Oh. Its summer, isn’t it?”
“Yes. It is.”
Zail nodded a few times. He looked at Ilvriss and paused.
“There’s little for me to do these days. Boredom is worse than taking a lightning bolt to the chest. Your mother, now, she keeps herself busy. I should have done that. Never should have quit managing the mines. They’re in good shape?“
“Yes, father. As well as they ever have been. Would you like to see the reports…?”
Better than they ever had, actually. Zail shook his head. He looked at Ilvriss. And then he was lost again.
“Ilvriss?”
“Yes?”
His son waited. He could see the scar on Zail’s chest, past his loose robes where he had been struck by lightning. And—a slight indentation along the Drake’s scull. The scales were almost gone there. Wall Lord Zail had sacrificed much for the city he loved. At last, Zail looked around.
“I came to ask you something. What was it? My…my tower. Is it finished?”
Ilvriss exhaled slowly.
“Yes. A decade past—”
He caught himself. Nodded slowly.
“Yes, father. Would you like to see it?”
The old Drake nodded. Slowly, he got up. Ilvriss escorted him out of the study. Back to the room he had spoken to Geyasa in. He waved away Salisa and the anxious Drakes who hurried towards him. Zail caught his breath as he stepped towards the window. He looked at the newest tower, one that Gemscale funds had helped build. Ilvriss watched, his eyes on Zail’s face. Once, the Drake had been taller. A towering presence. Zail murmured softly.
“Oh. Oh, it is beautiful. When I die, my ashes should be scattered from the tower. That’s the way of it, you know.”
“I know.”
Zail paused. Then he turned his head. Ilvriss was expecting him to ask for his promise again. But the old Drake frowned. His eyes focused on Ilvriss’ hand.
“I heard you gave your ring away. You did. Who are you marrying?”
Ilvriss jumped. Reflexively, he covered his claw, but Zail had seen its absence. The old Drake straightened, looking more awake suddenly.
“I do hear about it. The ring’s gone. So. Who is it? Some Gnoll? That’s what my people tell me. Or a Human? Some…Pallass? Dullahan? Garuda? Tell me if it’s going to happen. I might as well know now.”
“None of those! I’m not marrying, father!”
Ilvriss snapped. This was the last thing he’d expected his father to pester him about! His sister, perhaps! But those damn rumors—it didn’t help that he’d spread this one himself! He growled.
“It’s not a sign of marriage. You know that.”
“I know exactly what that ring means. I gave it to you. Trust. Who do you trust enough to give that ring away?”
Wall Lord Zail snapped back. Ilvriss sighed. He felt the ring’s absence. But he didn’t need it. And he had…he paused.
“I gave it to someone who did me a great service. Who…is unique. In her own way. Who may need it more than I. It was a gesture of respect.”
“Aha! Her?”
“Father! It’s none of your concern.”
Ilvriss glared at the old Drake. Zail walked around him. He looked at Ilvriss, looking him up and down as he had a thousand times before.
“They say you left your duty to play in a border city for months. Or that you lost your head. Chased someone and lost your ring. Tell me that’s not true.”
“It’s not true.”
Ilvriss held his gaze. Zail’s eyes narrowed.
“So you didn’t flee the Goblin Lord out of cowardice? You haven’t lost your way? General Shivertail died. You were there. Where were you?”
