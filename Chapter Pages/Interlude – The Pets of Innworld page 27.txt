Interlude – The Pets of Innworld
Page 27
The Naq-Alrama needle glittered on the tip of Apista’s stinger. Apista had tried to ‘glue’ the fragment of needle with beeswax to her stinger until she’d accidentally jabbed it in frustration. It had lodged in the already-sharp queen-bee stinger, and the tip of it poked out. Apista had decided it was an upgrade. She buzzed angrily as she scouted for someone to poke.
Oh boy, she was going to sting someone in the eye with this.
The most dangerous, anti-[Mage] bee in the world buzzed ahead.
After her beloved little friend.
 
 
 
 
Author’s Note: I am done! And I’m on break for two weeks.
I’m about to fly off, so this might be up tonight…or I have to figure out how to send it on-the-go. You see, I’m taking a longer break, which I feel bad about…but I’ll be on vacation!
Also, I’m dying. Of exhaustion, nothing else. I could really use a longer break, so I’ll take it in order to write better. I’ll be back in two weeks—not three!
Someday, I will take a three-week break. When I visit London or something, next year. Hint: I’m not from London. I know I fool you with my amazing accents and characterization of Trey and Teres…
I’m rambling, I’m tired, and this was a short chapter for once! Still…still 16,000 words. I’ll see you after some rest, and try to get that revised chapter out by the time I’m back. But it really is good to have a travelling vacation. I think. We’ll see how recharged I am later! Thanks for reading and remember—don’t leave your pets behind. They’ll rise up.
See you later!
