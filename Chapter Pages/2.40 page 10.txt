“You know she’s from another world. And you wanted her to give you something useful. Something you can bring back to your tribe.”
Krshia inhales softly. I hear Brunkr growling to Mrsha in the other room and her knocking about.
“You are quick, yes? You think differently than Erin does.”
“Not necessarily better.”
“No. But you are correct. We did hope. We offered much in exchange in hopes of receiving more. But—”
Krshia shrugged.
“The thief cost us too much. It was poor luck, but my tribe will pay for it. I do not believe Erin will be able to offer anything worthy of such a debt.”
“So you’re trying to talk Brunkr out of trying to kill Lyonette.”
Krshia’s eyes flicker. She inclines her head.
“Very quick. It would undo years of work in Liscor and do more harm than good. But the debt still remains.”
“Fine. I think I understand the problem.”
I sigh, and put down the tea cup. Then I face Krshia, and raise my voice so the Gnolls listening at the doors and windows can hear.
“I will take on Erin’s debt. And I will pay it.”
The Gnoll blinks at me. Once. Twice. I grin, the wide grin of an idiot who’s betting everything with nothing in their hand.
“You are confident, yes? Do you have something of that worth?”
Eight hundred gold pieces, which I don’t actually have at the moment. 1.6% of Erin’s debt. I don’t say that out loud, though.
“I’ll find a way. I am from another world, just like Erin.”
Krshia blinks at me. But she doesn’t seem surprised.
“Mm. But that does not mean you have anything more than Erin Solstice, yes? And should this not be a great secret?”
“Things have changed.”
A certain group of idiots in Magnolia’s care proves that.
“I will pay the debt. I will find something that will erase Erin’s debt. I promise.”
Krshia studies me.
“You are confident, yes?”
“Yes.”
I hold her gaze. After a second, she nods.
“Soon. If you would erase the debt, then you must do it soon.”
“Fine.”
I am so fucked. But it’s just one part of the debt I owe. I look at the kitchen as I hear Brunkr growling and Erin laugh.
“What about Mrsha?”
Krshia nods.
“We will take her. My tribe is far to the south, but we will raise her here until we journey back.”
I hesitate. That’s what I had planned, but I remember the look in Krshia and Brunkr’s eyes.
“And she will be safe?”
“Yes.”
Barely a flicker. But it’s there. I stare at Krshia.
“Her fur is white. I thought it had to do with the Frost Faeries who saved us, but does that mean something in Gnoll culture?”
Krshia’s gaze wavers. She picks up a cube of meat and pops it into her mouth and swallows it without looking at me.
“There is…significance.”
“You mean it’s bad luck. Or an ill omen.”
“…Yes.”
“What does it mean, exactly?”
Krshia pauses.
“Don’t lie to me, Krshia Silverfang.”
She glares at me. I glare right back. Krshia sighs and scratches at her neck.
“Too quick. You are prickly, like a thorny bush, yes? But you are right. White fur is a sign among my kind. No Gnoll has white fur, except those touched by disaster.”
“Disaster?”
“Those who have lost their tribe. Those who have survived calamity. And, it is said, those who bring it.”
My throat closes up. I’m suddenly very, very glad that Mrsha is in the other room.
“None of what happened was Mrsha’s fault.”
Krshia traces a pattern on her leg.
“I am sure you tell the truth. But my people believe in such signs. Can you be certain that none of it was due to her?”
The Frost Faeries. I clench my fist and feel my nails digging into my skin, puncturing it.
“No. But she is still innocent.”
Krshia studies me and nods.
“I will take her. She will be safe with me.”
