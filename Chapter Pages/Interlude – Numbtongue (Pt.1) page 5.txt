The [Nightstalker] grinned. The Brother only grimaced. It was understandable, typical even, but the Brotherhood didn’t deal in that area. The Sisters of Chell on the other hand…
“Ah. What about the City Watch? Do they know?”
The Sister shrugged, clearly impatient as she picked up the pace.
“They know. But their new Watch Captain doesn’t want to risk blood and he’s being bribed with potions. Apparently, the last one took off to be an…[Actor]? That answer all your damn questions?”
The [Enforcer] nodded absently. It did indeed. He might not know if this Quelm was connected to the incident he was investigating, but he understood this new gang and racketeering business. A gang had worked its way into Celum’s city. Not just a gang, but a Gang, the kind of criminal element that went beyond some local [Toughs] or [Thieves]. The beginning of proper organized crime, the kind both he and the [Nightstalker] were familiar with.
This was always how it started. To the [Enforcer], the [Nightstalker], and probably the silent [Blackguard], it was as obvious as the sun what was going down. It was like…if they were [Woodcutters], they were seeing a cut along a tree’s base. They could tell you exactly how the tree would fall if things went a certain way.
On the other hand, they could spot complications, oddities like maybe a strong wind that could randomize how the tree fell. But they had seen this a hundred times; they knew the broad strokes.
New Captain of the City Watch. A potential source of gold—these matches, whatever they were. Add in some displaced villagers, a few experienced underworld folk, or just a local [Bandit] group dying off and the stragglers entering a city and you had the beginnings of a gang.
The Sister of Chell broke the silence after two more blocks of walking.
“Why all the questions? You know the score. Are you looking to move back down here? If you are, you’re not dealing with me. I’m warning you, we want this city.”
She looked back, a bit agitated. She eyed the [Enforcer], and was clearly relieved when he shook his head.
“We’re not looking to expand south at the moment. They’re yours to conversate with you when you want the pleasure.”
A grin crossed the [Nightstalker]’s face. She shrugged indolently and looked around Celum’s streets with contempt.
“We’ll wait until they actually earn more than a few gold pieces. Anyways. We’re here. Look.”
She pointed. The [Enforcer] saw they’d reached another [Alchemist] shop, clearly doing better than Stitchworks. Glass windows showed a variety of products, from low-level potions to a Tripvine bag. It wasn’t good by any of the standards of the three visitors, but the small bundle of matches put pride of place in the glass window caught the [Enforcer]’s eye.
“Interesting. I’d not mind a look at these things. Mind if we take a look? After you.”
He held the door open for the pair. The [Nightstalker] snorted, but walked in. A beaming [Shop Assistant] greeted them; the store already had a few guests this early. The young man gestured around the shop.
“Good morning! Welcome to Quelm’s Bazaar of Alchemies! Are you here for matches?”
“As a matter of fact, sir, I’d be delighted to buy some to test them out myself. May I ask what they are and what they do?”
The [Enforcer] tipped his hat to the [Assistant] and the young man’s face lit up. He quickly trotted behind the counter and got a matchbox and match. The [Nightstalker] watched with impatience as the [Shop Assistant] made his pitch.
