Luan felt his skin crawl. You could laugh at something like that on Earth. In the daylight. But in this world? Here? Nothing was off limits.
People said the gods were dead. So—sometimes, Luan stayed awake at night and wondered. If the gods were dead—
What killed them?
“Did he take the hand?”
That was all he could think to ask. Kirana shook her head.
“No. He wrote that he did not. The—woman vanished. No footprints. Dev died months afterwards.”
So no correlation. Luan sighed. But Kirana still looked bothered. That story would bother Luan too, if he let it. He needed a drink. He sighed.
“Maybe it was a [Rogue], or high-level explorer. Or a nightmare?”
“Maybe.”
“When did it happen, anyways? Daly can ask that [Adventurer] he met if she knows anyone like that.”
Kirana cracked the journal open. She frowned at the date.
“In the middle of winter.”
Luan was walking down the stairs. He stumbled. Looked over his shoulder. Kirana blinked at him.
“What?”
“…Nothing.”
The man felt his skin turn icy. And something was crawling down his back. He hesitated, and then shivered. No way. But—absolutely. His hand itched. Luan kept walking, hurrying for the kitchens. He’d have a drink, ask later. In the daylight.
He was relieved, though. Luan had assumed it was a dream, a nightmare at sea, while rowing. But that made it seem—
He was so glad he hadn’t touched her hand.

“Geneva, I’m really worried for you. You can’t keep working like this. I can remove fatigue from your muscle, but not that brain-thing! You can’t keep doing this!”
An hour later, Geneva sat in her laboratory. It wasn’t sterile, white tiles, stainless steel, or anything as good. The floorboards were wood. She’d installed a metal door, made the room airtight as possible. That meant she had to open a window, but she kept it closed when she was working with anything serious.
And she too had protective gear on. Geneva had designed it herself. There was no plastic in this world, so she had to rely on resin layers, cleaning…
Soap, rather than antiseptic. Fragile glass, and a rear vent for oxygen rather than an actual tank. It would keep out liquids, but not gas.
It helped for the Yellow Rivers treatments. Geneva checked the setting sun. Nearly time to get to the clinic. She heard the voice again.
“Geneva? Are you listening?”
“What?”
The [Doctor] snapped irritably. She heard Okasha’s voice in her head.
“I’ve been talking for the last thirty minutes! You’re not listening again! You’re tired. Get some rest.”
“I can keep going. Thanks to your breaks, I need to make up time.”
“You also need to sleep.”
“Not yet. Be quiet. I’m testing the cultures.”
Some things she’d reclaimed from her world. The glass petri dishes and cultures inside made Geneva’s skin tingle. She wasn’t qualified for this. But she was more qualified than anyone else in this world. She stared at the growing yellow amid the red. Cursed.
“Nothing’s killing them. Nothing—has Ken gotten those [Alchemists] to work on an anti-bacterial yet? Don’t they know how important this is?”
“No. He’s trying, but not many of them like working with mold, Geneva. We’re all trying. Did none of the treatments work?”
For a moment, Geneva thought the voice was coming from Okasha. But it wasn’t. She looked up.
“Paige! Stay—”
The young woman was wearing her protective gear. Still, Geneva glowered.
“I told you never to open this door when I’m working! It was locked! How—”
“Kirana has the key. Anyways, you said it wasn’t airborne.”
“As far as we know. It’s mutated once. It can do it again. What’s that?”
