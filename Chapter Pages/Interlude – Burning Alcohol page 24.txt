Interlude – Burning Alcohol

The [Princess]’s lips compressed. Her eyes flashed.
“I don’t know that she needs to see this.”
“She absolutely needs to see it. If she wants to.”
Erin shook her head. She looked at the letter. Then she whirled.
“I’m going into Liscor. Be back in a second.”
She stormed out of the inn.

“I’m sorry, Miss. But it was sent with an anonymity clause. We’re not allowed to share the details.”
The [Scribe] at the desk was unhappy, but he shook his head as Erin stood at his counter.
“You don’t know where it came from?”
“No, Miss. We’re not allowed to divulge confidential information.”
Erin paused. She narrowed her eyes.
“…Do you not know, or are you not allowed to tell me? Because it sounds like you could find out?”
The [Scribe]’s eyes flickered. Erin leaned over the counter.
“Do you know who I am?”
“Miss—”
“I’m insane, you know. They say I can spit blood and that I have a Hobgoblin [Bouncer].”
“Miss, if you threaten me, I’ll call the Watch.”
“Threaten you?”
Erin smiled, spreading her arms wide. Like Wailant. And like the [Pirate], she suddenly leaned in.
“Magus Grimalkin stays at my inn. Also, Krshia’s a great friend. And Selys. And uh—I know Olesm. Tell me where it came from. I know you can buy information from the Mage’s Guild. They’re as leaky as a sponge if you squeeze. Tell me. How much? Ten silver? A gold piece?”
She began slapping money on the counter. The [Scribe] raised his claws.
“Miss, please—”
“Do you want to be depressed? I can do depressing fire too!”
Erin was ready to cause a riot. But as it happened, it didn’t occur. The [Scribe] was looking for the bell to summon the Watch when someone slid past Erin.
“Excuse me, Erin. Ahem. May I have a word?”
Montressa du Valeross walked over to the desk. The [Mage] leaned over and tapped on the counter.
“A word with your Guildmistress? My name is Montressa du Valeross. I’m a Wistram Mage.”
The [Scribe] froze. He looked at Montressa. So did Erin.
“Get him.”
The [Aegiscaster] smiled at Erin. And the [Scribe] wilted.
A few minutes later, Montressa handed Erin a small slip of paper. Erin unfolded it wordlessly.
“That’s all we got. Did you want more?”
“Nah. I just needed to know.”
“Who was it?”
Montressa looked at Erin. The young woman raised her brows.
“A friend.”
The [Aegiscaster] hesitated. And Erin could see the little magical gears spinning in Montressa’s head. So the young woman tugged her out of the Mage’s Guild.
“You know, Palt’s told me all about factions. And how you’re supposed to report stuff. And you’re smart.”
“Thank you for saying that.”
Erin nodded. She looked at Montressa.
“Don’t report that.”
“Erin—”
The young woman held up a finger.
“Palt keeps telling me about trust. Secrets for secrets, right? That’s how Wistram works? Don’t report that. And I’ll tell you about weights. And other things. Give me a reason to trust you. And I will.”
She waited. It was a gamble. The [Aegiscaster] eyed Erin. And then she nodded slowly.
“Done. Would you like me to swear it on a truth spell?”
“Yes please.”
Erin waited. Montressa did. The young woman smiled.
“Now, do me another favor. I need you to send two [Messages].”
“To whom?”
“Falene Skystrall of the Silver Swords. And Ceria Springwalker or Pisces Jealnet of the Horns of Hammerad.”
Montressa froze. She looked at Erin. The young woman explained.
“They were both going to learn the spell. It’s silly, not knowing it. Either one works. You can send it directly, right? So the Mage’s Guild won’t listen in or Wistram?”
Slowly, the young [Mage] nodded. She put a finger to her brow.
“What do I say?”
