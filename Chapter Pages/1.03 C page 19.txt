The dagger—his dagger—is shoved hilt-deep into his chest, right where his heart would be if he’s like a Human. He’s covered in blood.
My blood.
I stagger upright, feeling a gaping…emptiness in my chest. I hear a sound. I turn, and Erille flinches away from me. I look down and see only blood and torn flesh where my chest should be.
“Oh. Sorry.”
I’m scaring her. I look at the Demon at the foot of her bed, and then the one at my feet.
Two Demons. Both dead. I did that. I did.
I should be angry, or sad. Or shocked. But I just stare at them. Dead. That’s all.
I killed them. I did it. But that doesn’t matter. I don’t care. What’s important is—is—
Blood drips to the floor. I turn to Erille. She huddles in her blankets, eyes wide, staring. But it’s important she knows. There’s no danger anymore. None.
“Just me. I did it. I’m—”
I stare down at my bloody hands and feel the deep cuts on my belly bleeding. The pain—I’ve felt worse. I clench my fingers tightly around the dagger still buried in my side. It hurts. But I’m me.
There’s no one else in here. Just Tom. Tom the [Clown].
Tom the Murderer.
“You should probably scream for help. Or something.”
I tell Erille that as I slowly sink to the ground. She looks at me and then turns, grabbing for something on her dresser. I hear her voice—very distant.
It’s all fading away. I stare towards one wall. Hey, Erille has a dresser like mine. I see the blood spattered room reflected in it, and a young man lying on top of a Demon’s body, covered in blood.
He’s me, but he’s not me. The other Tom looks up.
He grins at me. A white devil dancing in a pool of crimson. He stares at me, and I think he winks for a second. His smile is like blood. But it’s just in my head. I turn from the mirror.
“It’s all in my head. All.”
Just me. Then throughout the castle I hear a ringing noise, like bells, and hear shouting, bells and shouting and a horn now, like a siren. I listen to the sounds, and hear him whispering in my head.
It’s not over Tom. Not over. Not yet. 
“You’re just…just…”
Someone’s bent over me. Erille? She has a bottle in her hands and she’s pouring it over my chest. The world goes dark. But I can still hear him.
I’m real as you are, Tom. I’m waiting for you to let me out. This was only the beginning.
And the devil laughs, and I smile. Because he’s not real.
He’s just in my head.
