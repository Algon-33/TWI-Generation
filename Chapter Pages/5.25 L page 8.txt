Yellow Splatters looked sideways at Purple Smile. He pointed with one big hand. Purple Smile shrugged. He had no idea what was happening either. The [Sergeants] watched as Pawn kept pacing. They watched him stop and put his hands together. Was he praying? Why? The Soldiers didn’t know what was wrong, but they didn’t take their eyes off Pawn. They were observing. Listening. Learning.
And Pawn made up his mind. He had to go back tomorrow. To check on Lyonette.

The next day, Pawn waited at dawn in front of the door to The Wandering Inn. As soon as the sun rose high enough for it to be actually daytime and not night still he opened the door. To his relief, the door was connected to Liscor. Pawn stepped in and immediately saw Lyonette.
“Pawn?”
She was setting food out for the Redfang Goblins. Lyonette turned, surprised to see Pawn so early. He stepped into the inn, conscious of the rain on his carapace.
“I am sorry to come so early. Am I interrupting?”
“No, come in. And please close the door. I keep telling Erin we need a doormat—let me get you a towel.”
Lyonette hurried into the kitchen as the five Hobs sitting at their table gave Pawn the fisheye. He ignored them. As soon as Lyonette returned with a fresh towel, Pawn thanked her. He sat at a table near the fire and spoke.
“Are you well, Lyonette? Are you feeling better? I was worried that you might still be in distress.”
“You were? Well, I’m better. I feel fine now. I’m embarrassed about yesterday.”
“You’re…alright?”
Pawn stared at Lyonette hard. She gave him a cheery smile.
“I am! I think yesterday was just shock.”
“I see.”
Pawn was confused. Lyonette seemed so much better today. It was completely at odds with how she’d seemed yesterday. She hovered around his table, waving at one of the Goblins who was raising a hesitant mug.
“Sorry, Ishkr’s not in yet. We’re training new staff, but I’m the only person for breakfast. Do you mind?”
“Not at all.”
The Antinium watched Lyonette take the mug that one of the Hobgoblins offered her. She refilled it and when she returned he scrutinized her again.
“So you don’t mind losing your class? Truly?”
“Not at all. I’m glad, actually.”
Briskly, Lyonette mopped down the table.
“But you are royalty still, aren’t you?”
The [Barmaid] shrugged.
“You mean my name? Lyonette du Marquin? Forget about it. It’s just Lyonette now. I’m a [Barmaid]. Not a [Princess]. And that’s alright. That’s perfect, really.”
“Really?”
At last Lyonette looked up with a frown.
“Really, Pawn.”
He met her gaze. She looked annoyed now. Pawn hadn’t intended that. He looked away meekly.
“Okay then. I was simply worried.”
Lyonette smiled.
“And I appreciate it. Thank you, again, Pawn. But I really should get back to work. Can I get you anything? Or did you want to talk to Erin again?”
Of course. He had his duties. Pawn shifted in his chair. He should really talk to Erin. But he couldn’t help but feel like his conversation with Lyonette had gone all wrong. She said she was okay. But was she really? He couldn’t imagine it. She was a [Princess]. She had been. She’d taken pride in it. And now it was gone. That couldn’t be okay.
And yet, if she said so, what could he do? Pawn watched Lyonette turn away. He opened his mandibles before he could stop himself.
“Wait. Can we not talk further?”
She turned back, surprised.
“Talk?”
Pawn hesitated. That had slipped out.
“I do not mean to take you from your duties. But it has been a long time since we have chatted together. Too long.”
“It has been a while. We used to talk back when Erin was gone and I was in my inn. Starving.”
