She couldn’t understand. What was Silvenia doing? Bazeth stood right next to the strange barrier that blocked sight and sound, glaive in hand. He glanced at her.
“No, Flora of Humanity. We are n—”
His weapon blurred. He knocked something out of the air and Flora jumped. An arrow hit the ground.
“It’s not safe here. Stay behind me.”
The Demon [Champion] cautioned her. Flora stepped back. This wasn’t war as she knew it. And despite his words—so many Demons were dying.
“Had Silvenia ordered this? Why?”
“We do not question her.”
Bazeth looked uncomfortable. He had been a senior commander until her…return. He stared at the distant bodies falling as they tried to reclaim the walls. Flora felt her gun in hand, sweat beading in her palm. She saw the flight of Garudas taking to the sky.
“They’re going to warn the others!”
She pointed. They were out of range, even with a Skill. Bazeth stirred. He spoke crisply into something.
An amulet. Not like a speaking stone. Primitive magic, Silvenia called it. This one reflected something. A laughing face. Well—
“Silvenia. The Blighted Kingdom is about to warn 4th Wall. What are your orders?”
The half-Elf smiled.
“Wait, Bazeth. Do you see, F-Flora?”
“No, Silvenia. This is a slaughter.”
“I know. W-wait. I h-have been waiting.”
“For what? Why?”
In the image, the half-Elf pointed. She smiled—her lips trying to move around their injuries. And suddenly—her eyes lit up.
“Because. It makes it funnier. Watch.”
She pointed d—

Merish didn’t see the flash. His head was turned to the Demon officer. He heard the thunder, felt the world shake. He stumbled—turned.
The [Messengers] were gone. The Harpies flew away from the crater. Paxhal’s wing jerked in midair.
“Mage spell! Some kind of siege bombardment! Take cover! T—”
Cirille’s words were cut off by another sound. More thunder. Merish saw a spider web reach down out of the clouds. But it wasn’t silk.
It was lightning. Hundreds of lightning bolts, striking in a single flash of light. The world lit up and his vision went dark. The Gnoll covered his eyes.
When he opened them—the skies were clear.
“Paxhal?”
Ossky whispered. The Garuda was gone. Still shapes lay on the ground. Feathers fell out of the air. Slowly, Cirille pulled herself upright.
“A [Mage]? Some [Aeromancer]? What—”

“Now. Bazeth. You may advance with the reinforcements. Happy hunting. Try to level up.”
Silvenia called. Flora was still half-blinded from the distant lightning strikes. Bazeth looked up sharply.
“Reinforcements? Wh—”
“[Pillar of Flame].”
It came down from the heavens. Like the first time she had shown Flora. Like biblical wrath. To mock her ideas of power.

Fire. It struck the walls. Cirille’s head turned.
“General Telvir?”
The Dullahan vanished. The pillar of flames shot up a hundred feet. It rolled across the walls.
And the world became quiet. The defenders of 5th Wall, the officers, even the Demons stopped. Slowly, the pillar of fire moved down the wall. Chasing the fleeing [Soldiers]. Turning everything to ash.
“That is a Tier 6 spell. At least.”
Uxel whispered. He looked up, towards where the fire had come from. Cirille trembled.
“They just killed our command. They just killed Paxhal. We have to—”
“Cirille! Get off the walls!”
The shout came from below. Cirille turned. Merish, Uxel, and herself realized the same thing Ser Vorn was shouting as the [Knight] galloped along the wall. They were t—

“I think we just lost General Telvir.”
Richard couldn’t take his eyes off the pillar of fire. The [General] had been right—right—
