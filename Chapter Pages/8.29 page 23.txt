Thirty years? Jericha whispered incredulously, but Wiskeria flicked her a glance and shook her head. She walked over and whispered to the orb.
“That’s not a good thing. That means she’s going to hold a grudge forever. If she goes after Mrsha when she’s a hundred…I’ll get her to forswear thirty years and renegotiate when twenty have passed and add another thirty. She’ll forget Mrsha’s a Gnoll, not a half-Elf.”
“Does that…work?”
The woman eyed Wiskeria, who didn’t look more than twenty something herself. The [Witch] flipped her hat up.
“It’s worked for six people so far—and I learned the trick from an older [Witch] who knew Belavierr. It’s the best we can ask for. Alright mother, thirty years. Mrsha only. No harm. You can’t touch her, cast a spell, or even speak to her.”
The hat grumped. Wiskeria poked it.
“I know you, mother. Do we have a deal? What are your terms?”
She sat down, sighing. Ryoka began to come to. She stared, blearily, at Wiskeria talking to her hat. The [Witch] of law rubbed at her face, clearly annoyed.
“Fine. I’ll write you a letter. Two letters every four months, at least. That’s my offer. At least two hundred words each. Deal?”
Ryoka blinked a few times. She turned her head with effort to Sammial.
“Is Wiskeria talking to her hat?”
“Yes.”
Sammial could have elaborated, but the Wind Runner just nodded.
“Checks out.”
Her eyes rolled up in her head and she passed out for a while longer. Wiskeria was sighing.
“Okay. Okay. I’ll bake you something too. With love. Yes, mine. I’ll add a drop. Do we have a deal?”
She seemed to conclude whatever deal with the [Witch] by placing the hat on her head. Then it became silent—normal. Jericha stared in a kind of awe as Wiskeria turned, adjusting her spectacles.
“You…persuaded the Spider to leave this girl alone?”
The [Witch] shrugged.
“I did. On that note—oh. Ryoka’s asleep. We’ll try to help with that curse, but we’d need to be closer to her. Alevica could go if she’s in the area, but she’s hard to track down. Tell Ryoka that I’ll try to visit her. Right after I bake something.”
She sighed again. Jericha looked at Wiskeria. She had all kinds of notes and questions and this conversation had given her much to research.
Somehow, though, even Jericha didn’t quite dare to ask Wiskeria about her relationship with her mother. She nodded, and closed the spell, then hurried off to write down…everything.

“Ter—him. Him. If I could just ask him…”
Ryoka was muttering when Sammial and Hethon came back. Jericha had gone off to put in an order for more researching with House Veltras’ contacts. She opened her eyes wide.
“Jericha. Did I say anything to her? I didn’t say…anything?”
“N-no…”
It was a sign of how sick Ryoka was that Hethon’s reply actually fooled her. She relaxed.
“I’ll tell him. And…someone else has to find Mrsha. Who?”
“Father will help. Unless she went south. He says sending soldiers past Liscor is an act of war.”
Hethon had heard Jericha sending [Messages] to Tyrion. Ryoka muttered a curse.
“Someone. Who? Klbkch is gone. Hawk? Where’s…she can do it.”
Her eyes opened again.
“I need to send another [Message].”
“I’ll get Jericha.”
Hethon looked for the door. Sammial stopped him.
“She’s just going to tell!”
“Don’t tell. Can’t. She’s important.”
The two boys looked at each other. Sammial scratched his head.
“Maybe Ullim?”
“I’ve got it!”
Hethon came to an idea. He darted from the room. Sammial stared after his older brother and saw Hethon race back in, furtively.
“What’s that?”
“Ullim’s [Message] book.”
“You can’t use that! You’ll get into trouble!”
