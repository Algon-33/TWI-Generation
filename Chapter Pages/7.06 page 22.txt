Oh no. Oh no. Mrsha let go. She dropped to the floor and stared. Oh no. The cake was ruined. Mrsha stared.
It took her a minute to process what had happened. First, Mrsha was shocked. Then she was upset. Angry at herself. Stupid Mrsha! Then she was sad. Tears welled up in her eyes. The cake Erin had worked so hard on. And then—
She was going to get in so much trouble. The Gnoll cub began to breathe faster and faster. She panicked. She was going to get smacked! Krshia would do it in a heartbeat! She was going to be put in time-out and never eat cake again. She was going to—
There wasn’t even a chance of salvaging the cake. It was ruined. Mrsha looked at it. She heard Erin arguing with the others. Mrsha crept from the kitchen.
“Look, I just want a rune. I’ll pay you. No favors! Who do I have to pay for a rune? Palt? Palt can do it! No, I’m not answering all your questions. Where am I from? Noneya! Noneya business! Boom!”
Erin self-fived and felt stupid. The others stared at her. Someone began to laugh hysterically.
“Oh, Ancestors. That’s good.”
A very naked Drake leaned against the door he’d just come in and wheezed. Everyone stared at him. Saliss took one look at Erin and guffawed.
“Noneya business! I need to use that! Hi. I’m Saliss.”
Erin turned bright red. She shuffled her feet.
“…I’m never telling that joke again. What do you want?”
“Excuse me!”
Lyonette shouted. She’d gone white at Saliss’ nudity. She looked around.
“Mrsha! Cover your eyes!”
The Gnoll had a heart attack as she crept away. Mrsha looked at Saliss. He posed.
“Don’t fear, Miss. It’s nothing unnatural—”
“Get out! Who is this?”
“That’s Saliss—”
“Mrsha, don’t look. Go upstairs!”
Lyonette hurried over to Mrsha. The Gnoll scampered up the stairs, her heart beating out of her chest. She didn’t know. Not yet. The Drake was arguing with the others in the inn, many of whom had never seen him before. He had an entire city to flash and he was starting with the inn.
But he was small potatoes. Mrsha was terrified. She nodded as Lyonette told her not to come down until she dealt with that Drake. Erin was pointing at her kitchen.
Mrsha hid in her room. Under the bed. For good measure, she put her paws over her eyes. She had good ears. Erin was letting Lyonette fight a losing battle with Saliss. [Princess] or not, she was outmatched by the peerless, nudist hero of Pallass.
A new cast, a new inn. Mrsha heard Erin leading the way into the kitchen. There was an exclamation. Silence.
And then a voice.
“Mrsha! Get down here right this instant, young miss!”
Mrsha shook with fear. She looked around as she bolted from her bed. She had to run! Erin was furious—then Lyonette heard. And she was worse.
“Mrsha? Down here, right now.”
The Gnoll shot into the hallway. At the far end, sunlight beckoned. Worker Antinium were constructing the rest of the second floor. But Mrsha could run across the roof—get off the inn!
“Mrsha! I’m counting to three! One! Two!”
Erin’s voice was loud. Mrsha ran. One of the Worker Antinium looked at her, and put out a hand.
“This one is not supposed to allow you onto the roof. Please return to the inn.”
He blocked Mrsha from going further. The Gnoll looked at him. She tried to jump. He carefully caught her and put her down.
“Mrsha, don’t you dare run away.”
Lyonette was coming up the stairs slowly. She wasn’t shouting like Erin. She was being very…serious. That was worse. Mrsha scrabbled as the Worker put her down in the finished hallway. Run! Run!
