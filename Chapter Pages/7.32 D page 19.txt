Numbtongue’s arms were crossed. He didn’t like this dance of information. To him, it felt like fighting in the dark. All spotting the enemy and quick clashes of blades. Exposing too much was how you died. But it was Bird who spoke up next.
“Erin. You are lying.”
The others looked at him. Bird stared at the notes. Erin bit her lip.
“I am, Bird. But we have to be careful. We don’t know if we can trust them.”
The Worker nodded agreeably.
“This is true. However, if I was them and I was listening to you, Erin, I would not trust you either. Because you are lying. If you are lying, how can you ask to trust someone? This makes no sense.”
Mrsha’s head hurt. But Erin looked up. Lyonette opened her mouth.
“Erin…”
“You think I should tell the truth, Bird?”
The Worker looked up at her.
“Did you lie to Pawn or we when you taught us chess? I do not think so. If you did—we would not have liked you. Lies are like hollow bricks. You cannot build much with them. It all falls apart.”
The [Innkeeper] looked at him. She took a deep breath.
 
[Joseph] – …There are others.
[Geneva] – Can you clarify?
[Joseph] – Sorry, but I wanted to be cautious. There are others. I have met them. And I have received letters. From Wistram. There are others, but I cannot tell you where or how many. I do not know who these Selphids are.
[Geneva] – That is understandable. Thank you for being honest.
[Joseph] – To be more honest—we were found by someone. An individual. We were eventually able to leave, but more people know about us. I was not part of this, but there was a…phone call. Or something.
[Geneva] – I know.
 
Ken raised his iPhone. The others clustered around even more closely. Idis was asking questions. Geneva ignored them.
In the inn, Erin tried to recall what Ryoka had said.
 
[Joseph] – Do you know who ‘Kent Scott’ is?
[Geneva] – No. Do you?
[Joseph] – No. Honesty set to maximum this time. However—I do know there are others. There is a [Singer] in Terandria. I think that a person is in Chandrar.
[Geneva] – Rémi Canada?
[Joseph] – Yes! Did you read his newspaper-thingy?
 
The United Nations company was chuckling. ‘Honesty set to maximum’, ‘newspaper-thingy’—they were relaxing. Geneva herself smiled as she replied.
 
[Geneva] – We get the news. We have a scrying orb.
[Joseph] – Me too! Those are the ones I’m aware of. The group in Rhir, Wistram…and now you.
[Geneva] – And the ones in Izril?
[Joseph] – Yes. They’re safe. As safe as they can be. Are you safe?
 
The mood turned serious again. Daly pushed forwards.
“What does he mean? Ask—”
 
[Geneva] – Please clarify by ‘safe’.
[Joseph] – If something bad happens, will you be able to protect yourself?
[Geneva] – I have security, yes. I operate a clinic. It is secure.
[Joseph] – No. I mean, monsters.
[Geneva] – Can you explain further?
[Joseph] – Yes. Monsters. I have been attacked multiple times since coming to this world by monsters. Not just people. Real…monsters. Not Goblins. They’re not monsters.
 
That came from Numbtongue.
 
[Geneva] – Do you mean undead? I am familiar with them, but Talenqual is a large city with a mercenary company protecting it.
[Joseph] – Mercenaries? That doesn’t matter. Monsters can overrun a city. I have seen a horde of undead nearly destroy a city. There are worse things. Crelers, for instance.
[Geneva] – Have you encountered them yourself, Joseph?
[Joseph] – Yes. I’ve killed monsters. But I am no [Warrior]. One of us was teleported to a Creler nest with friends. She was the only survivor.
 
“Fucking hell. This guy’s fought Crelers?”
Daly exclaimed. Siri checked her crossbow.
