Yes, he could feel it. It wasn’t coincidence. It wasn’t chance. This was only the start. And everything he had witnessed, all the little pieces, they were falling into place. Something was happening.
The world was beginning to move again. Behind Niers, on the chessboard, a piece slowly slid forwards and stopped.
