Flos brought down the sword. A head rolled and for a second blood spurted. The mirror jerked in Teres’ hands. The world heard a cry.
“Next.”
The King of Destruction turned. The [Commander] found himself being dragged forwards.
“No! No! I had no knowledge, I swear—”
“You let them die.”
The King of Destruction swung the blade. A second head fell. The mirror jerked away—and for a second a young woman’s face was visible. But then a paw caught the mirror.
A white-furred Gnoll took the mirror. Sailt. He pointed it back, steadily. The King of Destruction gestured.
Another man was brought forwards. Another officer in the force of Belchan’s soldiers. And then a woman. She was one of the villagers who’d fought the Gnolls. She spat and cursed him.
The sword fell, glittering. Orthenon’s blade was magical, and the hand that held it was steady. Flos Reimarch didn’t blink. He brought the sword down casually. Once, twice, a dozen times.
There were hundreds of villagers. The sword kept on falling. They began to scream, to plead or argue. One shouted as he was brought before Flos.
“You cannot do this! We are citizens of Belchan! We are people protected by—”
His words halted mid-flow as the King of Destruction looked at him. Flos’ green eyes shone in the fading light. And his red and gold hair was darker, drenched in blood. He stared through the man.
“Citizens? People? I see nothing in front of me worthy of either word.”
He swung his sword. A body toppled, was dragged backwards. His [Soldiers] watched silently. The Gnolls stared. Even the fifteen children.
“Next.”
The [Steward] moved in front of his [King]. He put a hand on Flos’ arm.
“My King. Your time is wasted on them. Allow your soldiers to take care of the rest.”
For a second the King of Destruction paused. Then he nodded. He pointed.
“Let the others go. Only the officers. And every warrior in the village. Let the others go unless they fight.”
“You’re executing them? All of them?”
Everyone had forgotten Noass was there. He had been a statue. Flos looked back at the mirror. He stared at Noass, blankly. Then he turned.
“This will be avenged! This is war!”
Some of Belchan’s soldiers were screaming as their officers were beheaded. Flos looked at them. And his blank look began to change at last.
“War? Of course it is. Go. Return and tell your people of what you have seen today. And bring your armies. Because I will slaughter them. I will kill all of your armies and burn your cities to ash. Until nothing remains.”
The [Soldiers] stared. Flos raised his voice. It was growing louder. He pointed, and the men and woman backed away. The [King] cast the sword into the ground and it sank deep, tip-first.
“Flee back to your capital. When we next meet, I will drown Belchan in the blood of your worthless lot! Begone!”
He clenched his hands. They hesitated. Flos turned. His soldiers stared. His people watched, his vassals. And his subjects.
Gnolls. White fur, varied. Chieftain Nelrra. Those standing in the bar with Rufelt.
They looked at him. A Human man, who raged over their deaths. Who would go to war for a single Gnoll child.
Their [King].
Flos Reimarch turned. Those not dying were staring at him. Now he raged. His tendons stood out, and his eyes bulged. His face became a rictus, mask. He howled and his face contorted as his hands became claws, and his two vassals seized him. The King of Destruction raged and the ground itself began to shake. People fled as he bellowed at the mirror.
