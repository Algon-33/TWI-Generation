Solstice (Pt. 9)
Page 6
Ivolethe had gone mad. She was shouting at the Faerie King. He had not even entered the gateway and already, Ryoka felt the power flowing past her.
She was begging him to do the same. She could have watched that procession forever. But it was also so hard to watch. Look how they rode to war. Again and again.
See what it had cost.
Someone seized her shoulder. Ivolethe. She dragged Ryoka towards the gateway, ahead of the Faerie King.
“Ivolethe! What are you doing?”
Ryoka stared at Oberon. He was watching them as he rode/walked. Ivolethe was panting.
“We must find Erin’s life! This way! This way!”
“But the Faerie King—”
“It does not matter! Not anymore! The laws do not matter! With me! We go to find—”
They leapt through the doorway. Stumbled into—

It was all breaking apart. The Blighted King saw something tearing apart the connection. Or was it…mending a gap?
Either way, what had been poised to be his great opening, a rift rather than a gateway perhaps, but still a link of torn reality—
Was closing. He had no idea what it was, not fully. Not even Nereshal could explain as he dragged himself up, head bleeding from where he had fallen.
“Your Majesty, stop!”
“My armies! My prophesied heroes! Come to me! To me!”
The Blighted King ran over the failing ritual’s sigils. Past the High Mages struggling against a far superior foe. He almost saw the opening.
“—”
There was a sound coming from the other side. A sound unlike any Othius had ever heard. Strange bells. Shouts of alarm.
Another world lay beyond. Othius stopped in front of it, adjusted his garments, his crown.
“—you. Who—?”
There was something beyond. People! They were asking the most obvious question. The question anyone asked.
Earth? Othius had read all the accounts. Talked to Sir Richard and all the others. He saw—he almost saw someone on the other side. Many people. Where was this?
The image—flickered. He saw a room full of people. A strange multi-bridged place with huge metal things rolling along. Countless faces. The room—asking a question.
He had prepared a speech for this eventuality. Othius reached for his bag of holding. Then he gave up.
Again, the question came. Who are you?
He almost heard it. From many sources. Many places where the worlds connected. The ritual was screaming around him. Othius raised his voice and spoke, shouting to that world beyond.
“I would be your King.”
The voices stopped. He heard gasps. Questions. Someone was saying…
A prayer.
Othius’ ears were ringing. He shouted on, desperately, reciting his speech.
“I call you from your world. To me! To fight evil in every form it takes!”
The voices from beyond listened. The Blighted King roared, beseeching them.
“Send me your righteous souls, to fight the last war! The eternal war! Until the Demons are driven back and hell itself is cleansed! Bring your greatest armies to make war upon the end of the world! This is the day of reckoning and I call you to my side!”
Screaming. Voices—he reached out, but the world’s link was fraying—

The Faerie King was coming. The five were fighting desperately.

Ryoka Griffin landed in Innworld with Ivolethe. She stared at the Frost Faerie.
“Why are we here?”
“I told you! Erin sleeps in this world? Cure her in this! We follow the threads of fate! Um…here!”
The faerie was rummaging around somewhere. Ryoka focused around her.
“Wait. Where the hell are we? This isn’t the party?”
The faerie kicked over something. It crashed onto the floor. She rounded on Ryoka.
“Of course not, you fool! Do you think that party has what Erin Solstice needs? We are where her hope lies!”
