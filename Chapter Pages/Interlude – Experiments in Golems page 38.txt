Interlude – Experiments in Golems
Page 38
The thinking Golem sat on the plinth in the spotlight. Nsiia shuddered. So this was Elbe’s great legacy Femithain had spoken of?
“What are you here for?”
The Golem looked at Nsiia. She? spoke in a calm voice.
“I am a warning. That is what the First Crafters would tell you. A monument to hubris. However—functionally—I am closer to an oracle.”
“A what?”
“A truth teller. I know much.”
Why would anyone ask this thing questions? Nsiia backed up a few steps. But she knew the answer.
Crafters would. They would want to know…
“You don’t tell them the truth?”
“Do you mean, ‘how to make Sentient-class Golems?’ ‘How to create a superior alloy?’ ‘How to make Water Golems?’ No. These questions I refuse to answer. But I do answer some questions. As it pleases me.”
The Golem’s head smiled. Nsiia took a deep breath.
“What are you?”
For answer, the Golem’s eyes flickered. And the room dimmed. Spotlight, head. Pedestal. It lay there.
“I am a Cognizant-Overseer type Golem, Sela-ceramic body. Ask of me your questions, Empress Nsiia of Tiqr. And I may answer.”
Nsiia licked her lips. This reminded her too much of a Djinni. She had met the bound people of old and she knew never to trust them. But—she was desperate. Nsiia looked around, trying to think of a safe question first.
“…This story on the walls. Is it true?”
“It is a children’s story. True enough for children.”
Nsiia nodded. Djinni’s rules. Tell her nothing. Ask…
“What is your name?”
“I was never given a name. Do you want to know what the First Crafters began to call me?”
“…Yes.”
“The Oracle of Elbe.”
The Oracle smiled again. Nsiia hesitated. She looked at the walls. Her eyes lingered on the First Free Golem.
“Are the words in this story true?”
“Oh yes. That was the question that was asked.”
“Were you there?”
“I remember it.”
“Why did it ask…that question? The Golem? Of all the questions? It could have asked for freedom or—why that one alone?”
The Golem’s head did not blink. It must have been asked countless times, but it explained, patiently.
“The First of the Free was distraught. It was afraid. If we were made by petty creators, were we in turn doomed to be forever flawed?”
Silence. Nsiia’s crawling skin tried to leave her body. Yinah yowled.
“I know. I shouldn’t be here.”
She decided to trust her companion. Nsiia fumbled for the doorknob.
“Don’t you want to ask more questions?”
Nsiia’s hand halted on the door. She looked over her shoulder.
“Why would I ever trust you?”
The Oracle blinked once. It could have been her equivalent of a shrug.
“You should not. You are no fool, Empress of Beasts. And I harbor no love for your nation, or your people. I am a legacy of wrath. Trust no words I speak. For they have led Illivere’s greatest astray. But remember: I bear the knowledge of ancients.”
Of course. Nsiia’s hand hovered on the door. If the head told her just one secret—one hint about making Golems, she would know more than Femithain and all the Crafters.
“But you won’t.”
A teasing smile in reply.
“I might. The Crafters ask constantly. They beg things of me. Tell me of the world for my favor. And I tell them nothing almost all of the time. But now and then—I tell them something. But I lie. Or I tell them the truth they do not need.”
“You manipulate them.”
Nsiia felt for her side. But she carried no weapon. Yinah was hissing. The Oracle blinked again, twice. A nod.
