“What do you want?”
Belavierr didn’t reply. She just stared at Ryoka. And then she smiled again.
“Would you like to know how to meet your friend?”
“Wh—”
This time Ryoka’s breath caught. And Belavierr’s smile widened.
“I heard you as he burned me. And you saw them. The strangers.”
Ryoka backed up. The fae. She’d heard her? She stammered.
“She’s gone. She’s been banished and she’ll never, ever see me again. Ever. There’s no way she can defy her ruler.”
Belavierr tilted her head. Still smiling.
“Even they have laws. Even they have a price. There is a way. And I know of it. Would you like to meet her again?”
See her again? Ryoka jerked her head, shook it rapidly.
“No. No, no, no—I won’t give you my life. Go away! Leave me alone!”
She turned to run. But there Belavierr stood. And the Stitch Witch stood over her. Her voice was inescapable. It whispered in Ryoka’s ear, ran through the forest.
“I don’t want your life. You are my daughter’s…friend. All I ask is something small. A little thing. Easy to pay.”
Ryoka knew she shouldn’t ask. She shouldn’t. But Belavierr wouldn’t let her go. So Ryoka asked.
“What is it?”
Belavierr told her. Ryoka went still.
“Just that?”
“Just that.”
“It won’t harm anyone?”
Belavierr only smiled. Ryoka looked at her. It was so simple. But it could hurt people. She was sure of it. Somehow. Some way.
“But just think. You could see her again. Maybe even take her with you. They have rules. You will never see her again but for my help.”
Ryoka wavered. And she looked up into that terrible, knowing smile. And she looked at Belavierr as she raised her arm. Ryoka knew.
A [Witch]’s deal. It was funny. Everyone knew what the right answer was. Everyone knew, even in those old days. But that was the thing. The thing people forgot. When the devil reached out, he always offered the most important thing to you in the world. Nothing less.
Ivolethe.
Ryoka looked up and wondered if this was how Tagil and Califor had felt. Standing before her, the Stitch Witch smiled. Her lips curved up and if Ryoka looked closely, between the rings in Belavierr’s eyes, she could see damnation laughing at her.
Belavierr slowly held out one hand. Ryoka stared at it and she thought of her dearest friend. Slowly, trembling, she raised her right hand and stared at the missing fingers. She looked into Belavierr’s eyes.
And she sighed.
