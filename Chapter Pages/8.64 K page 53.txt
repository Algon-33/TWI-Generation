They gave him a strange look. The boy who had caused this all. His friends…aside from Emirea—that was, the Quarass.
“I thought you were my friend.”
Trey knew it was the stupidest thing for him to feel betrayed after all he’d done, but he told the girl that anyways. As she wrote on a [Message] scroll, the Quarass glanced up briefly.
“Am I not? You and I will see more of each other, Trey. Especially for what you intend. Both things. But we will speak on that later. You are the key to Germina’s future or death. All of you children are.”
He didn’t know what she meant, at first. But then Trey saw them.
Standing together. A handful.
Some of the Earthers had been captured. Some had gone with Doroumata, or fled with the Drakes. Where they went now? Trey didn’t know. But he did see something that was entirely Rasea Zecrew.
A [Pirate] stole everything, after all. She had her own morality; she had let the Drowned Folk go because of their truce, and even refrained from attacking the Drakes. She had even helped toss the Gold-rank team on their ship.
And she had found that last group of Earthers and taken them aboard. There were a handful of them. But the one who Trey saw first, who was staring at him…
Elena. The [Beautician] looked at Trey, her gaze not even fully betrayed. Not even sure what he was. Trey looked at her, and put his head down. Minizi patted him on the head, and Amerys breathed in.
“I am free. Once more, my [King]. And…”
She hesitated, closed her eyes, and spoke, the words that made Gazi look up at her old friend, Rasea Zecrew turn and laugh, and the Quarass close her eyes and think.
“Let all those who hold chains, beware.”

Author’s Note: When I reach the end of an arc, or volume, especially something I have planned for a long, long time—Raelt’s duel being a good example—I get nervous.
I am a ball of stress suspended over a pool of sharks on fire. And the pool is filled with oil, so the sharks are probably dead, but that’s how it feels. I don’t often post about it.
I write ‘I’m tired’ a lot and I like to complain, but I am always nervous about writing big chapters. Because you get one chance in web serials. You can revise and edit…but a lot of readers will only read your story once, the first time.
All this to say I hope you enjoyed this. Or didn’t enjoy this, but found it thrilling, sad, emotional…found it something rather than nothing, which is the worst a story can be.
It was a long time coming. And we have more to go. In fact, I think next chapter might be the Navah Wolfe chapter and so it might go to her and you’ll see it sometime later and much improved! So be warned the next one might not come out but come later.
I uh…I’m gonna have to work hard on that. But I do like to write. I like telling stories well, so the nightmare is telling it poorly. Hope you enjoyed and see you next chapter…which might be actually in a week…
