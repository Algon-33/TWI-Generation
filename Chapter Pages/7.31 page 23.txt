The Watch retreated. The mob spotted them and broke into a run. There was no individual person there—who might respect the Watch, know a few [Guards] personally. It was just angry people whose every grudge was out in the open. The Watch retreated. The injured Worker hid in an alley.
Bird felt the Worker’s fear.
So too did the Free Queen. And Xrn. In the Hive, Yellow Splatters looked up as the first Workers began to flee into the Hive. Pawn ran for them and saw the blood.

Erin had thought it was bad before. Now—it was worse.
Pelt’s sword was almost an afterthought as she returned to The Wandering Inn and found that things had escalated without her knowing. The Invrisil broadcast had lit sparks. For once, Maviola’s analogies were appropriate.
“They’re kicking out Humans. Attacking Workers. But they’re mostly after members of The Golden Triangle. I should have stopped Noass and Sir Relz! I just thought they were going to report what was happening! But people saw the riots in Invrisil and—it got bad, Erin.”
Drassi was panting. She’d gone into Liscor but fled after only a few minutes. Ishkr was missing. He’d been allowed to go home early.
But that was a bad thing, now. Numbtongue was inspecting his new sword. He grunted.
“Inn’s safe. No one else. Don’t go into hallway.”
He sat by the door to the common room. Ironically, the magic door had been moved to the common room. The danger wasn’t something coming through there—it was a mob converging on the inn. Erin looked around.
“What’s Zevara doing?”
“Holding parts of the city. Economic districts, the Watch House—only a few streets. There aren’t enough [Guards].”
Drassi answered for Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked askance.
“What about the rest of the city? She has to protect the Workers! People are attacking them?”
“Yes.”
Bird had come down from his tower. He had brought his bow. He was, Erin realized, handing out crossbows to the other Workers. She saw Numbtongue nodding.
“No. What are you two doing?”
Both Worker and Goblin looked at Erin.
“Preparing.”
“For a riot? No. We’re not killing people. We can still do something. Maviola. You have your aura! I have [Crowd Control].”
“Don’t be an idiot. You can’t control a riot. Even a [Queen] hides when the mob marches on her palace!”
Maviola snapped. Erin shook her head. She looked around.
“Palt! Get over here! And my lanterns! Where are they?”
She had an idea. The [Innkeeper] marched into the kitchen. When she came back—she was holding something.
The cold-fire lantern. Maviola eyed it.
“What is that?”
“Depressing fire. Palt—come with me. Montressa, Beza, do you know any spells like Palt?”
The Centaur [Illusionist] looked up. So did Montressa and Bezale. They blinked to be addressed by Erin.
“Us? Well—sure. But why?”
“We’re going into Liscor. To stop the riots. Palt, you know [Calm], right. Can’t you cast it on…?”
Erin waved her hand at the door. The Centaur frowned worriedly.
“I have a lot of spells, Erin. But mass mind-control spells aren’t a good idea.”
“I don’t want you to control them. I just want you to stop them from attacking people. I’ll use this.”
Erin opened the shutter of her lantern. Maviola shaded her eyes as the depressing, cold flame washed over her. Montressa shuddered.
“Hey, that’s—wait, you’re going into Liscor?”
“Yeah. And you’re coming too.”
“Erin. This is not a good idea.”
Lyonette began. But the [Innkeeper] whirled.
“I should’ve tried this on Invrisil’s riots. Palt, Montressa, Beza—Maviola? Uh—Lady Bethal?”
The [Lady] looked up blankly from where she sat with Thomast. Maviola just shook her head.
