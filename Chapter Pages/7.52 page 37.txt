“Yes. Good Raskghar. We surrender. Kind not-Gnolls have mercy. Asoma be good slave. Clean. Lift things. Kill things for masters.”
The Raskghar smiled like a lying child standing over a dead pet. Erin shook her head.
“We don’t want slaves. And we know what you did.”
Asoma looked at Erin curiously.
“You are not Gnolls.”
Why do you care? Erin shook her head. It was not like talking to Numbtongue, or even one of the Goblins like Rags with a poor command of language. Her [Dangersense] was a constant buzz in this place.
“Why did you kill Gnolls?”
A blank look. Then Asoma bowed her head to the ground.
“Bad things. Very sad! We never do again! Mercy! Surrender!”
The other Raskghar in her cell and who were listening echoed the words, sounding piteous. But Erin had not missed the blank expression on Asoma’s face where she’d been thinking of what to say.
She looked towards Calruz’ cell. He watched her and nodded.
Look at them. There was not an ounce of contrition in Asoma, no matter how she made her face contort.
“Do Raskghar know how to cry?”
The words slipped out of Erin. Asoma looked up.
“Yes. Cry much. No tears left?”
“Dead gods, shut up.”
One of the [Guards] muttered. They were possessed of the same loathing of this moment as Erin. She shook her head. This—this was having the opposite effect she wanted.
“Asoma. Just you speak. Asoma—why did you surrender? What did the Raskghar want?”
The Raskghar’s eyes flickered. Then she pointed at an open sore that had erased fur in a patch across her chest, one of many.
“Bad pain. Bad sick. Make stop. Come here for—”
“Mercy. Yes. And when you’re all better, what will you do?”
Another flicker of the eyes. Then a smile.
“Surrender. Not do anything. Good Raskghar. Eat, sleep, grow more…”
A mutter. Asoma’s ears twitched and she amended the statement quickly.
“Grow bigger. Stronger. Serve masters.”
It was so—Erin closed her eyes. She couldn’t even lie for Asoma. Grow more Raskghar? Until the ‘silly masters’ dropped their guard and the Raskghar went back into the dungeon, maybe with some Gnolls?
What was she supposed to do? Erin—wanted—to draw her knife. To demand to know which Raskghar had killed Gnolls. And then?
Maybe that was it. She had never gotten that vibe from Numbtongue. But perhaps—Erin opened her eyes.
And she saw a murderer smiling back. Not like her. Not with the same reasons as a Human might have. But—someone who had done evil.
She had seen people like that before. Different than a monster. Erin remembered a face. A terrible suspicion.
Regrika Blackpaw. The Named Adventurer had killed Ulrien, murdered Brunkr. When Erin had confronted her and the other Drake—they had that same look in their eyes.
Everything but remorse. Erin opened her eyes. Yes—it was simple, really.
“Are you sorry for what you’ve done?”
The Raskghar opened her mouth at once. Erin cut her off.
“No. Be silent. Listen. Don’t lie to me. I can tell when you’re lying. I have a Sk—I have great magic. See?”
She raised her hand. And produced a little flame of sadness. Because…the Raskghar locked eyes on it.
“Powerful magic.”
“Oh yes. And I want to know. I won’t be angry. Are you sad?”
Asoma hesitated. Her eyes flickered.
“You’re going to lie to me. Don’t think. Just answer.”
The Raskghar muttered in their language. One of the [Guards] banged on the bars and there was silence. Erin changed tactics.
“Let’s go even simpler, Asoma. Are you afraid of dying?”
“Yes.”
The Raskghar nodded. Erin nodded. Animals. Animals could be afraid. That was what separated animals from rocks and stuff. But people?
