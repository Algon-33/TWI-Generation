“But. I’d rather try than regret it. It’s called giving aid. Because people need it. Because you can. I don’t have any argument weaker than that. And it reminds me of a village I heard about, once. A place that was in the middle of nowhere. It didn’t have much. And—hell—it got buried by an avalanche.”
Durene and Prost froze. Ryoka looked up.
“And then it lost all of its winter stores. There was no reason for anyone to help that village. None at all. But someone did. He found people in the snow. And he asked me to deliver them food in a blizzard. Because he cared for people when no one else would. If he were here, what do you think he’d do?”
She smiled slightly as she looked around the room. Lady Rie bit her lip as she glanced at Prost’s face.
“I’ll—I can have Nesor send a [Message].”
“No, Rie. I think I know what his Majesty will say.”
Prost sighed. He looked down at the map, filled with tiny dots. Durene looked down. They were so small. But they were. People’s homes. People like her. She scrubbed at her eyes. And she looked at Ryoka. Why did she have to make so much sense?
“We can spare some wagons. And Beniar. It’ll be just food and wood, mainly. But—arrows? We can send a few bows as well. I’ll see what we can spare.”
Prost strode out of the room before Rie could object. Ryoka smiled, relieved, and Charlay patted her on the shoulder. Rie sighed loudly, but she followed him without a word. Ryoka turned.
“Durene.”
“It makes sense. But it’s going to be costly. I know it’s what Laken would do. I guess—is this something a [Paladin] would do?”
Durene looked at Ryoka, hoping the answer was yes. But Ryoka just shook her head.
“I can’t answer that. And I have to tell you something Durene.”
She took a deep breath.
“I don’t have a brilliant idea for you. I gave up on trying those after Laken used his trebuchets to attack a Drake city. But I do know what’s right and what’s wrong. And I want to do what’s right. But I have to tell you—I can’t help you, Durene.”
The words stung. But Durene had expected as much after Ryoka had shouted at her yesterday. The half-Troll girl looked down.
“That’s fine. So long as you stick around for Riverfarm…”
“No, I mean, I can’t help you, Durene. You need to do that to yourself. That’s what I’ve been meaning to tell you. I didn’t get it at first. But that’s your problem.”
Ryoka walked around the desk to look up at Durene. Her face was concerned. Durene blinked at her.
“What do you mean? Help myself? I do plenty for myself. It’s just that I don’t know what to do for everyone else.”
The shorter Human girl shook her head slowly.
“I don’t think that’s the problem. Listen to how you speak, Durene. I have. Laken says this. Prost and Rie say that. Wiskeria won’t make an army, so that’s that. You don’t make decisions for yourself.”
“I do! All the time! It’s just that I trust Laken. And he has better ideas that I do!”
Durene recoiled, strung. Ryoka sighed.
“But he doesn’t. That’s the problem. You think he does, but Durene—he’s just a guy.”
The half-Troll girl felt a spark of fury in her breast. How dare Ryoka? She didn’t understand Laken at all.
“He’s an [Emperor].”
“And what was he when he arrived in Riverfarm?”
Durene hesitated.
“But—he just didn’t have the class. He was always—”
Ryoka put a hand on Durene’s shoulder. Or rather, tried to. She settled for Durene’s arm and squeezed gently. Durene started at the contact. People didn’t really touch her. On purpose. Laken did, but—Ryoka looked up at her.
