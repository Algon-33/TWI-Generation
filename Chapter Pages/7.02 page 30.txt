“Other flames? I don’t know. The Skill is [Like Fire, Memory].”
“Which implies it’s memory that changes the nature of the fire. Can you make a happy flame?”
The Drake looked at Erin. She shook her head.
“No. I can’t. Not right now.”
She looked down. Erin had tried. She’d tried to think of something other than Toren. But even if she smiled, right now she was—Erin wiped at her eyes. She looked up as Saliss made a sound in the cell opposite hers.
“Ah, perfect! I can cool these potions—oops, sorry. Go on. You were crying?”
Erin glared at him. Saliss looked back. He had that smile. It was knowing, annoying, and reminded her of Pisces. If Pisces was a nudist. No—it wasn’t really Pisces. It was…Erin didn’t know how to explain it. Someone knowingly playing up his silliness. Who did that remind her of?
“I’m sorry I can’t be happy, you—you jerk!”
The Drake laughed lightly. He waved the torch at Erin and the pale flame flickered.
“I didn’t say it was a bad thing. But listen. You say sad, but I say you’re wallowing in it. Pigs do that. And I’ll grant you that Humans look closer to pigs than anything but a shaved Gnoll, but cheer up, please! This flame’s bumming me out.”
He produced a clear bottle and poured it on the blue fire and it went out.
“Aha! Got it!”
“Hey!”
Saliss tossed the burnt bit of wood aside. He whirled to face Erin and clapped his claws together.
“You’re clearly depressed, and your Skill is causing trouble. It’s my duty to help you out, Erin. So let’s cheer you up!”
“Please don’t. I just want to rest.”
Erin shook her head. Saliss ignored her. He looked around his cell, and then snapped his claws.
“You know what cheers me up? And gets me arrested? Dancing. Watch this!”
He did a little jig. Erin stared at him.
“Stop that. It’s not funny and you’re naked.”
“Well, have you ever seen a naked Drake dancing? No? This not doing it for you? How about this?”
Saliss slid out of his cell. He did a little tap dance on the ground, his claws taking the place of shoes. Erin stared at him.
“Stop. Really.”
“I wanted to be a [Performer], you know. Okay, I can see this isn’t entertaining. How about—this?”
Saliss did a twirl in place. Erin stared at him. He looked ridiculous. The Drake poised with one leg up, balancing on his tail. He waggled his brows at her.
“Huh?”
She snorted. Erin had to snort, in disbelief as much as anything else. She held up a hand.
“Stop! Really, I appreciate it, but I want you to stop. Don’t you understand words?”
“I understand that I’m not getting to you. Let me try another one. How about Terandrian waltzing? La, la dee da—”
The Drake hummed something like a formal tune and glided across the stone floor. Erin stared at him. She had to say it.
“You’re crazy.”
Saliss stopped dancing, looking deeply offended.
“Me? Is it a crime to dance? If it is, lock me away! But watch out! I’m not going to stop! Watch me!”
He leapt forwards. Erin saw him twirl down the length of the prison. Other inmates saw Saliss flash by them. Erin heard their raised voice, shouting in outrage.
“What the—”
“Ancestors! My eyes! Put some clothes on!”
“Oh dead gods, he’s out of his cell! Hey! Prison break! Put him back in! No one wants to see this!”
They began shouting for the [Guards]. Erin poked her head out of the bars as prisoners swore as Saliss danced by. And the [Alchemist] was dancing! He pirouetted, leapt, and then shook his body as he came back towards Erin.
He was good at dancing! It was like watching a performer. Saliss strutted past Erin, and then did a move like a disco dancer. He grinned at her.
