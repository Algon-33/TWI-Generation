It was like Eldavin could read their thoughts. He saw a snap vote called, the [Mages] beginning to argue, but Teura spoke.
“Archmage Eldavin moves for an immediate vote.”
“Without discussion?”
Archmage Blackwood argued. Eldavin raised his hand.
“Will you draw out Wistram’s petty politics before the world’s eye, Archmage Blackwood? If you would like, let us see where the lines are drawn.”
The Archmage of Dullahans hesitated. So did the Council; they’d seen how you could be embarrassed in front of the camera, and suddenly every [Mage] was checking their posture, robes, face for grime…
Teura went on.
“A snap vote for condemning Ailendamus. All members of Wistram’s Magic Council, please signal your approval, disapproval, or your silence via spell.”
Eldavin stood there, calm as could be. He knew the likely outcome, and it was only a gesture. If a powerful one.
Gestures mattered. They always mattered. A symbol was more than just meaning in the hearts of mortals.
They lived off symbols. Off of belief. Once, they had countless millions of followers and made mighty things. Great war, great mercy, great calamity. There were so many. 
But remember the greatest of them all. First, the God of Leaders and Rulers. Head of his pantheon, he who ruled over even his kind. Tamaroth. 
…He had a beard. What did he look like? Their faces changed. They wore many shapes. He had a beard. Stop asking questions, you little h…
Something fuzzed. Eldavin’s smile flickered. As if he were watching the vote. What was that next word? Little…half-Elf?
He tried to continue. Who was telling this to him? His teacher?
His mother?
Who was she?
“Next? Next…I suppose, among the most powerful, came the one who presided over death. Oh, yes. There was an afterwards. There still is. It used to belong to her. The Three-In-One. Goddess of Death. Goddess of the Afterlife, Kasigna. Most feared. Most beloved. Why beloved?”
Someone chuckled. Eldavin’s head turned sightlessly. He looked up, seeking a mismatched gaze. Such sad laughter.
“You will understand, someday. Imagine what that could mean. No? Feared and beloved for what she could grant. Next? Ah…ah. Perhaps now it is time to scare you. Don’t hide! You don’t even know what you’re supposed to be scared of, silly little Teri.”
“Who?”
Who?
The [Mages] rose, glowing lights flashing across his vision. Eldavin’s heart—he felt at it.
“Though you should be wary. Wary of what lies beyond. Not beyond the horizon, but further still. Some of them came from so far that they were foreign to even their kind—or so it was said. Such as the Deity of the Forgotten. First of the Lost. First of Nothing. Furthest. Traveller. God of Seekers. It was not male, nor female. It was not…known. They called it Norechl. Perhaps it named itself. That one, even the greatest feared, and not for strength.”
“Grand Magus Eldavin? Archmage?”
He stirred. The Archmage of Memory looked around and realized it was done. The Council looked at each other, and then at the half-Elf. They stood, condemning Ailendamus. Eldavin’s lips moved.
“Oh. Well, then. Good job, I suppose.”
His audience was slack-jawed. Eldavin blinked at them, and the words came out simply, those other words echoing in the back of his mind.
Names. One of them was so loud something stirred.
He who ruled Secrets, Magic, and Knowledge. God of Scholars and Magic. God of Studies.
Emerrhain.
A young man shivered in the back, watching Eldavin look about. The half-Elf’s voice was quiet, weighed down by something. Time, perhaps.
“Should I be amazed? We have censured Ailendamus. Well done.”
