“That is not A’ctelios Salash. But it comes from the same place. It is no Old One. They are those that survive in the deeps. This is a thing Drath hunts. This—is what should not be.”
“They walk the world’s seam.”
Someone whispered. A rhyme meant for…a verse from the edge of the world. All the ghosts stared ahead. Then someone else spoke. The Sage of a Hundred Thousand Secrets.
“Those are the things that must never reach land. They are hunted from Cenidau to Drath. Yet they are killed. How…how does this come to this land?”
No one had an answer. Erin was shivering. She saw Gerial try to put an arm around Cawe. She looked at the umbrella for reassurance. Then—as her head swiveled across that distant horizon—she inhaled. There was no breath to catch, but Erin froze.
“There’s another one.”
Every ghost looked left. A ghost of a warrior uttered a soft oath.
“No.”
“This is impossible. Those are not…not…”
Queen Merindue hugged herself. The Queen of Nerrhavia’s Fallen stared ahead.
“Those are not ghosts.”
They were not. Such things left no ghosts. They should not have life.
Perhaps they didn’t. Perhaps that was why they came. But how? Why now?
There were places even Dragons did not fly. Places [Sailors] never went. A span where even ghosts did not walk.
From that edge of nothingness, that foreign zone…they came.
First one.
Then two.
Then…more.
They were rising across the horizon. Such that, even from afar, you could see them. Lesser and greater—but only the worst of them could climb…
“What has Norechl done?”
Tamaroth was the first to speak. His eyes were wide. Even he—even the five were frozen with the sheer horror of it.
This was beyond madness. Why did they come? This was a suicide for them, surely.
The question had a simple answer. They saw it coming. Striding across the water.
It had no face.
It had no real shape.
It had no identity, but it was.
Like them. But not.
Norechl. It was smiling.
God of the Lost. First of Nothing.
“You! What have you done?”
It was laughing. Kasigna raged, but Norechl laughed. And now they saw it. The countless shapes rising from that forbidden deep carved out of the world. The things that should never walk under sun.
They were following Norechl. It had fallen down.
Fallen over the edge.
Suicide for any but it. Somehow—it had survived down there. And it, it—that demented, twisted thing—
Had led them up.
Not just up. Not just convinced them to follow it—no, they were hunting, greedily following it—
Norechl had led them here. Out of where they should have appeared. An impossibility for any but them. After all…
It was only a matter of perspective.
They came. Too many to count, rising from every direction. To Terandria’s north. To Izril and Chandrar’s east, and Chandrar’s south. To the west of Baleros. From Rhir. Across from Drath…too many to stop.
In the lands of the dead. An army to break any stronghold. A gambit that would end all. The five. Norechl itself.
Ghosts.
Creation.
So nothing laughed. The Furthest Traveller brought ruin. The ghosts stared at what slowly pulled itself up. They rested there. Some fought each other. Most were so tired. It had been a long, long…climb.
Some had even gotten…
Lost.
Yet they sensed what lay ahead and came forwards greedily. Slowly. Towards the ghosts.
“This is the end.”
Khelta broke the long silence. Erin Solstice jerked her head away. The ghosts stirred.
They had been staring, watching the figures coming up. How long? None of them knew. Only that now—now—they turned away from that sight. Towards Khelta.
