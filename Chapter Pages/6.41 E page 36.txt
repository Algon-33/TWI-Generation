“Durene. I’m not saying Laken’s all wrong. But—the person who’ll tell you what to do? The person you’re waiting for. It’s not me. And it’s not Laken! Neither of us are perfect role models. Or even good ones!”
She spread her arms, helplessly.
“You can’t rely on him to tell you what to do. I know. He helped you when no one else would, right? He gave you a class. Gave you…a purpose. Worth. But he can’t give you everything. And if you come back, you’re the one leaning on him. If you can’t make your own decisions, your own choices, if you’re not you without Laken, you can’t give him anything.”
Durene rocked back. This hurt. More than any insult could. She clenched a hand, realized what she was doing, and unclenched it.
“But—I’m his protector. I can do that for him! What am I supposed to be if not that? I’m not good with words, Ryoka. I can’t do what you do. See? And I can’t be smart like you, or Lady Rie.”
“I’m not asking you to, Durene. I’m just asking you to decide what you want by yourself. You can ask for help. Everyone needs help. But I can’t carry you. Like Prost said. What I can do is reach out if you’re drowning. But you do have to learn to swim.”
The half-Troll girl bent down. She felt crushed by Ryoka’s words in a way nothing had hit her before. Not even that Hob. She had to sit on the ground. Hug her knees. Ryoka’s words made sense. But—it was so hard. She didn’t know what to say. But Ryoka wasn’t leaving; Durene could still feel her arm on her shoulder, patting awkwardly.
“Durene. I know it’s hard—but you’re the toughest girl I’ve met. Literally. You can wrestle Bismarck. Not just that. You’re kind. You helped Wiskeria where no one else would. You took Laken in. You’re not a brute. And you’re not a monster. You can be a [Paladin]. You can be a [Farmer]. But you do have to choose.”
The half-Troll girl didn’t respond. Ryoka paused, and then went on.
“Durene—”
“I can swim.”
“Huh?”
Durene didn’t look up. She muttered.
“I can swim. I taught myself. Riverfarm has a river. I can swim.”
Unseen by her, Ryoka smiled.
“There you go. And look—I don’t mean I’m going to just shut you out. I’ve been rude to you. But I can help. Not tell you what to do.”
“But who am I supposed to be?”
Durene didn’t like the petulant note in her voice. She looked up, ashamed by the stinging in her eyes.
“I wasn’t anyone before I met Laken, Ryoka. Just some girl no one liked. And I’m strong, but is that it?”
“No—no. You could be—”
Ryoka hesitated. Durene shouted.
“Aha! See? What am I besides the half-Troll girl?”
“I—”
“Well, you are one. Half-Troll, that is.”
The voice came from behind Ryoka. The City Runner looked around. Charlay waved a hand.
“Hi. I’m still here. You forgot about me, didn’t you?”
The two girls paused. They had. Charlay trotted forwards a few steps. She pointed at Durene.
“You’re half-Troll.”
“Charlay, this isn’t helping—”
“Shush, Ryoka. Let me finish. Durene. Listen. I know what your problem is.”
“You do?”
The Centauress nodded with complete certainty.
“Absolutely. You’re thinking like a Human. They do this all the time. Ryoka doesn’t, but no one told you because you live among Humans. Typical.”
“Charlay.”
“Shush. Durene. You’re half-Troll. I’m a Centaur! Look at me!”
Charlay spread her arms, gesturing towards her horse-half. Durene looked at her. Charlay was as unique as she was. No—more so. The Centauress was different in one respect though; she was proud. She poked a finger into her chest and then jabbed Ryoka in the side. The Human girl yelped.
