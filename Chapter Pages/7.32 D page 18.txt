Erin got up and stormed out the door. Lyonette came hurrying in, demanding answers. Mrsha was clinging to Jelaqua’s shoulders. After a moment, Erin ran back into the room.
 
[Joseph] – Nineteen.
[Geneva] – I see.
 
A pause, then. The United Nations company conferred. Lyonette, Numbtongue, Mrsha, and Bird sat together. Still no one else. Jelaqua listened as they conferred.
“…I lied. Okay? They’re from this Selphid group. The Minds.”
“I’ve heard of them. You should be careful, Erin.”
Lyonette shuddered. Jelaqua glanced at her and the [Princess] blushed.
“I’m sorry, Jelaqua. But I heard—”
“…No. You’re right to be wary. The Minds are on our side. No one else’s.”
By ‘our’, she meant Ulinde and herself.
“Be careful.”
Numbtongue murmured to Erin. She nodded. Bird was sitting there, gamely reading the notes along with Mrsha. She was worried too.
The conversation resumed.
 
[Geneva] – Let’s be open, Joseph. I am a [Doctor] working in Talenqual. I am attempting to bring some medical knowledge from home to here. It is difficult. I am currently trying to find a cure for the Yellow Rivers bacteria that is in danger of becoming a full-blown pandemic.
 
Numbtongue and Mrsha started. Lyonette blinked and went to grab the scrying orb.
 
[Joseph] – I’ve heard of that! How bad is it?
[Geneva] – Very bad. The disease is spreading quickly. Where are you?
[Joseph] – In an inn in Liscor. I’m alone.
[Geneva] – I see.
 
Silence. The United Nations company eyed each other.
“If we get a knock at the door in the next few days, we’re in trouble.”
“That’s what Calectus’ company is for. We can at least hope they can deal with Wistram [Mages].”
“Assuming Wistram is the only player.”
They frowned as Geneva dictated another response.
 
[Geneva] – I saw you playing soccer on the scrying orb. How did that happen?
[Joseph] – Coincidence, mainly. I was playing a game and a [Mage] decided to broadcast it.
[Geneva] – The Ullsinoi Faction? The Centaur?
[Joseph] – Yes. He’s a friend. But I’m not affiliated with Wistram. Actually—they’re looking for us. You should be careful.
[Geneva] – Really? Can you elaborate?
[Joseph] – Wistram Academy is finding people from Earth. Earthers. They are sending [Mages] to get us. With or without our consent.
[Geneva] – And they told you this?
[Joseph] – They tried to get me to come with them.
[Geneva] – Did they attempt to force you?
 
Erin took a deep breath. Ulinde waited, nervous. The others looked at her. The [Innkeeper] saw Lyonette clenching her hands.
“Erin…”
“It’s dangerous.”
 
[Joseph] – Yes. They failed because I had friends who protected me. The Centaur struck a deal; I’m under the protection of one of Wistram’s factions.
[Geneva] – I see.
 
Anarchy in the United Nations company.
 
[Geneva] – Please keep my identity secret.
[Joseph] – I will. The Ullsinoi Faction is not as active as the other ones. I believe they are trustworthy. What was it like when you arrived here? Are there more people from Earth or are you the only one? Are you in danger?
[Geneva] – That’s a difficult question to answer. One moment.
 
“Oh no. I think they know I’m lying. Ulinde?”
Erin was sweating. The [Spellslinger] shrugged helplessly.
“There’s no nuance, Erin. I’m just getting the replies and repeating them verbatim.”
“Offer them something, Erin. Tell them about Wistram. Or Magnolia. That’s not a big secret.”
“They’ll want to know about Magnolia, then.”
Erin argued. She was thinking about Ryoka’s iPhone thing. Should she ask…? But Geneva had gone silent. And Erin feared…
