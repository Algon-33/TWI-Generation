Interlude – Pisces (Revised)

But for him, none of them would have made it. The Djinni attracted the horrors, slowed them and secured their exit. Everyone ran.
Pisces got separated from the others as something pulled one of the [Guards] screaming into the darkness. He dodged left—and found himself alone.
Could he escape? He had to live first! Pisces ran, swearing, looking around, looking for—
He found her by one of the doors to the courtyards. Igheriz’s caravan and Hrome’s were fleeing, pursued by shapes, protected by Azam’s glowing form. Emir Riqre’s people were dying.
Screams. Pisces stopped, panting. He raised his hands to defend himself or fight past…
“Eloque?”
The stitched…Lizardwoman looked at him, eyes wide. She had stopped laughing, by now. She stood there, ignored by the very things she had helped unleash.
Her kin. As tortured as she was.
“It’s done. I’m done. I’ve freed us all.”
She lifted something in her hands. A dagger. Pisces saw her angle it at her chest, and then Eloque stopped to look at her arms. The sewn stitching between her scales—she looked at him.
“I can’t be free of him. You see?”
She gestured at the collar at her neck. Her claws trembled as she lifted the blade. She laughed.
“I can’t even do it myself. Leave me. I’ll stay here. They’ll free me.”
Eloque looked back. Pisces heard the last of the people within dying. He looked at her. Back.
“No. Don’t—”
It was a death more horrible than he could imagine. He could not imagine the crazed things would remember what she had done. Eloque shook her head.
“I will not live like this. Do you not see what he did to me? Look? He wanted to make me like him. I can’t even remove the thread. It’s in me.”
She gestured at her body. Pisces looked at her.
“Don’t. Not here. Don’t die. Surely someone is waiting for you? Even—”
Even me. They were waiting for him. Eloque looked at Pisces. She laughed, and it sounded like glass breaking.
“I don’t want them to see me! I don’t want to live like this! Don’t you know what he does? Leciaun? Every day is like that.”
“I know.”
But Pisces didn’t know. He couldn’t imagine. He didn’t even know if she was wrong. He looked past her.
“We can run. They don’t know where we are.”
“There’s nothing for me. What would I do, even if I was freed? Like this? I’m a monster. Where would I go?”
She shouted at him. The [Necromancer] heard a sound from behind. Even so, he looked at her. The Gold-rank adventurer, the [Necromancer], looked at Eloque.
“No. I know monsters. You aren’t one. Igheriz can’t make you into one. There is somewhere safe. There’s a future for people like us.”
He looked past her. Straight past her, into that past. Looking at the [Necromancer] who had been exiled from Wistram, who had lost his friends. Who trusted no one and nothing. Who lied and stole and…had been coming to this place down Az’kerash’s lonely road.
Until he met a young woman who had protected him despite it all. Who made fun of him, but who refused to let him die just for being a [Necromancer].
He reached out. He just had to bring Erin back. And then…
“Come on.”
The young man took her arm. Eloque made a sound, but followed him as they ran.

For a moment, as they ran out of the keep, Pisces realized he was free. His hand went up to his neck and he remembered that the Emir had removed his collar!
He was free. Riqre was dead.
Pisces slowed. His eyes widened. Eloque, following him, saw the [Necromancer] slow. She wondered if he had changed his mind. Then…he blurred forwards. Her eyes widened as Pisces [Flash Stepped] forwards.
“My magic! My Skills!”
