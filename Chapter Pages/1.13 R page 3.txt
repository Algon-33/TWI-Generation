She filled her water bottle, hoping the clear water was potable and walked on. Her feet hurt. But she had to keep going. There was no turning back.

As she popped the fifth blood blister, Ryoka wished she’d brought shoes. But she hadn’t and the pain was only fitting. So she kept walking. And only now, in the silence of slower motion could she hear her thoughts again.
She wished she couldn’t.

It was all a mistake. All of it*. I should never have come to Esthelm. I should have kept running.
 
*Not a mistake. Your fault. You fool. Fool.
 
My feet hurt. They’re in agony. The ground is broken. But if I keep walking I can go on. My calluses are tough. They’re—
I hit her. I shouldn’t have. And Calruz. That Yvlon…
I—shouldn’t have done it**.
 
**Of course not. You fucking idiot.
 
But what could I have done? She challenged me and Calruz was—it was because he was rude to Garia***.
 
***No it wasn’t. It was you. You idiot. You fool. Foolish, stupid, inbred bitch without a shred of gratitude for the people who saved you! HEALED YOU. Gave you a hand when everyone else turned their backs and YOU ATTACKED THEM AND HURT—
 
I try to erase the voices in my head. But they keep talking. Blaming. And they’re right.
This is all my fault.
I burn bridges as I breathe. I hurt people with my words and what I do. It sounds fine to me, until I remember that there are good people in this world. In every world.
I can still remember the feeling of hitting Ceria. I can still taste blood. Feel my fists and feet kicking Calruz.
It feels like a dream. Or—a waking nightmare. But it happened. And the sensation is not unfamiliar to me.
I have done this before. Many times before.
How many times is many? Enough so that I can recall sitting in small rooms, waiting for my parents to talk with teachers or the police. But those were fights and I was usually acting in self-defense even if only I saw it that way.
This is different.
This was wrong.
My feet hurt. A sharp burst of agony—I stop and pick the sharp rock out of the bridge of my foot. It’s just physical pain. Not important.
Why did I do it? Because I wanted to fight. Because I hate their levels. So I’ve said. But Ceria—
 
“But someone who rejects the way the world works just because she doesn’t like it—that’s new.”
 
Not because I don’t like it. Because the world is wrong.
Say who? Me. But that’s idiotic. Without Levels how would anyone survive against monsters? Perhaps—there are ways. But this is the way the world works. Why do I resist it?
Better…better to die an idiot than a slave.
Madness. This is all wrong. I hurt them. I hurt the ones who were kind to me. What did I think I was doing? I’ve cut off ties, estranged myself from adventurers, Magnolia, the Runner’s Guild—
To hell with them all. I don’t need them.
I do.
I don’t.
Ryoka Griffin doesn’t need friends. She’s lived so far without them.
Lived under her parent’s influence and money, you mean. Ryoka Griffin hasn’t tasted the real world. And she never would have. But here I can’t survive this way.
Why not? Who is Ryoka Griffin? Why does she need anyone?
I am Ryoka Griffin. But what does that mean? It’s just a name. Not even one I chose. But it’s mine. All I have.
 
Define Ryoka Griffin for me, then. Go ahead. Do it.
 
Smart. Brilliant. Or good at taking IQ tests. A clean bill of health—no physical illnesses, flaws, or anything else. Talented. The kind of student they look for in ivy league schools.
Flawed.
