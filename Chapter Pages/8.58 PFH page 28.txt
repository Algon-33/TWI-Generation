Walls of ice were rising across the plaza. More to guard Omusc. Ceria slowed amid a playground of deadly shapes. A labyrinth of killing edges. She fired [Ice Spikes] from both hands, picking off anyone in the open. And still more ice rose, gleaming traps.
[Battlefield of the Frozen World].
Ceria Springwalker stood in the middle of her ground. Her territory. Revine’s hands were shaking.
Now, the Bloodtear Pirates had seen the battle. They were forming up. Not squads, but by the hundred. So were the Bleakbeaks. This was a flashpoint, and Ceria was still alone.
She had created a dome in the middle of her battlefield spell to protect her. Spells were hitting it, but the ice held.
What was she doing? Figures were flooding into the battlefield—but the traps were static. There was danger there, but only if there was fighting and confusion. A [Raider] charged past a wall of ice, and a hand shot out and grabbed their throat.
A hand? A claw of rough ice. The [Raider] screamed, and something lurched out of the wall of ice. A blocky, jagged thing, roughly humanoid, clawing, an open mouth of frozen water biting.
“Monsters! Monsters in the—”
A [Pirate] spun and slashed at another figure coming out of an [Ice Wall]. The Lesser Frost Elemental staggered, half its face gone, but kept attacking. The [Pirate] hacked it down in a shower of ice—but more were appearing.
They were tough. Unlike the slick, half-melted [Ice Floor], these monsters took arrows to the face that barely dug into their bodies.
“[Glaciersheet Ice].”
Revine murmured. She saw them attacking, forcing back the [Pirates]. But that wasn’t enough. They had killed true monsters at sea and were continuing to advance. Except…
One fell to her knees. She slowed, and her friends reached for her, then recoiled.
Cold. She shouted, and someone blasted her with flames—but then they went out. The Drowned Woman’s lips turned blue. Her shivering stopped.
The advancing [Pirates] saw the half-Elf sitting in the dome of ice shift her gaze. They dodged—but what was there to dodge? Nothing. The cold ate at them. They retreated or froze.
[Aura of Rime].

Each of her Skills and spells at work. Ceria Springwalker left the dome of ice a second before a floating pillar of earth hammered through the roof. She spun, going up a ramp, and [Ice Spikes] rained down around her.
“Enough! Fall back!”
The [Pirates] below her were falling back. The Bleakbeaks had already retreated. The [Frost Elementals] were flooding the field. Just two dozen; Ceria felt herself panting.
The Bloodtear Pirates quit the plaza, her battlefield of ice. There was no point. They couldn’t even get near her.
Except for…Ceria looked up and saw a grinning face. A pale, orange flush in dead skin.
A Selphid.
A Bloodtear Pirate.
With a hat. And a wand. The [Captain] pointed, and a pillar of earth punched through the ramp Ceria was standing on. She hit the ground with a grunt.
“Four o’my crew. You’ll die once and we’ll call it square, eh?”
The Bloodtear [Captain] grinned. Ceria sat up.
“It’s a Drowned Night. They knew the risks. Or did you think it was your night?”
The [Captain] recoiled. Some of the [Pirates] even laughed, but the Selphid narrowed her gaze.
“They call me Shipbreaker. Hammers of stone. Let’s see whose magic is stronger, eh, Ice Squirrel? Walls or hammers.”
“Wouldn’t you rather walk away? You or I could die. It doesn’t have to go this way.”
Ceria offered hopefully. She saw the [Captain] laugh. The half-Elf sighed.
“Thought not.”
