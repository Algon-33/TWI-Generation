Mrsha had used a Skill that could evade even what was probably a very powerful smell-enhancing potion Saliss had used. She had snuck away. And then…what? Had she run and continued to run? That was a possibility, but Mrsha having that level of fear was an odd bet. Pyrite kept thinking.
“I can find her.”
A voice spoke. Numbtongue’s shoulders stiffened. He didn’t look behind him. He knew who was speaking. Because it wasn’t a physical voice. It was in his mind.
“Let me help. If she’s in danger, I can find her at once.”
Slowly, Numbtongue turned around. He stared at the other Goblin.
Reiss, the Goblin Lord, stood in the hallway. He looked as he had died. A hole ran through his chest and he had been cut. He looked as real as anything to Numbtongue, though. But the Hobgoblin knew he was dead.
“Go away.”
The [Bard] gritted his teeth. Reiss shook his head.
“You need me. I can help you. I can’t leave. I’m—I don’t know what I am. Not a ghost. I thought I left.”
So did Numbtongue. He remembered the hill, and the Goblins disappearing. He had seen Reiss. The other Goblin nodded. He could read Numbtongue’s thoughts.
“So what am I? A soul? A fragment? A memory? Let me help you. That’s why I’m here.”
“No.”
Numbtongue folded his arms. Pyrite was telling him to be careful too. But the other Hobgoblin hadn’t said ‘no’. He had a list of benefits and potential consequences. But Numbtongue said no.
Reiss had killed Headscratcher. Because of him, Garen, and so many others were dead. Reiss nodded.
“But let me help you. Use me. You need my power. You have no idea what terrors rule this world. You need my power. I can find the Gnoll child.”
“How?”
Numbtongue glared. Reiss raised one hand, touched an eye.
“[Detect Life]. I can find her.”
“Other [Mage] could do. Go away.”
The Hobgoblin turned away. Reiss sighed.
“If you refuse, it will be like the Crelers. You need power.”
Pyrite agreed. Numbtongue told both to shut up. His shoulders hunched. Below, he heard Erin’s voice.
Mrsha.
“[A Minute—]”
The Hobgoblin’s shoulders straightened. He turned. Pyrite blinked.
Reiss was gone. Odd, that. The Hobgoblin spent one second thinking over why. Different class. Of course. The [Magestone Chieftain] nodded. Then he focused all of his power on helping Numbtongue.
“Gnoll is gone. No smell, not seen—”
He paced around the room, thinking it over. The odds of Mrsha escaping so many eyes and running so far was remote. Ergo, she hadn’t run. She also hadn’t been attacked. Blood smelled strongest. Think. What—
“Ah. The door.”
The Hobgoblin strode downstairs. Pure logic. He saw Erin disappearing into the magic door in Liscor.
“Have you seen Mrsha?”
He asked Olesm, who was going through to Liscor. The Drake jumped.
“Numbtongue? No! Erin was just going to check Liscor—”
“Ah.”
Pyrite nodded. He let the Drake go through and closed the door. Thoughtfully, Pyrite inspected the dial.
There were a few settings.
Liscor, Celum, Esthelm, Pallass. Also, the Bloodfields, and the red gemstone for the Goblin cave.
You could rule out Liscor and Pallass at once. Thoughtfully, The Hobgoblin shook his head at the Bloodfields door. Mrsha wasn’t stupid. He slowly turned the dial to Esthelm, then shook his head.
“Unfamiliar.”
That left one option—no, two. The Hobgoblin eyed the red mana stone. He switched to it, pulled the door open.
Nothing happened. It was dead. The Hobgoblin shrugged. He felt his minute evaporating. He switched the dial.
“Ce—”
“—lum.”
Numbtongue finished the sentence. Pyrite’s detective work had led him to the right conclusion. He thanked Pyrite in his head. Then he swung open the door.
