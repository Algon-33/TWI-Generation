Yoriven felt a chill run over him, sudden goosebumps. He looked around—and realized the strange [Knight] had an aura. It was not threatening, or the other [Knights] now watching would have intervened.
Yet he heard it. Cheering voices. Shouting for Rabbiteater to get up.
Bravery.
And at the same time? Yoriven’s eyes widened.
What do I see?
Confusion. Two ideas mixing at once. Bravery and home. Yoriven felt like he was home, in his mother’s kitchen. He also saw the [Knight]’s resolve.
What did that look like to you? What it looked like, perhaps to this [Knight]—
A flicker of fur. An anxious little ball of white fur, a dog? No—a little girl offering him a towel? Someone clapping him on the shoulder, a pointed grin. Yoriven could almost see green…
Then he saw the [Knight]’s head rise. No…
The [Champion]’s. Heavy chains of exhaustion weighed down his limbs. Yet they rose. And his gaze seemed to burn behind that helmet. And Yoriven realized they had made one mistake.
They had assumed that this [Knight] thought he would ever lose. Yoriven said it, gasping, as his friends picked him up. Whispered through a broken tooth as he slipped into unconsciousness.
“He’s…counter-levelling.”

First his hands felt like they were on fire. He threw every punch with the last ounces of his strength and they hit his opponents like avalanches. Then he heard that Skill and howled.

A Goblin stood at the gates, an army in front of him. They realized what he was doing. Twenty [Knights] fell. And then they realized he would not fall.
Honor chained them. They could have broken it, but the [Knights] refused. He stood there, blazing like the sun. As they drew back, called on the Order of Seasons to remember their honor, he punched at the air.
Shadowboxing. Taunting them. When they jeered at him, demanded he surrender, he stood there and raised his arms to the sky.
That was when Dame Talia Kallinad realized the truth. She saw the Goblin raising his arms to the sky as each opponent fell.
Like the [Boxer]. Like a [Warrior] on every battlefield as he looked up, breathed in, and knew he lived.
A Goblin’s [Knight], with peculiar honor. A monster…
But look at him.
She had always assumed he didn’t deserve his class, [Knight], when she had realized the truth. Then she had asked why he was allowed to have it. She had treated him as someone who had to work for the right he had been granted and assumed that was how he saw the world.
That was a Human’s bias. She looked up at him, as his auras flickered and twined and merged, and saw him.
A Hobgoblin, bellowing at the sky. Catching a potion Markus tossed him. Surrounded by his brothers. By memory and glory and…
Proud.
He was the proudest, the most confident, the genuinely, truly, overwhelmingly satisfied [Knight] on the field. It was not vainglory. He stood in the middle of his valor and dared the [Knights] of Ailendamus to break themselves against him.
The [Knights] looked up at him and stopped the [General] from firing. Their classes stood in that gateway. And if they broke the faith he placed in them, they would lose it all.
So they waited, as the 30th [Knight] stepped back. Then—their army withdrew.
