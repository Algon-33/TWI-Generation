Now it was a shout, and it spread like wildfire to the people who had waited for this day. It could no longer be ignored, and they called his name once more.
Flos. The King of Destruction.
He had awoken. He had returned at last. Trey slept with that knowledge ringing in his ears and heard.
The declaration of war reached the palace the next day.
