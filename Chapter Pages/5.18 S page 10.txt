“Consider me defeated. What am I supposed to do?”
“Be honest.”
The words made her look up. Selys frowned at Pisces.
“I am being honest.”
“Are you?”
He challenged her. Pisces looked in Selys eyes. He had gray-green eyes, not vibrant, a dreamer’s, perhaps. But they were serious.
“You have been reacting to all that has happened, Selys. So much has changed for you. I understand that it must be…impossible in many respects. But have you truly taken a step back to think about all this?”
No. There was no stepping back in a hurricane. Selys shook her head. Pisces tapped the table with his cup.
“Then allow me to help. If you would.”
“I would.”
If he could make sense of it all…Pisces nodded.
“Let us ask one question then, and one question alone. Do you want the armor?”
Selys paused. Her instinctive reaction was to say ‘no, of course not’, but that wasn’t a true answer, was it? She spoke slowly.
“I don’t know. I haven’t really looked at it. I didn’t know what it was. Now I know. You showed me those stories in Pallass. And they were amazing! I had no idea that was what it was. I knew it was valuable. But it’s still like—I haven’t looked at it, you know? I didn’t care. When I saw my uncle, lying there—”
Her throat closed. Pisces looked at her. Sympathetically. Had Selys ever seen him look like that?
“Of course you didn’t pay attention to it. And that is the problem. You don’t know what others are so fixated on. You were cursed Selys. Cursed with a conscience. Cursed with affection. You cared about your uncle’s passing more than the armor. If you were greedy and selfish, you would not be in your predicament.”
Like the rest of the Shivertail family. Selys shuddered. That was true, though. She’d watched her uncle’s funeral this morning. It was too soon. But Pisces was also right in that she had to face it.
“Okay. Do I need the damn armor? I don’t know. I want to look at it.”
He nodded.
“Then perhaps you should. That would be an adequate first step. Do you wish to see it now? Or later?”
Selys stared at him.
“Wait, what? You mean…go to it now?”
Rain was pattering on the shutters of her window. Pisces nodded.
“Why not?”
Selys opened her mouth. It was under lock and key! It was being guarded! It was valuable!
And it was hers. She closed her mouth. And stood up.

Watch Captain Zevara was not happy that Pisces had emerged from Selys’ apartment with her. Nor was she happy that they’d forced the [Guardsmen] assigned to her to bring them to her and the room the armor was being kept in. The Watch Captain stared at Selys.
“You want to do what?”
“I want to look at it.”
“Now?”
Zevara was probably off-duty. But she’d come hurrying as soon as Selys had made the request. The Drake folded her arms.
“It’s mine, isn’t it? I want to look at it.”
“Yes, but the security is there for a reason, Miss Selys.”
“And it’s still my armor. Unless you’re not going to let me see it?”
Selys stared at Zevara. The Watch Captain backpedaled immediately.
“No, it’s just that—of course you can look at it. For how long?”
“Is there a time limit?”
Perhaps she didn’t deserve this. Zevara’s jaw worked silently. She looked at Relc. The [Guardsman] was leaning against the wall next to the iron door, snoozing. The [Mage] that Ilvriss had assigned to the door was glaring at him, clearly envious.
“Relc. Wake up.”
“I’m up! Do I get to stab anyone?”
