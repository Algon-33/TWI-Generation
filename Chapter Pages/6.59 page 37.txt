Erin leapt to her feet. The door to Liscor had opened and five familiar faces had entered the inn. Everyone froze as Montressa du Valeross and her team entered.
“Aw, no! Take cover!”
One of the Drake regulars hunkered down behind his table. The rest of the guests began to scatter. Erin glared.
“Oh no. You’re not allowed in here! This is my inn! Lyonette, where’s that death-curry?”
She reached for her knife. Palt raised his hands hurriedly.
“Peace! We just want to speak—”
“Not to me! Get out! This is private property!”
Erin pointed towards the door. The Wistram team paused. Isceil’s eyes flashed, but Pisces got up. He slowly walked towards Montressa.
All of the [Mages] drew their weapons. Erin yanked her knife out. But it was Jelaqua who leaned out from her table.
“If anyone casts a spell, I’ll smash their heads in.”
The Wistram team paused. They lowered their weapons. Montressa stared at Pisces. Her face was pale. Pisces looked at her, and then turned. He addressed her and the room.
“I made a terrible mistake once. And because of it, people died. I never intended it. I just wanted to prove there was a place for me at Wistram. I loved it there. Before people knew who I was. I wish they had not adored my mask so much.”
“What? Is that—”
Isceil’s voice was muffled as Palt pointed a finger at him. Pisces went on. Now he was only looking at Montressa, at her eyes. Hate and fear and hurt. All mixed into one.
“I’ve done many things. I’ve hurt people. Stolen. I’ve lied. To myself most of all. And I will pay for those crimes.”
She blinked. The Wistram [Mages] stared at Pisces. Beza spoke slowly.
“Does that mean you’re surrendering?”
Ceria shot to her feet. Yvlon caught her. Pisces shook his head.
“No. I will not submit to Wistram. Nor will I go back. I was judged, by one who knew the follies of [Mages] more than any other. Rightly or wrongly—I do not wish to rot in a cell or die.”
“You deserve it.”
Montressa whispered. She shook as she stared at Pisces. He hesitated. Then he bowed his head.
“I’m sorry Montressa. I never meant it. Never forgive me. But know that I never meant it.”
He looked at her. Then he turned and walked away. Still as a statue, the Wistram [Mages] watched him go. Erin exhaled. Montressa’s expression had changed not one bit. But around Pisces, in him, she thought she saw something disappear. Something heavy. He still had guilt on him, but it wasn’t an anchor anymore.
“You did the right thing, Pisces. Thanks for telling us who you were. Someday I’ll have to tell you about my life in return.”
Yvlon raised her cup as Pisces sat down. He smiled, shakily.
“Are they still staring at me?”
“Like daggers.”
“Let them. Or kick them out. They might be Wistram, but this is Liscor. And The Wandering Inn! They can’t do anything here!-”
Selys looked savagely at the [Mages]. She turned as Erin zipped past her. The young woman was conferring with Lyonette. Then Erin looked up.
“Found it!”
She threw open a trap door and hurried into the basement. The Horns, bemused, but sensing something, heard Erin shouting.
“Hey Numbtongue! What are you doing down there? Practicing your guitar? Help me find that soap Lyonette bought! And come upstairs!”
Erin raced back up, a bunch of powder in one bucket. Lyonette was already dragging a copper tub they used for washing out. Bemused, the crowd in the inn watched.
“Here it comes. Here it comes…”
Relc rubbed his claws at one table. Klbkch drank agreeably.
“I have missed this.”
Erin was mixing up water and the powder. She put a hand in.
“Wow, that’s soapy! No wonder—okay, get a mop! Ishkr!”
