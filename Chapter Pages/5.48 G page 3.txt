“Not Redfang. But fought one once.”
The other Goblins murmured in appreciation as he showed them a large scar on his stomach. A few of the Redfangs nodded, acknowledging the deed. Rags smiled.
“Can kill Gargoyle, but not stand up?”
“Can stand! Not run. Too tired! Heavy club!”
The fat Hob shouted at Rags. She shook her head dismissively. She switched to the common tongue.
“Only heavy club? In that case, get bag of holding! Noears!”
The [Mage] rode over. Rags pointed at the bag of holding he’d been entrusted with.
“Take club. Then Hob run. Too lazy otherwise.”
Noears glanced at the Hob. The fat Hob blinked and stared at the bag of holding. He opened his mouth to protest, then realized he’d been tricked. Silently, he unfastened the club from his back and handed it to Noears. The club vanished into the bag of holding.
“Now, up!”
Rags looked at the Hob. He hesitated and then stood with a groan. Rags smiled. She looked around.
“Other Hobs have heavy weapons? Give to Noears! Give armor, too!”
“But armor for fighting!”
One of the other Redfang Warriors protested. Rags glared at him.
“Where fighting? We run! Come! Humans following! Follow! Not hard! Chieftain can do it and she smaller and younger than you.”
Rags jogged forwards. The Redfang Warrior flushed as the other Goblins laughed and shrugged off his armor. He tossed it at Noears as he easily caught up with Rags. She grinned at him.
“Redfangs supposed to be strong! You ride wolf too much.”
“So does Chieftain.”
“Not today.”
The Redfang Warrior grunted thoughtfully. Rags turned.
“Follow!”
She began to run. Not quickly, but at a lazy jog. The Goblins watched her. Rags wasn’t moving fast. Not at all. Why, you could sprint three times as fast easily. Four times as quick if a monster was chasing you. A few of the children ran after Rags. They waved at the adults. Look! Look, we’re following Chieftain!
Rags smiled. She moved through her tribe, reaching the front. The Goblins in front watched as she jogged past them lazily. She waved and then heard a thumping pair of steps behind her. She turned her head and saw the fat Hob had caught up.
“Tired!”
He complained loudly, but he was running, matching her shorter strides with his long ones. Rags laughed at him.
“Chieftain run too fast for you?”
A spark entered the Hob’s eye.
“This fast? Easy. Can run for hour. Without club.”
“Good! Hey! You, follow!”
Rags grinned. Her tribe watched her as the children, the fat Hob, and the Redfang Warrior jogged after her. They looked at each other.
A female Hob was next. She grinned as she tossed a dented helmet at Noears. She ran forwards, her long legs easily catching up. A pair of smaller Goblin females followed her. And then a dozen Goblins. And then hundreds. And then all of them.
“Follow Chieftain!”
Noears pointed and shouted. He was being besieged from all sides. The Goblins were throwing armor and heavy weapons at him and the Goblin [Mage] was swearing as he tried to collect it all. He leapt from the back of the mare and began to run, stuffing objects into the bag of holding. All the Goblins were running now. Pyrite grinned as he ran next to Quietstab and a group of Hobs. They’d found a second wind during the short break. All the Goblins had.
“This fast is easy! Slow! I swim faster than this!”
Rags shouted at the Goblins behind her. They hooted and some shouted back insults. After all, Rags had rode this far! What did she know?
