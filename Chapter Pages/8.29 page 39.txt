The revised chapter is still being worked on and I don’t know if I’ll get it done until after my break. Which is fine; I should edit when I’m at the top of my form. You can’t rush good storytelling, so it’ll be out when it’s out.
One more chapter. Thanks for reading! It’s not the end. It’s just something different.
